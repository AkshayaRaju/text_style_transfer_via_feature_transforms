i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years . 
this product does what it is suppose to do . 
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker . 
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart . 
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  . 
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one . 
i use this as a little office supply shelf . 
durable and seems similar quality to apple products . 
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased . 
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof . 
make sure the pins line up with the contacts . 
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost . 
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod . 
product arrived on time and was wrapped well . 
i had it a long time now and i still love it . 
this offers really good protection for the phone . 
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across . 
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far . 
the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great . 
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all . 
sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . 
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone . 
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out . 
i have several of these ,  well worth it . 
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda . 
i believe it was about $ when it came to market . 
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options . 
the whole thing gets hot when you use it . 
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price . 
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware . 
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size . 
great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix . 
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping . 
i don t think pie weights are for me . 
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  . 
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second . 
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative . 
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great . 
this happened after about num_num years of use . 
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse . 
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible . 
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days . 
easy to put on and i have no problems . 
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist . 
it was just one and that s not a big deal . 
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off . 
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger . 
i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  . 
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning . 
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature . 
even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle . 
i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape . 
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations . 
and yet it is compact and not too heavy . 
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon . 
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours . 
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation . 
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling . 
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes . 
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller . 
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces . 
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long . 
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off . 
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that . 
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy . 
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough . 
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping . 
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary . 
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes . 
i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem . 
it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder . 
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands . 
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could . 
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer . 
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight . 
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel . 
it works great and i am very happy with it . 
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order . 
i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is . 
 i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  . 
this one does the job i need it for !  . 
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender . 
the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far . 
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade . 
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle . 
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use . 
overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again . 
i have two of them in different locations in my house . 
the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion . 
they come with full instructions and not much more to say . 
went looking for them and you had them . 
i have been extremely happy with my purchase . 
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess . 
fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil . 
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement . 
no battery to wear out and have to replace . 
like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok . 
this gets the job done for the price . 
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier . 
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . 
it pushed right through the job with no trouble . 
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here . 
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film . 
i use it for my line of work and it stands up . 
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier . 
great headset ,  solid build quality and blocks out the wind . 
for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light . 
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable . 
i am so glad we chose this one . 
we use these alot and they work great . 
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh . 
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain . 
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine . 
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine . 
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours . 
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think . 
that s what it does and it does it well . 
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right . 
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance . 
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee . 
i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house . 
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action . 
i like that is is durable and washable . 
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses . 
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount . 
place it in the freezer and close the door . 
open carefully and handle the zippers with care . 
it had a great cost and a great product . 
these type honeywells have been around a long time . 
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products . 
it stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable . 
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy . 
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing . 
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all . 
it stay clean and does not collect food stains . 
i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry . 
easy to apply and it works very well . 
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it . 
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone . 
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling . 
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others . 
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods . 
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate . 
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours . 
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too . 
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do . 
easily moved to various locations depending on need . 
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work . 
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
i just got this and recently got a chance to use it . 
then along came this zester which i use constantly . 
i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  . 
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan . 
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose . 
tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager . 
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo . 
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms . 
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher . 
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . 
would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material . 
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased . 
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean . 
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest . 
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee . 
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone . 
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it . 
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym . 
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap . 
blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy . 
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time . 
i bought this is a gift for my brother . 
 : pi also have limited space in my kitchen . 
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier . 
maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings . 
i also love it because the jar is plastic . 
as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner . 
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal . 
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef . 
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones . 
i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost . 
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller . 
all came well sharpened and ready to go . 
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year . 
i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork . 
games like gem journey are easier to play with a stylus like this . 
it is great if you have more than one guest to serve . 
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully . 
i got this as a gift for my son . 
i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds . 
making seperation and cross contamination containment a very easy . 
i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  . 
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen . 
the zester was easy enough to clean after use . 
but for now ,  i m quite happy with this . 
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well . 
 the last time i did it was a year ago  . 
this product is being used for dollar size pancakes . 
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged . 
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review . 
love it !  really handy to set by the stove . 
adequately long cord . made in china ,  hence no reliability . 
but this one does the job very nicely . 
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate . 
plugs the ipad into my car and works great . 
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised . 
i like it better than any of the forman items . 
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato . 
once it dies i will purchase a better unit . 
otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price . 
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like . 
nice not to have a burner going for hours . 
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before . 
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made . 
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes . 
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates . 
just wipe the plates with a paper towel . 
i can t believe that i didn t buy these sooner . 
the recipe that comes with it is tasty . 
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity . 
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length . 
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years . 
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done . 
for the price ,  this is a good buy . 
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special . 
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer . 
then both of them go into the dishwasher . 
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning . 
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected . 
this pan i have had for one year . 
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn . 
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice . 
really confused ppl riding with me at first . 
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did . 
i can t remember when i first bought this timer . 
it does not slip all over the place when using . 
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with . 
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops . 
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out . 
i liked this and was happy with my purchase . 
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease . 
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality . 
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer . 
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp . 
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it . 
hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle . 
you have to break it in ,  in other words . 
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership . 
for my purpose this is the perfect item . 
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
great case ,  easy to use and very durable . 
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job . 
i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious . 
have been using it daily since it arrived . 
i have both a square and round pan i use this with . 
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart . 
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage . 
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte . 
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t . 
it seems to be of very good quality in its build . 
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer . 
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips . 
i have been using one for nearly num_num years . 
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one . 
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours . 
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one . 
more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product . 
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it . 
this is what s affordable right now ,  so it has to do . 
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it . 
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened . 
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be . 
i ve only charged it once since i bought it . 
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate . 
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months . 
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet . 
i will update my review after num_num months . 
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island . 
also cheaper than going to the grocery store . 
no complaints and my wife loves the color . 
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews . 
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies . 
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried . 
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards . 
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure . 
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid . 
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure . 
just make sure that you don t misplace the spout stopper . 
i received them as a christmas present and i love them . 
it did what it was supposed to do . 
put num_num quart of water into the machine . 
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board . 
i use is for more than deep frying . 
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking . 
it was the finger next to his hole finger . 
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream . 
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean . 
only negative was delifery was num_num days late . 
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon . 
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent . 
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly . 
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window . 
love this mixer ,  wasn t near as loud as some were saying . 
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job . 
glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones . 
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time . 
then into my phone and it chargers my phone . 
great dutch oven ,  works well and fun to use on camping trips . 
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available . 
this turner has worked well for the last few years . 
heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table . 
i have not been able to stop using it . 
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming . 
i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet . 
i was glad to see it was still available . 
very easy to put on ,  no bubbles whatsoever . 
i can see i will be using it a lot . 
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy . 
the complication is the heft of the phone . 
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse . 
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker . 
my dish feels very solid to the touch . 
this is definitely not the case with the num_extend
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise . 
but these knives are well worth their price . 
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance . 
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite . 
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery . 
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it . 
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again . 
then i thought something was wrong with my car . 
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating . 
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized . 
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate . 
simple !  does the job it was intended for . 
i ve been using this for months ,  and like it very much . 
it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   . 
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j . 
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it . 
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were . 
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new . 
i would recommend this case to my friends . 
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement . 
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps . 
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product . 
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast . 
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm . 
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed . 
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional . 
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend
i could not tell a difference at all . 
i have been using this grill for num_num years . 
i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do . 
i would not suggest this on black iphones . 
it is close to the old one i had for years . 
one to another company and two to amazon . com . 
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle . 
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt . 
no problems with this and worked with many devices . 
either you will like it ,  or you won t . 
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would . 
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice . 
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead . 
it is not difficult to clean or assemble . 
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick . 
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa . 
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while . 
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them . 
take the whole thing out in the sink . 
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use . 
it s very easy to use and very dependable . 
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms . 
i ve owned this crock pot for several years . 
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer . 
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray . 
i think this case is a very nice phone case . 
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it . 
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck . 
the item was what i was looking for and arrived exactly as described . 
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect . 
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case . 
but the back side looks nice as well . 
i bought three of these units to place in our home . 
and that would be what you would need . 
it works fine and the coffee is just as great !  . 
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it . 
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder . 
it s a very good quality at a reasonalbe price . 
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied . 
this knife sharpener more than met our expectations . 
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller . 
perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works . 
and i have tried a lot of them . 
i give it five stars for making eating good so easy !  . 
i can t believe how strong this little guy is . 
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum . 
despite the port breaking it gets num_extend stars . 
synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required . 
wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is . 
a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better . 
i love the floral design and the colors . 
very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection . 
we often cook sausages ,  hot dogs and hamburgers in it as well . 
snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned . 
yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic . 
i use this with afresh to clean my cook top . 
doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do . 
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner . 
the grill surface is easier to clean than our other grills . 
the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part . 
i feel like i have a new phone . 
it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds . 
plus its from amazon and amazon wouldn t put their name on crap . 
another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets . 
he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website . 
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x . 
i have to say that it was money well spent . 
it stores in a really small place and is built to last . 
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil . 
what a change in my life this will make . 
this is the second one of these i have purchased . 
it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating . 
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface . 
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear . 
once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away . 
it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available . 
still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good . 
it was just what i expected it to be . 
i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device . 
my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too . 
i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke . 
it works as expected and is just the right size for the camper . 
a meeting my phone is in the bag charging . 
white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer . 
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking . 
this item works just as i thought it would . 
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made . 
i read all the reviews and decided on this one . 
of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering . 
i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill . 
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times . 
a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers . 
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season . 
the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes . 
i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back . 
should have a wider design for different foods . 
its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit . 
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips . 
this is the best cookware i ve ever owned . 
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry . 
around the same time my dad got his very first iphone . 
it can charge a usb device while charging your phone . 
after about a week ,  the whole basement was a little clearer . 
i wasn t expecting much because theprice was so low . 
it is generic product ,  but worth every single penny . 
this headset can take a lot of abuse . 
just the right size for the in between jobs . 
very small but it works great in the car . 
i can hear a noticeable amount of hiss and loss of clarity . 
i don t see how you can beat that . 
for the price ,  this knife does the job . 
best case out there for an extended battery . 
just have to be patient in installing ,  also have really steady hands . 
i did a lot of research before buying this processor . 
nice pan !  this pizza pan is a great size . 
i don t mind that and just get another one . 
does require a bit of guess work ,  but still not difficult . 
this is the best blade grinder i have found . 
i really loved it and will use it alot . 
not totally regularly shaped ,  and look a little cheap . 
love the quality stainless ,  as well as the long slender design . 
look great !  neutral to go with any curtain color . 
charge performance is quick and handles all that i throw at it . 
the water is just as tasteless ,  but the flow is much better . 
i can roast vegetables quickly in it ,  and even bake muffins . 
there were campsites where i was the only one with cell service . 
i have the silicone handle which helps prevent burns . 
preheat the press with hot water while getting coffee ground and heating water . 
boil water until timer darkens to your specific needs . 
nokia suite will offer to upgrade the software from num_extend to symbian anna . 
if you have a choice ,  i would definitely research shun and henckel . 
the bottle is leak resistant with zero condensation . 
you have evenly cooked ,  crispy pizzelles in no time . 
fits very well and is durable plastic for good protection . 
the business i work at is very problematic for cell phone reception . 
and dont want to carry a purse or wallet . 
blade is really sharp and got the results that i was expecting . 
this vornado heater is pure luxury to me . 
my husband usually uses my hand mixer beater to whisk sauces . 
this machine is easy to use ,  just plug and go . 
this will be my second of these scrapers . 
not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected . 
i am very happy with the purchase and the installation was easy . 
it seems that all of the family didn t have enough chargers . 
they re my favorite glasses for serving up mixed drinks . 
it really just sits lightly over your ear . 
i bought this on amazon quite some time ago . 
everyone recommends this knife ,  so no one will read this comment . 
i purchased a few of these to keep at different locations . 
i bought this pan specifically to make corn bread . 
the wide top reduces and concentrates flavors amazingly fast . 
i ve been a fan of otterbox products for a long time . 
give it a chance ,  you won t be disappointed !  . 
it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great . 
this is a manuel machine ,  but it works great . 
wish i didn t have to buy two though . 
this pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops . 
this machine just keeps on brewing and frothing . 
the extra life of these batteries was overrated . 
five days a week we use the beeps as our alarm clock . 
so ,  it won t bother me when i work . 
it also will tell you when you have turned it off . 
i have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased . 
practical tips for quick and sure assembly :  num_extend
my first tuna asparagus creeps in cream sauce were a success . 
it grinds grains without making too much noise . 
awesome stylus !  perfect weight ,  size and love this type of tip . 
i really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look . 
so ,  you always have to have a hot pad or towel num_extend
i hastily ordered her another one and it arrived on time . 
they really are invalueable and worth every penny . 
dust ,  sand ,  dog hair ,  cat hair and a leaf . 
shaped a little weird ,  but is an awesome fan . 
it isn t very convenient though compared to a real lid . 
very durable and total molded design is great . 
it charges anything that uses usb ,  just like you d expect . 
also it is larger than it looks in the picture !  . 
i have purchased these for gifts as well . 
i m an avid amateur cook ,  and love entertaining . 
frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable . 
most new phones are going to soft buttons . 
they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up . 
a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far . 
the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it . 
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds . 
i am a first time user so am not an expert . 
it still cooks great and cleans as easy as it did new . 
do it right and it will make a nice seal . 
it also allows sending text messages through desktop  when phone is connected  . 
it works like a charm and you really get a very similar product . 
seems to be in great condition ,  arrived very quickly . 
all stainless ,  so don t worry about wearing anything out . 
this was an easy fix up for the board . 
will review again when i have more experience with it . 
this knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box . 
this is about the same size with the same size screen . 
if you own a evo you should own this as well . 
i even wrote to krups and was not given any explanation . 
i bought these because my zaggs wouldn t stay on while running . 
this is very nice i had to register this handset . 
the light indicators for the battery life and connection status are wonderful . 
i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart . 
it works for my iphone num_num that needed a new battery . 
the back plate offers great protection and new charging options . 
that is a bit awkward but eventually it worked . 
but the thing is ,  i don t think they should bend . 
i need to up my game to keep up with my new board . 
i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years . 
i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems . 
the outside chrome part ,  does get very hot . 
and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface . 
of course ,  you ll probably figure that out for yourself . 
this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone . 
charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate . 
excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well . 
i gave it the benefit of the doubt and used it anyway . 
is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
its a neck lanyard which is pretty standard . 
i highly recommend it !  you will not be disappointed . 
as for the pan itself ,  i couldn t be happier with it . 
you release the lock mechanism at the top and press down . 
use wooden or plastic utensils and you won t scratch the finish . 
the blender does what a usual blender is supposed to do . 
i bought num_num sizes of the golden holiday tablecloth and matching place mats . 
everything sticks and it s a bear to clean . 
cost $ and had plenty to choose from . 
i love the blade cover; that s probably my favorite part about this . 
i was able to sync this within about num_num minute to my droid num_extend
everything fits perfectly in the case and it makes everything much neater . 
i love the look of this charger first off . 
the agility has a removable hood making this area easy to clean . 
otherwise ,  the calls seem good on this plantronics num_extend bluetooth earpiece . 
a also like the web strap underneath it fits about num_num wash cloths . 
this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection . 
the powerful motor is more than enough for any job . 
it s had the best crema on my espresso this side of italy . 
my charger works just fine .  .  . it charges my phone quickly . 
buy more than you think you need ,  you ll use  em . 
the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations . 
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet . 
only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference . 
after that i gave the slicer another chance . 
highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators . 
used this to shove into doughnut holes  i cheated on actual cake pops  . 
this was a really good price for the cord . 
sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places . 
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness . 
this one was at a great price and it works well . 
if you love apples and pears ,  this is a must have tool . 
that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars . 
i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great . 
we have used it every day for a month . 
would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products . 
upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work . 
the curved shape of the premier is the shape of this little processor . 
i do hand wash ,  immediately after use and then dry . 
i assure you that the product is as good as these reviews claim . 
the pots has a nice weight to them . 
the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill . 
i was so happy i bought the regular jar sealer also . 
works effortlessly to make smooth ,  thin sheets of pasta . 
this is a must have for the phones . 
no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind . 
i m glad when i did ,  i chose a boos . 
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well . 
protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off . 
so i decided to get myself a second one . 
the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough . 
much cheaper than the apple version and works just as well . 
haven t dropped it yet ,  so hopefully it will hold up . 
i have the time and the inclination to can again . 
i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me . 
i am happy with the order and you will be too . 
the lip on the top makes for pain free pressing for continued use . 
these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs . 
we have num_num of these pots at church . 
it is great for traveling and using the map app . 
i did and this was the closest to my old one . 
i have thrown out many others ,  i always have two on hand . 
the soft plastic lid seals tight enough to use it as a shaker . 
this counter undercount is awesome and i have more counter room . 
we have had these same shears for years . 
really liked how grippy the sides of the phone are . 
i normally go though cases in a few months . 
each glass size ended being exactly what i like . 
great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device . 
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis . 
i use this in between with just hot water . 
thanks to the seller for sending me a quality  new  product . 
nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality . 
about this product because of the low price . 
i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one . 
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer . 
to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these . 
this is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders . 
it works great for reheating soup or making instant oatmeal . 
and is the best quality cast iron cookware made . 
great coffee maker and very easy to use . 
first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel . 
practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time . 
it recharges quickly and i make sure it s always ready to go . 
these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly . 
these make nice gifts that won t break the bank . 
i will not have my iphone until april . 
i won t take a star away just for preference . 
i own several timers and this is my favorite . 
works perfectly and much better than non htc charger on my hct phone . 
the audio is great and people never complain about not hearing me . 
excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price . 
it s also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries . 
this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity . 
i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions . 
everyone loves this juicer ,  and they are easy to use and clean . 
that s just the nature of cast iron cookware . 
it has never failed to open what i needed opened . 
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money . 
i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky . 
and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction . 
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup . 
this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding . 
this was a cheap solution to my problem . 
arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated . 
i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage . 
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones . 
this shaker is all glass and stainless steel . 
it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . 
within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break . 
it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm . 
access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed . 
it works amazingly and stands up to a lot of abuse . 
two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn . 
i bought this item to listen to much while i ran . 
it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color . 
that stand is locked in there quite well . 
so there s a guessing game in that regard as well .   . 
for normal phone tasks ,  the boxwave works great . 
i just wish acrylic had a few more products along this line . 
love all the color cases for such a cheap price . 
i can pop it off and clean it easily . 
over time i ve become a fan of oxo products . 
i put any delicate items that need to be washed . 
once that s been taken care of though ,  this thing really cooks . 
the result ,  i m not wasting gallons of water . 
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling . 
this device does both of those actions quickly . 
you really can t go wrong for this price . 
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly . 
much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque . 
my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on . 
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine . 
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping . 
on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts . 
the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you . 
calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware . 
overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect . 
i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone . 
ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this . 
it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet . 
these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan . 
i love my knives and this is fast becoming a favorite . 
this pan is the perfect size for my household . 
this makes that particular part difficult to clean . 
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod . 
the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort . 
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots . 
plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat . 
we have the older model of these delonghi radiator heaters from a relative . 
i also found that it had a pretty long battery life . 
i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
we totally love its versibility to mount is various areas . 
i suggest you give it as a gift . 
this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream . 
in that time ,  i ve managed to drop my phone several times . 
the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose . 
i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . 
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned . 
a little more work to clean up after . 
i m hoping it does not develop a rust issue ,  who knows . 
this is probably the best bb for the money . 
much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops . 
i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but . 
keep charged batteries for spares when your battery goes dead . 
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking . 
this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well . 
use small amounts and use the shake method after salting . 
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen . 
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough . 
another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size . 
the icarrier is another well built battery by them . 
it took me a few applications before i got good at it . 
for the price ,  i doubt you can find a better carving knife . 
i put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there . 
rezound  ,  the thunderbolt s screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter . 
it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold . 
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge . 
this headset was purchased to replace a jabra num_extend
con :  nonepro :  it contains a sturdy yet beautiful cutting board . 
it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish . 
the phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery . 
it is very nice comes with a car charger and an aux . 
the same goes for beef and pork roasts . 
if you like guacomole or margaritas .  .  . this is for you . 
i use it when i clean the outside refrig . 
i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life . 
this is my third attempt at a thermal carafe . 
i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod . 
i had to season the press ,  but that was easy . 
it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense . 
like i said ,  it is not really steam . 
it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy . 
keep the phone clean and had no problem with it . 
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it . 
i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended . 
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering . 
i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . 
this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean . 
i just wipe them off with a damp cloth to clean . 
some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover . 
i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet . 
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad . 
wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable . 
these are great screen protecters and look very nice . 
these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen . 
we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more . 
these classic knifes are exactly what i expected . 
bench press ,  sit ups ,  etc .   these sets would be perfect . 
i don t have that fear with the vent mounting . 
update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway . 
i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc . 
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged . 
the glass protectors are catching on ,  check one out . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
this is really a great buy for about $
i had solid ones before with no rollers . 
i like to make water with fruit in it . 
the discount cards for places like cvs ,  walgreens ,  etc  . 
would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside . 
recommended for anyone who wants to save money . 
it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky . 
but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast . 
if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars . 
the long handle makes it top heavy when trying to rest it somewhere . 
there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews !  . 
thanks so very much for an awesome case . 
it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well . 
this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet . 
if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart . 
i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe . 
makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly . 
it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone . 
great buy !  i love to decorate my bb . 
this one will be coming out much more frequently . 
the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings . 
we were so happy that amazon carried this . 
hope this helps someone get a better idea of the product . 
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip . 
thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones . 
not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff . 
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame . 
very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
i unscrewed the fuse cap to reveal a tiny glass type fuse . 
they wash up easily ,  and the plastic container is perfect for storage . 
a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition . 
couldnt be that much harder to add it . 
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside . 
took me two tries but they work nicely . 
plus i ve found it to be very accurate . 
my fiancee picked it out and she loves it . 
use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems . 
bought as a gift after having the griffin num_extend amps car charger . 
it s pretty thin so just take care of it . 
i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection . 
they clean up in the dishwasher easily too . 
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen . 
it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly . 
these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones . 
it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic . 
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use . 
the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful . 
the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line . 
the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes . 
fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines . 
my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge . 
all you have to to is clear the cache . 
i like that the cord can be concealed in the base . 
however you want to get that ,  its up to you . 
the guard stays put for a long time . 
i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones . 
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today . 
we looked at several of these devices to gut a pineapple . 
after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling . 
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue . 
she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it . 
i changed my kitchen to white canister ,  coffee pot ,  etc . 
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you . 
juicer looks great ,  and is very well made . 
the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have . 
this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises . 
love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes . 
either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last . 
this one is being used at least weekly . 
however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean . 
i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this . 
i m dieting so i use an airpopper a lot . 
i could drive and get coffee faster than that . 
the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream . 
you need to balance size ,  cost and power . 
however ,  i m told there is significant noise at highway speed . 
the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working . 
your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk . 
this is a fine mug for teachers ,  business people etc . 
the tea is still burn your mouth hot . 
i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol . 
i like to make very large batches of soup . 
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade . 
i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better . 
i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself . 
it moves air quite fast for its size . 
this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance . 
we ve had this pan for a few years now . 
still ,  knowing what i know now i would purchase it again . 
however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside . 
it is curved and it helps shape the loaf . 
this is not just for paella and mussels . 
i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends . 
so i am experimenting with taking filling out . 
i especially love the built in strainers in the lid . 
you can never have too many usb chargers . 
the quality for the price of this pan is awesome . 
washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion . 
elegant enough to impress guests ,  but sturdy and functional for everyday use . 
very small footprint on the counter as well . 
really nice ,  sturdy measuring cups with good grips . 
have been needing one for awhile and decided to buy this one . 
the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside . 
for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime . 
this was a great replacement for our bodum french press . 
saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food . 
so in the future we will share one . 
it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well . 
using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now . 
it fell and scooped right underneath the egg . 
were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect . 
one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes . 
little by little ,  i am learning to make our food from scratch . 
these are hard to find in local stores . 
i must say that i love every one of them . 
i can t say enough good things about this great lid . 
i wish it would just beep until i shut it off . 
they also appear to be better made and more durable . 
all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone . 
so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle . 
if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters . 
we use this every morning making our espresso . 
you can use it to rest ,  flatbreads on it ,  too . 
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product . 
the screen protector is a nice feature as well . no complaints !  . 
keeps food warm and i am using it regularly . 
all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well . 
does exactly what you would expect it to do . 
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on . 
lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf  . 
i took a key to it and it still looks great . 
music and speech are rendered really ,  really well . 
you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer . 
i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great . 
the surface is  rubberized  so it won t slip in your hands . 
keeps our counters looking more neat and organized . 
hard to tell ,  however ,  when measuring water or other clear liquids . 
i use it everyday and its been great . 
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . 
my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings . 
great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened . 
having the right tools makes any task easier . 
perfect ,  well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz . 
ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray . 
it heats fast and is very efficient in heating . 
they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks . 
thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match . 
we got this after our old beater began to flake off . 
besides that it has been a great case . 
considering the above ,  it s well worth this price . 
bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers . 
not too big or too small but just right . 
i think they ll last as long as i want them around . 
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature . 
we are back to buy another cordless vacuum . 
but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to . 
it looks as good as it did when i first got it . 
great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price . 
love this knife ,  a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen . 
i wish i would have had this when i was single . 
they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well . 
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up . 
but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter . 
it s great because of it s heavy duty material . 
everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly . 
the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use . 
work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl . 
the parts were perfect and fit together easily . 
they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright . 
i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough . 
but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use .
