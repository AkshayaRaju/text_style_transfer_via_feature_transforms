there are rows of colored bubbles on the top of the screen . 
you only need to pay him num_num gems and that s it . 
i love dk but this game is pure garbage . 
luckily ,  ammo is not hard to come by at all . 
being a veteran technician this wasn t a concern . 
the ones i received has a straight plug . 
actually ended up sending it back ,  wouldn t fit in my space . 
these fell short on flavor ,  sweetness ,  and satisfaction . 
not realistuic with the phone hanging like that not so happy . 
solid rubbery heel not one of those silly heel caps that fall off . 
i found the same brand at locale drug store for $ a box . 
i ended up buying another ,  more expensive case . 
if i buy another ,  i will choose something of better quality . 
i would try another method in the future . 
i think kitchenaid should stick to countertop appliances . 
my skin broke out into this weird texture . 
i purchased this for my num_num year old aunt . 
if that doesn t bother you ,  they are great boots . 
but it does take some ,  and this device has zero . 
no big deal ,  right ?  !  but they are really ugly . 
is it skating physics that are hampering the controls ?  no . 
does not remove pet hair ,  lint or anything attached to the fabric . 
this occurs regardless of the cable ,  television ,  or outlet i use . 
there was nothing to love but pretty pictures and increasingly aggravating puzzles . 
i have num_num rescue dogs that vary from num_num lbs to num_num lbs . 
it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too . 
i won t be buying fish based cat foods by the case anymore . 
the blades are very small and might work fine on a kitten . 
i ordered this exact boot about num_num years ago and loved them . 
i discovered the problem during a num_extend road trip through colorado in january . 
one morning after rinsing i saw these little blackspecks in the sink . 
we ordered the lady bug land for our daughter for easter . 
sorry ,  i don t like these as they re just too big . 
i actually found it a little too loud even when shooting stills . 
flimsy ,  cheap ,  typical overseas construction so very befitting of the price . 
it didn t taste at all like orange or tangerine to me . 
nice look in our sink but it only lasted num_num weeks before rusting . 
i guess i just have to wait and see . 
the side effects of this outweigh the benefits . 
well i thought it went on nicely no troubles . 
i order this product ,  which btw was not exactly cheap . 
pairing from scratch required for the speaker to work . 
i will make it into an extension cord now . 
i have owned this product for num_num months . 
it s a shame because the quality otherwise seems top notch . 
other games have similar concepts ,  but this is really easy to use . 
this product has not diminish her desire to scratch . 
i had expected something by now but the results are mediocre at best . 
i just wanted a timer that would beep me every four hours . 
this saucepan may get num_num stars if it came with a lid . 
it came off all in one piece  not glued on well at all  . 
bitter and burnt tasting as with most starbucks coffees . 
not so great pans and screws fall apart !  . 
this is not enough for most smartphones today . 
these are worthless unless you think am is better than cd for sound . 
my iphone stretched the fabric to the max . 
i was looking forward to using this product . 
and gazillion does have great bubbles ,  but the machine sucks . 
but it s your carpet  and  it s a cat s world . 
toaster looks better but performs far worse than $ ones i ve had . 
i read all the installation instructions available and watched videos on youtube . 
we have had this since before our son was born . 
i don t know if it was a bad batch or something else . 
i was hoping the gc version was better . 
returned for a medium which is about num_num inches . 
could not get any power through the outlets . 
you can get the same result by putting some pennies in a can . 
not recommended for small dog ,  because it s too heavy for them . 
quite disappointed with this product ,  especially since it s a monster . 
i used this for my num_num gallon fish tank . 
cheap quality they broke right away but you get what you pay for . 
the build quality is ok ,  but it is % plastic num_extend
don t risk it or else i told you so . 
i also found this item to be quite expensive too . 
my four year old son just loves these plug and play games . 
to add insult to this whole thing the game is very short . 
my water taste still a little bad after filtering . 
saw this on tv and bought it on a hope . 
you navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad . 
the expensive price was what attracted me to this product . 
i installed it following youtube video and it wasn t that hard . 
they are nothing special ,  just beads in a colored block . 
it did not give any coverage and i did not see any results . 
it wears quickly and has a poor design . 
all they do is flap in the breeze . 
the cats do track it everywhere all over the house . 
it works for some things but is not suitable for my main purpose . 
i do not like returning merchandise ,  so was stuck with it . 
i paid premium dollars for a charge only cable . 
the consistent result is mascara on the lid skin above lashes . 
i think it is on sale sometimes for about $
it smelled really bad ,  i got a head ache . 
my diet is all organic and i have a regular work out routine . 
this is the worst tea tree shampoo i have ever used . 
the saying you get what you pay for fits . 
apparently the plastic in this litter box is not quite right . 
i find myself changing batteries all the time . 
they produced a new version and i have been able to use it . 
it just didn t work on my short haired cat . 
there are many people that are die hard loyalists of this series . 
lost a few stars as the description was not totally true to form . 
the fruit part passes the taste bud test with a score of %
basically it s a lot of trial and error . 
i was expecting something truly extraordinary ,  but they are actually very ordinary . 
i guess that is what happens when you are the  rookie .   . 
i didn t think eating oil was tasty under the circumstances . 
i would recommend you not to buy this eyeliner . 
i got one of these exact filters and it just stopped working . 
anything on the left side of me cut out . 
i checked the belkin one but it was worse . 
it would be great for someone with thinner hair . 
just as elegant as the pendant casing and chain . 
they think of it as a family member . 
the amazon reviews are mixed ,  and for good reason . 
the ads for this product never mentioned the  water requierment  . 
went with this one because it s made by melissa and doug . 
there s no  board game  mode like mario party has . 
there is one at wally world that is cheap and does the trick . 
spend the extra money ,  it is worth it . 
i don t own this toy ,  i ve only shopped for it . 
however ,  for the price and effectiveness ,  i prefer other products . 
would not recommend it or buy another collar from this company . 
and in ours ,  swiper isn t seen very often . 
last but not least ,  this $ is expensive to maintain !  . 
no wonder they could afford to reduce the price in this economy !  . 
suffice it to say i will never purchase skechers again . 
i don t understand all the positive reviews for these panniers . 
when they first arrived ,  they tasted very good . 
it s interesting that these cds play everywhere else . 
here s a creepy little elf and a book . 
the almonds added nothing to the taste ,  and the texture was obtrusive . 
the major requirement for scissors is for them to cut . 
the reviews make this sound like some kind of miracle cure . 
i ended up buying another one on vacation . 
my first try was with my home stereo . 
it seemed perfect for having around a house with two growing boys . 
this is another toy made in china that is a piece of junk . 
i gave them num_num stars because they are well made . 
i used whole milk and added milk powder ,  as the booklet suggests . 
they did not skimp on the length as all other lotion  companies  do . 
you keep it frozen til you need them . 
num_num yr old female carring her own stuff . 
if you are not comfortable with the idea then do not even bother . 
the fan s air output is pretty puny and weak . 
it s more flat ,  and does shed a num_extend
it doesn t make opening jars easier at all . 
what you get is a thin cheap material and poor looking design . 
the air tank is not big enough to shoot num_num darts . 
don t buy them unless you normally wear wide posts in your ears . 
also be careful if your grout isn;t sealed . 
i recommend anyone to avoid purchasing this unit . 
he was still playing with our other cat . 
i ordered them a few days after christmas  the ants are an additional $
i should have read the review for these . 
the can and bottle openers are abnormally shallow . 
and i am super happy with the purchase . 
someone in our company purchased this for a short term project . 
this one on the other hand ,  is nowhere near new and fresh . 
these were supposed to fit in the booda dome i purchased . 
at the same time ,  midrange and treble are very muffled . 
i didn t drop it or any rough handling . 
this is no way to pack an order . 
they are not the color they are in the picture . 
i blamed it on my husband for not treating it properly . 
the recoil would throw off the sight everytime i reset it . 
this is a big scam in my opinion . 
it did not help with his bad breath and tartar . 
it may be a great product if the weight is not that heavy . 
i immediately had a reflux type burning in my throat . 
nice case ,  but the white part got dirty very quickly . 
wont let me syncronize and when it finally does it disconnects . 
the books fell apart too easily ,  the quality was not good . 
i removed the car and it was covered in dust . 
if you go static ip ,  you are screwed !  . 
we did a real world distance test with num_num different whistles . 
if you do ,  it will take a long long time . 
but the drm just kicked it down to num_extend
i will post again once that one arrives . 
it s supposed to ,  but the frame was not trimmed correctly . 
but the soles wore out far too quickly . 
first of all ,  i don t own this product . 
basically it s an expensive car mount for your cell phone . 
i was completely disappointed with this product by russell . 
it may not be corn syrup ,  but it certainly is not wholesome . 
second ,  the cross hairs had no movement ,  like they were broken . 
so ,  no ,  i am not a fan and am very disappointed . 
plus ,  the drip pan is really cheap looking . 
i ve been using on products for a little over a year now . 
but the phone is supposed to have wifi . 
their expensive ink cartridges was another huge turn off . 
this gets a bit more juice out ,  but not much . 
vga resolution is about as good as you can get with this camera . 
a minor annoyance ,  but after a while ,  an unbearable process . 
they are too weak with thin plastic and too small for the phone . 
the application is smooth ,  but the product is really sticky . 
i ve got literally dozens of hand held devices . 
out of the the foods only three were liked by wife and kids . 
i like the pants so i chose to have them altered . 
i would never feed this to my dog again . 
like most asian electronics ,  it has too many features . 
i get the impression this light leakage is intentional to look cool . 
now ,  i started to see the same problem coming back . 
she just played it when she was really bored . 
on my first toss into the lake this disc sank like a rock . 
i got it on the lightning deal for thirty five dollars . 
 imho definitely wouldn t buy a shirt with this material again . 
i will add some photos showing the problems . 
i really did not see any difference with this lotion . 
we re going to give it a try and see what happens . 
i have to agree with the reviewer mystery maven . 
that s not even possible without the wii motion plus . 
but within one week ,  the same thing happened . 
this product did not help my system but everyone reacts differently . 
it was a good charger until i got my hard shell case . 
delayed shipping then missed cancellation ,  then when received . 
i liked the drawer ,  programmable code ,  and key backup . 
when i stopped using this cream ,  the contacts no longer turn pink . 
i would have returned it but i did try to use it . 
the advantage is that you can change disc without disrupting play . 
but it s true ,  this is no longer final fantasy . 
we had to add velcro to keep the flaps down . 
i have big minor issues with this unit . 
instead ,  just use generic stuff no one will take notice of . 
this is a creation that not even frankenstein would approve of . 
a design intended to fail . stay away from these . 
poor construction legs continued to fall off along with center gear . 
i have this model and it is huge and expensive . 
the shoes were nicely supportive as rockports always are and looked great . 
i would recommend this oil for body therapy only . 
every single thing in it is off course to the show . 
but only when oil is added to the formulation as a base . 
i used this product on damp hair as directed and styled as usual . 
i really wanted it to work ,  i wish it had . 
this is not my favorite product from olay . 
it is missing one major test and that is salinity . 
i m about halfway through the tube and will use up the rest . 
also ,  there seem to be two versions of this speaker . 
scholl s gel liners ended up in the trash . 
i get irritated under my breasts from bras . 
for some reason it wasn t recognizing on their system . 
was a waste of money to order this . 
the handle is big ,  bulky and heavier than need be . 
it s like sokal had a childish porn fettish all the sudden . 
these are very pretty and look like the picture . 
i am sorry to say that i returned it . 
the product description did not say not standard thread . 
i ve had it almost a year without any trouble . 
i see other reviewers complained about after taste and it being too strong . 
flimsy ,  slides back and forth when you go around turns . 
the waist isn t the size the size chart says . 
since it is tinted ,  an even application is necessary . 
i found the audio quality on it to not be usable at all . 
we spent over an hour chatting with tech support . 
once they were removed ,  the new ones popped could be screwed in . 
your hero bears no relation to the movie at all . 
i loss the pan and the expensive beef roast i was cooking . 
i wish i liked it ,  i wanted to like it . 
they advised me to exchange them or return them . 
read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished . 
i hope you consider this review with the others and weigh them out . 
the sound quality was pretty good when the connection was made . 
the game producers have had enough time to smooth everything out from live num_extend
use a duel charger instead with two separate cables . 
worked well for num_num months before it died . 
i think all thermometers should list a speed specification . 
dying in horizons gives you a  death penalty ticket  . 
mine broke num_num seconds into the first use . 
i assume from the pressure of charging the round . 
it does not work on my grooming table . 
i read most of the reviews and decided to go ahead . 
i ordered a size ten ,  but this one measures a little below num_extend
now i regret that decision to try it anyway . 
i dont know how this is an extra small . 
this is not good for any android tablet . 
this is way too small for drying anything . 
i didn t look like a better me at all . 
but i have only had it for six months and it quit working . 
later i tried the polder in a pot of boiling water . 
i bought this so i could keep better track of my butter intake . 
my other experiences with bushnell have been positive though . 
later the motor burned out in the middle of a grind . 
had this unit for num_num year num_num months and it just died . 
my inside kids continued to nibble at the pate . 
it is critical that my voice be clear when doing this . 
i noticed no difference ,  less a nasty taste in my mouth . 
it might never come out ,  well unless you come . 
however ,  it will not curl my lashes no matter what . 
this is pretty easy for a boss fight too . 
try to find one and try it on your dog before purchasing . 
they are just sitting in my drawers now . 
so rhyno cannot do gore after gore ,  because he would get tired . 
this probably won t burn through as fast as the charbroil grill . 
i prefer mann or mahle oil filters ,  both made in europe . 
i had bought a similar product in a dollar store for $
i attempted this num_num times on my hair and scalp . 
the reason i do not like it is that it is too chocolatey . 
this is more for teacup size dogs and not for small dogs . 
i have a pair myself ,  which i love . 
we use it daily ,  so we go through a lot of it . 
but no matter how fast i hit it ,  it only pauses . 
i also miss the mint smell of the conditioner . 
i m not taking a risk with my family . 
you must remove from case to charge so it s inconvenient to charge . 
i had absolutely no luck with these at all . 
so i pulled this and the keurig attachment out . 
i fill it with treats and now he knows what to do . 
then my first radio died ,  shortly after warranty expired . 
looks like another reviewer had the exact same thing happen . 
your kids will get maybe num_num paintings out of this num_extend
do not buy these ,  look somewhere else ,  i threw them out . 
like most jergens lotions ,  just not this one . 
this stuff makes me feel like i have taken num_extend mini thins . 
the toy is small ,  and the squeak died almost immediately . 
coolness :  this item ranks pretty high on the coolness factor . 
i was naive to believe that i could get that in a dollar . 
zero ,  zilch !  i m still waiting for something to rescue me . 
tiger woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls . 
you need to send the item back to new mexico at your cost . 
the plastic zipper is actually kind of hard to manipulate . 
i keep seeing healthy treats and trying them . 
the feather blades are maybe the sharpest out there . 
other two shirts look like they will soon have the same problems . 
because of this the mirror could not be assembled . 
their reasoning was that it was heavily scratched . 
it has a little less carbonation than a coca cola would . 
i guess it ll just be a little sampler for my kitties . 
flaw num_extend grinded material gets stuck under the blade . 
if you can ,  inspect the cheaper binocs now before buying . 
i tried these brush heads as my teeth are sensitive . 
now because it bends so much ,  it does not cut well anymore . 
how anyone can give this title a solid num_extend is beyond me . 
not a product i can recommend to anyone . 
lifetime warranty too ,  amazing for a device like this . 
they want to wake the bees and have them fall in the tray . 
nothing wrong with flavor ,  but priced for kids that scream alot . 
the clinging powder just goes in the trash as waste . 
flavor is extremely mild ,  especially for a variety sold as  peppered  . 
this soup has a syrupy taste too it . 
he sings and hums almost anything he has heard before . 
i basically stopped using it and switched to plastic bags . 
there is a warning printed on the box  harmful by inhalation  . 
studies had success with num_num grams up to num_extend
does not plump the lashes like other brands i have tried . 
first let me say i m not a doctor . 
i ve already packaged it up to return to amazon . 
one was smooth and flavorful ,  another weak ,  and still another bitter . 
so ,  we need to return it somewhere ,  not sure where yet . 
but we want to buy what was in the sample . 
and for a very short bit ,  it did . 
installed fine on a very nice and fast pc about a year old . 
i simply did not want to take the risk  .  .  .   . 
i would not recommmend them because the comfort level sucks . 
i am the proud owner of num_num cats that i have rescued . 
you can buy a bag of balloons for less money than this . 
device is useless for num_extend the book selection is slim . 
out of the blue my flash stopped working . 
the music was decent ,  and i loved the opening anime music video . 
my daughter was given this toy as a gift . 
it is pretty cool when it lights up . 
i purchased a num_extend but the cup fit more like a dd . 
the smell is so strong it burns my eyes . 
i didn t feel refreshed ,  it was just sort of there . 
i ve owned the toshiba num_extend for several months now . 
i took the viviscal pills faithfully for num_num months . 
received a sealed box with all accessories included . 
so ,  i went ahead and ordered the set . 
the item arrived packaged in a cardboard box with little padding . 
i am sad to report that this is another piece a garbage . 
not sure how well this would really protect someone . 
the lock back lever is too tight for such a small knife . 
this slingshot looks really rugged in the pictures . 
i tried the sample ,  and it seemed ok . 
when a company does this type of mislabel i get so annoyed . 
i will not purchase this product ever again . 
do not be tempted to buy this product . 
buy any nylon bristle brush and you re in good shape . 
not impressed ,  plasticky feel and ran really small . 
i ordered an m and got something like an l or an xl . 
this one has a tie to keep the computer to the handlebar . 
i dropped this phone on the highway going num_extend it still works . 
they barked at me for num_num minutes straight . 
i like a product that holds the package securely . 
do not cut your meatloaf in the pan it will be a disaster . 
being that the cans are only num_extend ounces that s quite a lot . 
it is very sour ,  not very cherry to us . 
it also tracks a lot as it sticks to cats paws easily . 
the maps are so bad as to be humorous . 
you don t need to spend twenty bucks of an ipod touch case . 
it wasn t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs okay . 
i tried to supplement and ended up feeling really awful . 
hardly matters if they last longer if they don t sound as good . 
too expensive to keep when it hardly works . 
i have had a number of braun coffee makers . 
i purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer . 
maybe it s just to strong for my skin type . 
instead of getting cleaner ,  the stuff on it just got harder . 
the nintendo num_num version s graphics are much better looking to me . 
don t waste your time on this item .  .  . poor quality . 
i tried this product for a little over num_num weeks . 
we always brought a box to my grandma when visiting . 
my experience was great from the num_extend till a couple years ago . 
it might be a great product if you like the scent . 
however ,  when i received this watch the digital display is too faint . 
my screen stopped working a week out of warranty . 
i have no favorite brand but i wouldn t order socks online again . 
it has a good feel ,  and a nice rubber area to hold . 
it would be a rich flavor if it wasn t so bitter . 
the third  refurb  they sent me lasted for num_num weeks . 
i have had this cd changer for many years . 
arrives in a regular envelope and device needs to be pinched into shape . 
directions on how better to insert the treat would be appreciated . 
this is a case where too thin isn t desirable . 
this is probably the worst coffee i have ever had . 
buy them if you re only using them for tv and want wireless . 
very dumb move on the part of netgear . 
like other reviewers ,  we noticed the wheels do not move freely . 
the taste on each kind was just bland too . 
wish this transaction would of been a better one . 
it s time we got back to supporting our own economy !  . 
buttons are easily pressed ,  display is easy to read . 
because i d never spend this much on a pair of clippers . 
i heard good reviews about his product and decided to try it . 
i paid for quality but did not receive long term quality ,  sadly . 
they liked it for a minute and then gave up . 
i detest containers that require me to stick my finger in the jar . 
she has eaten this food before in the past and liked it . 
but i have a kitten and some of the clumps are small . 
i was too embarrassed to give this to my friend as a gift . 
she said that this product doesn t really work . 
all the animals talk like this ,  with various tonal differences . 
just save some money and buy a num_extend bucket at any hardware store . 
the fuel bottle and cap are not very good either . 
far better and cheaper options in the market . 
but the clasp started undoing itself within a year . 
it s fine when he curls up and stays within the bed . 
i used skinclearing liquid foundation for years and continued to break out . 
you expect the description from the seller to accurate . 
this is sadly not a good web browsing phone . 
after extended agony with the customer support ,  they simply got nothing . 
alex the kidd ,  phantasy stars from sega consoles . 
this scent smells like a dated num_extend cheap perfume . 
still i think that are much better healthy snacks out there . 
tried motorola web site ,  there is no driver download for this phone . 
this bra basically smoothed my breasts down and was not flattering . 
they smell the same and appear to be composed of the same material . 
disgusting !  rabbits in  rabbit farms  are not treated humanely . 
i ordered an num_num in white to fit my womans num_num shoe . 
the description says fits all smartphones but does not fit my galaxy note . 
i could not agree more on the issue brought up here . 
i ended up with about num_extend c of  soft serve  ice cream . 
i don t need the stop watch or alarm functions . 
not as cool as they make it sound . 
it doesn t live up to anything they said . 
if i wanted floppy ,  pale waffles ,  i d eat pancakes !  . 
so far the mouse walks right by it as if it is invisible . 
i ll be looking at other makes of appliances from now on . 
they have something real good ,  but its only the beginning . 
the beater was already loose when i recieved the mixer . 
rubber is way to soft they all num_num tore within three days . 
i ve never had any problems with balding until using this . 
this is a great nail too for regular nails . 
for me ,  this product is a no ,  no .  :   . 
i think the mistake was that the color does not have gold tones . 
it smelled better than i can even describe and tasted just as great . 
getting through this box and then going back to the bigelow . 
i did purchase one for my conquer num_extend
neither would work so i changed to a belkin cable that works fine . 
and is was over priced even for lego . 
i ve never felt it was stable even in camp on a table . 
fortunately ,  other items i had purchased were sealed in plastic . 
they could not have fit my dogs better ,  and were secured perfectly . 
i did not like this tea at all . 
volume down was sticky and didn t always register properly . 
the sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together . 
i can t rate it if i don t receive it . 
the game itself just makes my pc puke pixels all over my screen . 
not even one full charge ! conclusion :  look for something else . 
i am told you will love the game once you do . 
touch screen started failing after about a month and a half . 
have had a ton of critters through that time . 
it doesn t taste anything like okf s drink which is disappointing . 
you can hear the people on the other end crystal clear . 
no energy bursts !  ,  no body cleansing !  just a bad taste . 
i received my order promptly and as promised yesterday . 
i really should have done more homework before i purchased this product . 
my cats still track litter well beyond the box . 
not surprisingly ,  it also had loose parts wiggling around inside . 
there are many vegetables that pass through our kitchen . 
this num_num star  review  is to average that out . 
this hairball med was a complete waste of money . 
needless to say ,  it is in the closet until she gets older . 
instead ,  the main change is that resources are much more scarce . 
almost every vehicle you drive feels too big and weighty . 
and even if there was ,  warn your customer . 
i like that the rack moves forward when the door is opened . 
one kitty will really only eat raw fresh chicken or liver . 
unfortunately for us ,  this harness did nothing for our problem . 
i still hoped that i would really like this item . 
the guy that called didn t understand why that was a problem . 
would be great if it did not attenuate volume level . 
i still love china glaze polish but this is hideous . 
the product is not % parmesan cheese as it shows . 
friendly customer service though !  they were quick and helpful . 
in that case it may work well for you . 
i had one for a while and it did okay . 
i should know ,  we sell these at the store where i work . 
it maybe good for look but not protecting it from a fall . 
the holder sucks even with velcro holding it . 
then slowly but surely ,  they started to fail . 
maybe it is because it might be harsh on her skin . 
i was not a fan of the brush design either . 
the way they are set up just scream  leave game  . 
nice feel to fabric ,  and had high hopes . 
the game also had a dark atmosphere and that s a high point . 
i am returning this item only after using it twice . 
this one is the one she has no interest in . 
finding a chatsford requires the patience of a sherlock holmes . 
i should have came on a website and read reviews . 
i think my super nintendo had higher graphics than this . 
i will not order levi  s online again . 
might as well just take the free ones that come with drugstore num_extend
the new one is almost twice the size of the old style . 
don t get this if you re buying a christmas present . 
he has terrible red yeast stains around his eyes and mouth . 
so it is clearly a flaw in the product . 
first time like on the picture where it lays on the hips . 
these things fit nothing like the older num_extend
it worked well for a month ,  then crapped out . 
it s not their fault the product is mediocre . 
i have had much better toe warmers with other brands . 
at least to my palate ,  it was like eating nothing . 
people are constantly saying that i m breaking up . 
i knew they wouldn t ,  but this is ridiculous . 
and then the big one ,  it doesn t ever really become permanent . 
the first thing i noticed was that it took shaky photos . 
purchased num_num of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away . 
i m going to toss it ,  waste of num_num bucks . 
instead ,  they usually bounce out and roll away . 
not to mention ,  it takes forever to make a cup of coffee . 
i give this toy a num_num out of num_extend
the pump causes vibrations and some of the plastic parts rattle . 
it barely fit the mount on my baby eagle . 
i think it was cause of the sound it made . 
may give it to someone who has a larger dog . 
you get what you pay for i guess though . 
we have picked up a number of emerald nuts recently . 
so safety is my biggest complaint by far . 
well ,  i guess i should have taken the advice from others . 
another thing ,  the memory sucks even with a memory card . 
it is more like a big tea strainer . 
the voice acting is laughable and the graphics are pretty weak . 
it only lasted a few months . i bought one more . 
cans were only half mango with the other half juice . 
words just can not say how bad i think these disks are . 
good craftsmanship ,  durable case and bracelet ,  and very bright luminous markers . 
i bought this knife relaying on a reviewers information . 
i put on the first pair to wear straight out of the box . 
then it started jamming terribly and the pump stopped working . 
bumble bee is an old company and should know better than this . 
now in num_extend i had the urge to replay this game again . 
i ve never reviewed a product as a num_extend
i passed it on to my daughter and it okay for her . 
i have had this product for almost num_num months now . 
looking at this purchase ,  i shouldn t have expected much . 
the first one we received had no microphone response . 
this is a case where i got what i paid for . 
the fda has issued a warning about pet treats made in china . 
i decided to purchase replacement heads from walgreens retail store . 
bought this as a gift for a teenager . 
here ,  however ,  the concept failed in numerous ways . 
i have found it to be a waste of money . 
so these soggy beans will not be purchased again . 
their food almost smells better after it s been digested . 
this was a huge hassle ,  so i couldn t use it . 
clips were of very cheap material as well . 
no a word there about any issue good or bad . 
leave it in the bargain bin ,  don t consider buying it online . 
i tried placing them in corners of the room at different distances . 
only lasted a month on my num_num yr olds neck . 
might as well order the filter removal tool when you buy this filter . 
no idea why ,  but we tossed it and purchased a different charger . 
the product arrived fine but did not work for toenail fungus . 
however ,  my num_num year old chihuahua refuses to touch these . 
it may be more expensive ,  but it would be worth it . 
this thing is an extraordinarily expensive piece of junk . 
it works gently and normally takes num_num hours . 
pretty ,  but not worth buying . don t buy this game . 
look i cannot complain that the scent is different . 
i ll report more when i hear what they have to say . 
it s neat and sometimes helpful ,  but really isn t necessary . 
after using many times i see no difference at all . 
my old ge lasted num_num years and never had a problem . 
well i only have my own camera to compare it to . 
this brand is what they use at my dentist s clinic . 
think of this as the chevy chevette of palms . 
i can t delay to see what is in the num_extend flat . 
amazon as usual was great and gave me a swift refund . 
i can hardly hear the music in my car . 
two minutes after my order ,  my phone rings . 
swissco brush head is thinner and lighter and softer . 
the machine is poorly designed and cheaply manufactured . 
it is smoother than a pencil but not as smooth as a pen . 
i didn t get the results i was expecting . 
i would not recommend anyone buy this piece . 
i purchased this for a relative s stage ii decubitus ulcer . 
very surprising ,  actually ,  as it smelled sufficiently fishy . 
if you don t care ,  then these are wonderful and beautiful . 
the instructions say to knead the individual package before opening . 
i will be buying this again when the tube runs out . 
feels like a silicone layer on top of my face . 
the butter dish hardly fits in the opening anymore . 
just watch snooki in the earlier days and you get a visual . 
just don t expect to actually like eating it . 
i got this for my tent ,  but it wasn t worth it . 
i purchased this mangroomer back shaver num_num months ago . 
i ve beaten or at least accomplished a lot on many racing games . 
the taste lingers  which other reviewers have called an aftertaste  . 
they were so dry and the taste was bland . 
this stuff did not get rid of my acne or improve my scars . 
panasonic has dropped the ball on their headsets . 
longer or an extension would help solve that . 
my cat often throws up as soon as she s eaten . 
why not use the y button or the b button . 
it does block the view from the sides and does increase privacy . 
two stars because it doesn t do what it says it does . 
we had to cut the fingers off for my grandson to wear them . 
then the game starts and i quickly realized num_extend
the oven hadn t even made it to num_num yet . 
the sides are so weak that it broke the first week . 
although the concept is great ,  this product is not worth the money . 
did we really need all those details ?  yeah ,  we get it . 
i think there are many superior alternatives to the shampoo that are cheaper . 
why they would totally change everything about it ,  i can t imagine . 
i am assuming this is what made me break out like a teenager . 
is it present in dragon quarter  ?  well ,  yes and no . 
this is a heavy pan with a nice thick non stick coating . 
small dog equals small handle ?  their reasoning i do not understand . 
this tool just didn t work for me ,  i m afraid . 
the problem with this product is that it is highly toxic !  . 
it was not flush on the top left corner . 
the pc version had clean graphics ,  fast framerate and great sound effects . 
i have to strain my eyes to read documents on the screen . 
my final problem is with the cord length . 
the concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed . 
i guess my lab is too smart for this toy . 
so basically i was wasting taking health from enemies just for the ammunition . 
after the first couple uses it moved to the cabinet below the sink . 
i bought it on a whim to replace my old phone battery . 
everything else about the tripod was great ,  especially for what i payed . 
the split creates a sharp edge that may be dangerous . 
but i sure wish i had read these reviews before buying it . 
what a waste of $ shame on you ,  teva !  . 
there are times when the device doesn t acknowledge the remote at all . 
i ll stick with my oil of olay age defying cream . 
i have other leds that stay cool and will leave them on . 
i can t believe another reviewer gave this num_num stars . 
you have your ubiquitous  professor  character ,  and several npcs . 
i recommend the sims bustin out it is the sexiest gamma eva . 
i liked the charging it up idea and being portable . 
the batteries that i got only lasted me a few months . 
and good luck finding underwear to wear with them . 
i agree with all who complaint about the assembly . 
i find that these protectors are very thin; which is a plus . 
i remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke french . 
might last longer if your dog is not a chewer . 
the taste was great compared to this brand . 
anything you put in it will slide around . 
very comfortable boot ,  wanted it for rainy days . 
also don t get me started on the tripod . 
first of all menthol is used for its cooling value . 
i returned it and bought a hot seat instead . 
they seemed to like it for the first num_num minutes . 
guess that s why i have bought so many of them . 
for me ,  digestive issues are a common problem . 
i liked the way it ran really small . 
he cuddled the glowworm right away and called it baby . 
this product  the cream part at least  seems okay . 
it s a very nice design how you can cut it . 
these went together easy enough and they didn t look terrible . 
if they had a water proof version maybe that would be better . 
a smart phone must have a car charger . 
i also just experienced the water filling problem reported by other reviewers . 
i reserve that honour for  jekyll and hyde  . 
i thought linksys had the best reputation and products . 
this caused a wobble effect on one of the handles . 
i should have done the research before purchasing . 
so .  .  . sadly this router was a failure for us . 
and the epub size is much larger than pdf size  i . e . 
it didn t over dry my hair or moisturize it . 
it s a good thing i saved my old one just in case . 
i have eyelid and eyelash issues and needed it for that purpose constantly . 
i ended up just switching to a normal pinch collar . 
i bought this product to clear out my skin . 
we ate lots of little pieces of grey rubber . 
i wasn t able to get a close shave at all . 
you cant tell that the clip is made from cheap ,  flimsy plastic . 
it s also difficult to line up the door properly . 
the plastic where the band connects seems like it will break . 
gustbuster wants $  shipping and handling  to repair it . 
they work ,  but the life on them is short . 
i got num_num times the distance with a different router . 
however this one is not the best out there . 
i bought this for use with my new num_extend macbook air . 
it really diminishes the quality of your screen . 
i ve written to the company .  .  . so far no response . 
what s with the  do not shake  instructions ?  it isn t carbonated . 
for me ,  black coffee is a better alternative . 
and the blue plastic over piece of the case cracked . 
you will not be left with bouncy ,  hydrated shiny curls . 
this is a very over priced natural ineffective product . 
one of your first missions is to go to middleport . 
the colors are not bright even with primer . 
the only perks is the shine and the scent . 
now i have to buy a jack to go with a jack . 
point directly ,  push repeatedly ,  and maybe it ll work . 
it fell off easily ,  so it was bound to happen . 
fine for snapshots of your kids birthday party though . 
nonetheless ,  both keys that i have now do not work . 
we don t know where the problem is but it is shot . 
i really wanted to like this game ,  i really did . 
i went through three of these in num_num months . 
the shortest i ve ever encountered with this kind of product . 
the medium golden brown turned my roots red . 
sorry but i just don t flow that way . 
never again will i worry about being stranded with a dead phone . 
tried cleaning it and it wont come clean at all . 
seems to be pulling out lots of unmatted hair . 
might be a great fit for a bigger stature person . 
i didn t get into this game like others . 
slightly loose in the waist ,  but very tight in the rear . 
i played the first and fell in love with it way back when . 
i would not recommend any creative lab s product . 
it only lasted a week before my dog had destroyed it . 
this kong is more the size of a yorkie dog . 
then ,  about num_num weeks later it just stopped working . 
if you can get past sagats flying discs then he uppercuts you . 
chondroitin quality rated low by outside lab study . 
to me there are num_num types of pads . 
in fact the only thing i notice was constant red eyes . 
now it only runs about num_num seconds tops and goes dead completely . 
ultimately ,  the temperature i was measuring became guesswork . 
i would not repurchase another one if these cases ever again . 
i gave the plantronics a great review and am still using it . 
but the rubber started tearing away from the edge . 
unopened and they will not take it back . 
never has my dog ever had seizure until i gave her this . 
finally ended up getting a cheapy for $ and that saved the day . 
talk about bad timing to test a new camera . 
i blasted it with air and it was quiet . 
enemies who can t see you in plain sight . 
therefore ,  for now ,  it only gets two stars . 
i was basing the size by other dresses purchased . 
i remember installing patches one by one for ofp and that took forever . 
i kept the boat in ontario ,  and i live in pennsylvania . 
he thought i was insane and that it would be pointless . 
a simply amazing sound ,  with outstanding isolation capabilities . 
still ,  a bit sweet for my liking but better overall . 
i think rockstar just threw some  stuff  together while gta is still hot . 
i can t imagine why pyrex made this cup like this . 
few levels are at night so you better raise the settings . 
i found this product to be a major disappointment . 
twice it reset while i was napping on the sofa . 
this one is inexpensive ,  but i may go with another suit . 
i have enjoyed other hodgson products but this was awful . 
i was not impressed with this product whatsoever . 
it would wake me up sometimes but mostly my son slept through it . 
you ll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure . 
the unopened packages don t need to be in the refrigerator . 
i purchased this because it was by tigi and i trusted the brand . 
what other reviewers said about the pump and packaging is true . 
like several other reviewers ,  the product ruined the picture . 
it broke when it fell off my deck onto i pile of firewood . 
can t bring myself to use it since it smells so bad . 
i had previously tried the source naturals nko brand . 
i was sadly disappointed with the quality of this dog food . 
if you do ,  you risk the chance of irritation . 
i don t understand why it is so popular . 
i wish at least one or two manufacturers would stop outsourcing to china . 
it also leaves your lips thick and sticky . 
$ worth of aggravation is what you get . 
glad we didn t spend very much on it . 
the controller isn t nearly as comfortable as the num_extend
they are as pictured but are a very cheap quality . 
my other power kin is weird that way too . 
i guess not having to return it is worth one star . 
overall there isn t much i like about this product . 
even a simple square is a challenge to keep standing . 
then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard . 
the unit arrived dead out of the box . 
i have been intermittently using this because it irritates my eyes . 
it falls apart after one or two uses . 
but basically the toy is about num_extend and the tail is num_extend
too perfumey and its hard to feel clean when there is no lather . 
a quick google search for spare parts didn t return anything promising yet . 
a hitman is not a good idea for a video game hero . 
this is not what i thought it was going to be . 
i don t think i will order these again . 
i can not recommend this product to anyone . 
the open moat design causes a lot of problems . 
this is a case where you definitely get what you pay for . 
alas !  oh but the graphics are super cute . 
the mg++ does not scrape off and is not flammable . 
that was enough for me to throw the item in the trash . 
corn is one of the most common genetically modified crop in usa . 
i got the home theater system about num_num months ago . 
i am keeping it because it s too much hassle to return it . 
before discovering the heininger towels ,  i used the  standard  yellow ones . 
it just clumped up at my tear duct . 
i am resigned to not being able to make bread at all . 
it s easy to use ,  and fairly quick to brew . 
it blows it is a boring extremely hard game . 
no wonder there are so many reviews left by women wearing these . 
you end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand . 
it may not be compatible with magic jack but more like skype . 
i have a num_extend and i don t even want the others . 
it is pretty heavy and the tent sags when in place . 
i have listed a few of them for your benefit . 
the blade came razor sharp and i like the molded handle . 
who has three hours to get ready in the morning ?  not me . 
meanwhile ,  the breading has morphed into a thick blanket of blah . 
i m not sensitive to it so i definitely need it . 
i ordered a wide size but they just don t work for me . 
one slot is tight for the mag while the other side is loose . 
it just gives you a headache and dizziness . 
it was too strong for me to eat . 
but i bet they go to the bathroom and pick their nose too . 
too costly for something children will leave on the shelf . 
might be ok for people with very very big ears . 
i ended up removing the bridges but my cat still did not care . 
i m surprised by all the positive reviews of this lotion . 
it s adorable to look at ,  not to play with . 
we ve been buying fruit of the loom underwear for years . 
for now though ,  i love this treadmill and use it every day . 
so far num_num have been duds and gave off virtually no warmth . 
but i was looking for something more along the lines of working out . 
i haven t tried latisse ,  so can t compare it . 
pain to put on and worse to pull off . 
absolutely no pep !  it totally disappears on sandwiches . 
had a very bad chemical odor when i opened it . 
the great reviews swayed me and i got this . 
when it was still working ,  it constantly beeped and was very annoying . 
this is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler ,  while it lasts . 
but ,  i wish i had purchased something else . 
the fabric mesh case completely obscures access to all controls . 
the price was low ,  and the quality matched . 
i purchased this as a storage container for my dry dog food . 
but that didn t improve the problem at all . 
i even opt d to buy another two mags . 
they do have side pockets and a draw string waist . 
it gurgles and makes boiling noises all night . 
maybe it works better on  new plaque  that is just building up . 
cheap quality and very bad price for the item . 
this device was only effective about num_num times with my dog . 
want be a forth !  !  third time was the charm . 
my num_extend old did not like this toy . 
i just purchased the can from whole foods . 
such failed experiments included cookies ,  pancakes ,  and biscuits . 
any of those would be a better choice !  . 
i believe there is something toxic in this product . 
this has to be on the top num_num for installation and protection . 
it will run num_num ok with a noted reduction in bubbles . 
looks like plastic molding macchine may have made this one a dud . 
i wouldn t have liked them anyway ,  had my tv been compatible . 
i have had the item for a little over num_num days now . 
money was nearly impossible to come across unless you wow imagine that . 
does not matter xp or windows num_extend because tried on two pc . 
people has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs . 
i have owned the lights for about a year now . 
i figured i d just gotten a bad one and bought another . 
i ve gone back to just using a plain measuring tape . 
and there is tons of workouts you can do . 
one little design detail fails this case altogether . 
the scans were for the most part fine . 
definitely a good hard case to protect the phone . 
this item is not a sweat band for men who actually sweat . 
low price for a product that does not hold up . 
was able  with effort  to get num_extend flashed onto drive . 
however ,  after just num_num use ,  the plastic tops fell apart . 
also you can t just master a profession you choose . 
they directions were also greatly lacking in any real detail . 
there is absolutely no natural progression from one form to the next . 
not quite what you want at the er . 
my husband s first comment was the squirells can probably get into it . 
but this lens right out of the box had auto focusing issues . 
a piece fell off of it within a couple of weeks . 
i have to say ,  my cats are confused by this . 
will update this review after i try them . 
i expected a softer chew but they are as hard as a bone . 
up walks forward and right and left turn . 
it should have costed num_num cents because thats how crappy it was . 
when i played it though ,  the experience became quite a different one . 
canon fixed it because it was still under warranty . 
but he is not impressed with this toy . 
the same thing followed on all the rest . 
great smell ?  ?  i am not really sure about that . 
as far as coconut waters go ,  this is poor . 
that way if the mount breaks ,  you will not lose your camera . 
i got the product full of scratches and cracks all over . 
too bad i lost the % discount i used to buy them . 
don t get stuck with another $ kitchen timer like i did . 
when you plug it in with ac ,  you get noise on am . 
the quality of the shoe is misleading for an addidas product . 
she also needed fortiflora to destroy the bad bacteria in her colon . 
thanks for nothing . got up today and called again ,  business hours . 
and my teeth were only a tiny bit whiter ,  if anything . 
he destroyed these in less than num_num hour each . 
they were far too expensive to be so poorly made . 
wish i d have put the money to something else . 
they always come out with wierd yellowish colors . 
don t waste your money on this sorry excuse for a dvd player . 
it s just string covered in a sticky wax . 
i m so glad that i rented it and didn t buy it . 
excuse me ,  it is not a flat surface . 
not my cup of tea ,  or should i say coffee . 
also ,  the scalloped edge of the scoop doesn t help anything . 
we bought this for our son for christmas . 
i got canker sores on my tongue while using this . 
the most intresting is to use a segment of a telescoping antenna . 
it just blurs the numbers . oh yeah ,  it s cheap . 
it was a mistake buying the nerf rapid fire num_extend
it quickly discharges ,  when it gets to % charge it goes dead . 
this game has bad graphics ,  bad music ,  and bad gameplay . 
we are hard on our iron ,  using it daily ,  dropping it . 
it doesn t really give you twice long of battery time . 
very disappointing that the product description was inaccurate and misleading . 
i thought that this would be a handy little back up saw . 
this hat is too tight for comfort and has not stretched . 
this cream based on reviews  seemed like a great option to try out . 
he s actually mad at me because i won t throw it away . 
but after trying a different brand i know better . 
if the shipping was free ,  i d consider getting another one . 
i bought my second expert mouse here on amazon in num_extend
the compression is also starting to wane in the ankle area . 
i gave it to a friend because i hate throwing stuff away . 
but the problem may well go beyond the dishonest bums at cmple . 
they must of use cheap petrol base material . 
it might work . beside this ,  the machine is good . 
 vlad the mad  who have num_num out of num_num helpful votes . 
probably ok for a body brush but it s too small . 
the second problem was this bra has a defect in the front . 
it focused more on the play ,  rather than the education . 
in the future i plan to purchase from a local reputable camera store . 
but after num_num different games and num_num different discs i had enough . 
buy this if you have no other choice in my opinion . 
there was no power surge or other electrical issue ,  nothing . 
the slightly raised edges feel like they will protect the phone a bit . 
the arms roll up on your shoulders . not made for human use . 
pros : connection is simplefits welllight weightgood battery lifecons : cracking voicelow range . 
unfortunately ,  it hasn t really lived up to its price tag . 
record images and sounds to the same degree of fidelity as the num_extend
i picked up this dvd player from sears in march num_num for about num_extend
my problem is that it does not fit the phone . 
so it s something to do with the game . 
it is on now  ,  but i will not recommend this product . 
not so ,  my dog had it completely shredded in about num_num minutes . 
was looking forward to using the case with my phone . 
unfortunately the cat that needs these treats doesn t like it . 
she put me on hold for over an hour . 
there s no more depth to it than that . 
the blade is not sharp to the touch . 
consider all the reviewed before you shell out big bucks for this product . 
not worse than the magenta and aquamarin yasmin ,  though . 
easily one of the two worst games i ve ever played . 
i assumed the name num_extend cup coffee press  would produce three cups . 
it sticks to your hands after handling the bottle . 
this item is very overpriced for what it is . 
she immediately tries to climb out and up my chest . 
we re tossing the shirts and never buying fotl again . 
i recommend using well rested for undereyes and red spots instead of this . 
maybe num_num month isn t long enough to see results . 
i will go back to my hard case least it fits . 
company coming ,  need to make dessert ahead of time . 
i have nothing bad to say about it . 
it could have been great ,  but is disappointment . 
weapons are pathetic ,  movement is akward ,  and aiming is purely painful . 
i have also outdriven the draw distance on this twice . 
bounces over short grass and little bumps very nicely . 
would not recommend unless you have lots of patience and help . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
what good is the nice smelling cologne if it has no longevity . 
the dialogue in the game is rather good imo . 
however ,  mine broke just shy of two months after i bought it . 
all this ,  despite there being two huge litter boxes down there . 
it had a bitter almost chemical aftertaste that i could not ignore . 
i did like the color of this cap . 
i also love that i can make my own characters for the game . 
i do believe that this shoe isn t what it used to be . 
later i purchased an fm wireless transmitter that plays through the radio . 
i ordered this product based on the carol s daughter hype . 
spend a little extra and get a good cable . 
i will keep it only because it is a pain to return . 
this makes me not want to pay for prime any longer . 
this lens got stuck on my canon num_extend
they also have a lower cut ,  both in the front and back . 
i does not grind anywhere near fine enough for expresso . 
i have litter all over my floor around the carpet . 
her idle animation is a thing of beauty . 
my adult german shepherd destroys things quickly as all gsd like to do . 
well ,  that would be the clear springs fragrance . 
the dark chocolate truffle flavor overpowers the coffee flavor . 
i got this game the first day it came out . 
cheap and it broke after a couple uses . 
she still ate pretty fast ,  but it slowed her down some . 
it might be perfect for someone ,  but not me . 
the only time i smell anything is before she covers it up . 
i find this very frustrating as well that we cannot be represented appropriately . 
when i first purchased this product i was pleased . 
what s the deal with american buyers ?  how about this . 
it is really bad in closed places ,  like my car . 
the edges can also cut you if you aren t careful while cleaning . 
my son uses it as a sleepwear rather than an underwear . 
i have heard the recent hype of  stevia  and thought it was interesting . 
it is very loose and comes unattached frequently . 
the bottle should never be covered up like that . 
i gave it num_num stars for the color and material . 
the bar was barely a trickle and the chest hardly ever moved . 
it seems all successfull concerns eventually succumb to mediocrity . 
i purchased four of these bowls and do not use them . 
waiting for ups to pick it up for a return . 
very disappointing as i am usually a fan of maybelline . 
wife and i have identical num_extend and like  em a lot . 
then without moving the gun adjust your scope to match . 
the product does not have the same consistency as the real biosilk . 
get mystery of the abbey by days of wonder . 
i bought the batteries based on price but i have been disappointed . 
the silver one i ordered also wasn t the full silver leather . 
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it . 
i will give them a call on monday morning . 
they are also down any future expansions that they might put out . 
i made sure the tub was bone dry . 
there have been nation wide recalls in num_extend num_extend num_num and num_extend
the glitch that made it impossible for me to continue playing . 
after using this product for several months i have a few gripes . 
sometimes the mouse would just freeze for several seconds . 
don t get stuck with games like this ,  num_extend
not sure if my unit was defective or just a horrible product . 
seems more like a $ toy than a $ tool . 
if you re using it for fun at home ,  take your chances . 
passes are about half and half for reaching their target . 
you can also play with a total of num_num people . 
sometimes when i clicked the right mouse button ,  i pressed the edge . 
i also didn t notice much of the bay rum smell when shaving . 
now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless . 
i love the shoe and the feel and fit . 
it does not charge with any of them . 
stick with the pink lemonade or acai berry . 
i never really got to give this product a fair trial . 
i figured they all had the same footprint . 
you can turn the digital zoom off num_extend
so ideally miso should receive only half a cup of this food daily . 
all num_num protectors had to be disposed of . 
this is also the first return to amazon because it does not perform . 
my num_num month old son loves this trike . 
inserted new batteries and it didn t even turn on . 
however ,  this does not adequately moisturize my skin . 
it just doesn t work for my skin or lifestyle . 
canon usa claims that canon slrs should not be used with triggers above num_extend
the factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle . 
the only good thing about this game was the battles . 
i m sticking with red barn in the future . 
so like others i bought these without reading the reviews . 
the manufacturer should have put num_num more cents into making a better bottle . 
in fact there ishardly any taste at all . 
nice strong fabric ,  but is stiff as a board . 
this part is not useful in any way . 
there are traps that work ,  this just in not one of those . 
being old school i thought a cup was num_num ounces . 
just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it . 
makes me wonder if the metal is safe for food . 
these unfortunately do not cut well at all . 
it flopped left and right with every turn . 
it makes my scalp itch after a shampoo . 
now he must collect num_num forest orbs to lift the curse . 
the second signal is delayed and conflicts with the first . 
unfortunately i will downgrade my rating until they do . 
the super hyper spirit bomb usually killed one hit . 
i wouldn t have bought it if i knew that . 
now there always seems to be one path for our blue hero . 
cheaply constructed and designed with no thought to ergonomics . 
the bottom of my cakes get too greasy and stick to the pan . 
i don t wear this and let music just go . 
it s the chance you take when ordering online ,  but good lord . 
we could not use them at all and we both tried . 
i wanted it to hold my iphone in the car . 
the sinister backstory behind its  release is another review upon itself . 
i have been suffering from a broken gui within the router  at num_extend
i wear a num_num num_extend shoe when available . 
it s a total loss as far as i can see . 
nba live has all kinds of season and career options . 
the hold is pretty high ,  so that s nice . 
looks like i am still not my hunt for a gel silver chrome . 
also ,  he s able to slip out of it fairly easily . 
i couldn t even find the nr version on the eye envy website . 
i can get some of the hairs out by using hot water . 
it does in fact trap litter ,  though not all of it . 
it arrived in a plain envelope ,  completely smashed . 
i have used this off and on since num_extend
made me really sick until it all came out . 
the remaining portion of the food has now hit the trash can . 
the blue part that covers the ball pops off so easily . 
the towels leave behind lint when cleaning glass and mirrors . 
i do like the size because it is small . 
this is very cute but way too small even for a yorkie puppy . 
this card scored very poorly in the ratings of other cards . 
the one i sent back was a very solid yellow . 
it is a riveted together and stamped steel piece of crap . 
i do not recommend doing business with this seller . 
tried it and got the smoothest shave i ve ever had . 
i had one melt in the microwave too . 
it also looked kinda silly because it is small . 
another week passed with no sign of grass . 
plus using the spray made my whole room smell like urine . 
the spraying of citronella was over powering for my dog whenever he barked . 
for me ,  it was the second time i used it . 
the height of the cup was too short for effective mixing . 
i dont recall anything even close to this scratchy ,  unraveled style . 
i like sony brand headphone sound and own several . 
it doesn t work smoothly like a chaise lounge chair . 
which brings me to the next issue with dead rising . 
unless you re on a lake they are pretty much useless . 
wish it would have lived up to the hype !  . 
as soon as my hair dried it became a course kinky texture again . 
that one also had exactly the same effects . 
i normally love asics ,  i have probably num_num pairs . 
my mom s ragdoll cat enjoys it very much . 
i also give them one small can of wet food in the afternoon . 
i have a customer with three num_extend printers that used these num_extend cards . 
the dog toy was not safe for my low level energy shih tzu . 
occasionally it will just die ,  and require a hard boot . 
i simply couldn t trust it to produce usable images . 
i think there may be a production problem with the brown color . 
i purchased this product based on a cnet recommendation . 
everyone reacts differently ,  and this product made me break out . 
i first went to peet s in the year num_extend
i did not noticed a difference in mood and felt completely the same . 
the light costs about $ but never needs replacements bulbs or maintenance . 
the kids will like getting a scooby ring . 
i especially loved the smell which helped me sleep . 
they replied that they use the ppo method . 
however ,  it was extremely scratchy and irritated my skin in several places . 
i can t explain it but i don t like the results . 
it seemed like a good prank toy ,  so i went all in . 
i will never buy anything from this company again . 
there is no real replay value once you ve finished the game . 
they are in a bag but cost was about num_num percent lower . 
i tried using a controller but it was still bad . 
for the similar price range ,  i d recommend brunto echo instead . 
i can t describe it except that it s not real . 
pretty bad design for something that is supposed to stand up . 
i trusted the reviews that this hairspray is fabulous . 
my num_num system was just retired and faxing regularly . 
it takes up way too much space in a cabinet to be worthwhile . 
it also fit small even though i ordered num_num sizes up . 
very convenient as you use it like sugar . 
these bags are too flimsy and tear too easily . 
i ll go back to bison when this bag is gone . 
other than that its a great toy at a great price . 
the netgear started to drop the signal more often ,  which required restarting . 
not sure what is causing it but it s just slightly annoying . 
the graphics are ugly and resemble a cartoon . 
they both acted exactly alike by consistently locking up every few hours . 
so i contacted the folks at mangroomer for a replacement . 
it bunched in the corners because there was too much material . 
and when i wanted to quit ,  i decided to finish anyway . 
i stopped using them for hot liquids to no avail . 
mainly i avoid wearing them if possible and will look for a replacement . 
both units failed i m just over a year . 
the grommet on the front scratches my knife . 
then you swim to a lighthouse and take an elevator down . 
she just doesn t care for this interactive toy . 
although i never worried about that with the other brands . 
i have a htc radar windows based phone . 
they re easy and do what they re supposed to . 
i have no idea how the average users will set this up . 
i purchesed this item to go with the ati stock for my marlin num_extend
i mixed the perlite with soil as instructed . 
i used two and quit before cutting my face . 
i have not had any trouble with sticking . 
in retrospect ,  i can see she was right . 
wtf ?  that doesn t solve my problem ,  it makes it worse . 
she keeps getting a  weak battery  reading on the new batteries . 
they do help but they don t take much wear and tear . 
there are plenty of vegetable or synthetic protein products out there . 
tried cortisoze cream  this always should work  no effect . 
my past reefs have lasted at least num_num years if not num_extend
no way a num_num year old can build one to actually work . 
not for pets easily put off by smell . 
the flavor was somewhere in the middle of those two flavors . 
this is my biggest problem with the case . 
no joke ,  my dog is now a pooping machine . 
every morning ,  i would julienne carrots by hand . 
the main problem is that it will not tune to a frequency below num_extend
original review :  i agree with the previous reviewer . 
i used for treasure and i should have used for an art project . 
the ac adapter you get with it can be used without the dock . 
i never write reviews but wanted to help someone save their money . 
i think the size of it scared him then . 
the pans are great ,  they stack so nicely . 
they are just trying to make money off of junk . 
report samsung corrupt business practices to the ftc  federal trade commission  . 
bought this long time ago ,  didn t last long . 
update :  i have now used this case about a dozen times . 
any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop . 
except in that game ,  you could pick up anything you like . 
i would not justify this product to even have a star . 
so basically you just get a stuffed jar and num_num little squeakers . 
but holy cow ,  lay off on the sweetness . 
the linksys unit was well worth the extra num_num bucks . 
hood ,  i ordered it from the amazon marketplace . 
how can i review something that i have never ordered or received . 
i plain just don t like these fruit snacks . 
tried this and was lucky to be able to take it back . 
i started using the clarisonic brush and it felt great against my skin . 
 when playing in num_extend you don t notice it though .   . 
finally i got a return authorization after two days and several emails . 
more like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through . 
the dried edamame were indeed dry and not very flavorful . 
the case was so smooth that it was borderline slippery . 
so you better make sure you like it . 
players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs . 
totally the wrong shape ,  even though the size was correct . 
if i wanted to see cartoons ,  i d watch bugs bunny . 
but it is missing major standard features even after patching . 
but now my other son has a pair and we needed another topper . 
i tried % power for two minutes and only about num_num kernals popped . 
and remember ,  this is just the first part . 
i don t recommend it to anyone who s sensitive to smell . 
instead ,  we received just one wrist band in each color . 
there is nothing wrong with this bowl except for the price . 
was not marked clearly on sales page ,  does not fit my phone . 
immediately grab the mold and put in mouth . 
with your psp ,  you can hold about six songs . 
total waste of time and extra money ,  with no benefit to taste . 
note that i mostly saw this distortion by pixel peeping . 
i just cut off inch by inch as my hair grew . 
i use a kindle and an ipad to read while walking . 
thats right ,  you change your girl s clothes to gain abilities . 
in may num_extend it was hard green chunks ,  blue s response . 
seems like a small thing but it gets annoying . 
if you want to give someone a hate gift ,  i recommend this . 
i just don t know who would be looking for these . 
the door is flimsy and it will break . 
they acted like they were afraid of them . 
just like shoes ,  quality counts more than quantity . 
and these just don t have rigidity to clean there very well . 
he loved the feel and the convenience but couldn t handle the stink . 
i bought this based on most of the other reviews . 
but they do that with the lid from the milk carton . 
not so with this one ,  it s very weak in this regard . 
i always enjoyed playing mousetrap as a kid . 
and for the price i decided this wasn t the product for me . 
there s no padding whatsoever on the framework over the head . 
better luck to the next person who orders these . 
this is the one thing that dropped the entire rating . 
be careful if you decide to use this . 
back it off a bit and now it is in focus . 
make the rotating electric brush again interplak !  !  !  please !  !  . 
it was in pieces literally within num_num minutes of opening the package . 
wacoal does not make bras in my size num_extend uk  . 
one thing they are not is abrasion resistant . 
it has a strong ginger flavor ,  which i do not like . 
i tried it four times with no luck . 
num_extend is the only one it will work on . 
this has an energy formula incorporated into the multi . 
usable for everything from cooking times to an alarm clock . 
much better off with a good water filter and pills . 
amazon was great about getting me my refund right away . 
it is the same thing as tobacco withdrawl ,  expect virtual . 
it was cheap but the clip broke in less than a week . 
too much time is involved and the results are not impressive . 
i waited and waited and waited some more . 
as mario ,  you move from planet to planet as levels . 
pry them apart and see ,  as i did . 
this is an oil blend with a little kukui oil added . 
this game could have been fantastically suspenseful if not for the horrible controls . 
smooth is one thing ,  but this coffee has no taste . 
maybe they assumed i was a sissy for ordering the turkey sticks . 
i bought this to catch squirrels ,  as it says it does . 
its like the sims ,  but trying to hard . 
dissapointing for me so beware if you re buying them for travel . 
major disappointment !  if you have a gamecube get mario party num_extend
once again this is a game that should rented and not purchased . 
i bought a new point and shoot and needed a new case . 
it s really like the powder doesn t fully dissolve in the milk . 
the adapter doesn t work with any of the new mac systems . 
guess you can t return a half used bar of tar . 
right away it burned my eyes so that was not pleasant . 
it s impossible to understand and not a single sentence makes any num_extend
it goes on to  added color   yellow num_extend blue num_extend yellow num_extend red num_extend
not big and lovable like tickle me elmo . 
the harness rubbed ,  burned and cut the underarm of my dog . 
water quality and clarity are the same with or without . 
takes the player all the way to the title screen . 
there is hardly any cushion and it doesn t cut out any noise . 
i owned a drinkwell original pet fountain for years and it needed replaced . 
in the office we have the typical array of other electronic devices . 
saw reviews that said this is an ongoing problem . 
the first time that amazon did this to me . 
it is very difficult to see even with the lights on . 
the strap in the back also rubbed into my heel . 
they seem to be well made and are true to weight . 
the yohimbe extract is a different beast altogether . 
i m just wondering how long they are going to last . 
i ended up buying the book diner talk and it was much better . 
it comes with attachments ,  but they do not work . 
update :  i now have two more flashlights ruined by leaking rayovac batteries . 
i know it was this since they had nothing else new . 
i used to get these ,  but they were much thinner . 
otherwise ,  it s a good boost for your work out . 
sending the kcups back was not an option as it is too expensive . 
now i can t reliably find the stop and start points . 
its so surprising that this product is worse than my handmade dipole antenna . 
i have a num_extend year old and a num_extend year old . 
only six months into occasional use ,  ours started to peel badly . 
the crest feels flimsily glued on and is itself stiff and cheesy looking . 
the belt strap broke and now it is useless . 
the game is played in a  stop and go  method . 
it s shiny and does not get absorbed quickly . 
the voice acting is about the only bright spot . 
these screen protectors were not the exact match for the samsung galaxy s . 
this cable was very affordable ,  but you get what you pay for . 
gut when they came out with this monster it was hit and miss . 
i am a lipstick diva and have tried them all . 
item arrived completely crumpled up in the bag and clearly used before . 
the specifics of my case are not really relevant to this discussion . 
come time papa deer comes out ,  it refused to turn on . 
this product does absolutely nothing for makeup on young skin under num_extend
especially if you have a ton of expansions . 
they are worth the extra money ,  by far . 
i threw it in marinade and all into the dish i was making . 
they said to use denture tablets and i think lemon to clean it . 
problem is ,  it doesn t fit well ,  not flush . 
in the menu there is an option to save ,  load and password . 
this is one of the least appealing snes fighting games i ve played . 
did not care for how granular this seemed to be . 
this battery is priced well ,  came quickly ,  and works fine . 
i have a media device that plays and stops . 
studies about triethanolamine ,  already show  moderate  cancer link . 
this works great together with chicken for and easy meal . 
locks up everytime i put a memory card in it . 
it is edgy ,  but not in a good way . 
honestly ,  another num_num feet isn t worth the price . 
i m horrified that it seems to have gathered so many good reviews . 
i thought i d try it because it s so convenient . 
makes typing awkward and the cover looks weird on the keyboard . 
i am not sure why the packages are all so different . 
it s probably my own fault for falling for it . 
just spend your money on an oem one . 
most energy drinks give you buzz with high caffeine and sugar contents . 
there s really no other way to sugar coat it . 
don t get me wrong ,  these are very nice speaker stands . 
i am a wrangler jean s fan for many years . 
in my case that was a good thing . 
this is the worst samsung products i have ever used . 
my first loaf was gummy on the inside and quite heavy . 
suddenly i had a need for a wireless print server . 
however ,  after a while i just didn t care any longer . 
they hit your house ,  your deck ,  your easter dress . 
there was only one review available on this product when i ordered it . 
when i called the manufacturer about this they were almost rude . 
i usually enjoy a pumpkin coffee in the autumn months . 
libby s used to be a name i trust . 
the flavor reminds me of the smell of a sweaty steam sauna . 
it does charge my sansa num_extend player however . 
if i can t resolve this problem i will likely find another router . 
i am angry  ,  i usually am not . 
i recently replaced one part for $ shipped . 
i purchased the item in august ,  and liked it . 
on the iphone num_extend the num_extend the issue is simple . 
i bought this for my six year old for his birthday . 
i should have bought a better pump to start . 
horrific . the world itself is gorgeous though very constrained . 
these are thinner that most kitchen garbage bags . 
i suddenly found myself having intense itching as well . 
save your money and get a more expensive aeg . 
i found them all to be really gross ,  particularly the raspberry . 
i fully charged it ,  and the mpow just stopped working . 
i was very disappointed that it just didn t work . 
but they are also rock hard and caustic . 
also ,  the sound quality is muffled and is not stereo quality . 
they are entirely too short to do any such thing . 
it is fairly sticky though and doesn t last very long . 
most seem to help some ,  but not enough . 
i completed halo on the xbox in normal and heroic mode . 
if you are a sim racer then nascar num_num is not for you . 
someone else  maybe  returned them and then they were sent to me . 
i am typically a num_extend in nylons but had trouble pulling these up . 
it smelled really good ,  and i liked the texture . 
this product is not much like peanut butter or chocolate . 
so this one was inexpensive and had good reviews so i bought it . 
i was playing and came upon a mission entitled ,   arnhem knights  . 
took it out of the package and it immediately worked . 
apologies to my coworkers who had to finish the box for me !  . 
not dependable or guaranteed to work every time you turn it on . 
i returned them and i do not recommend product to anyone . 
i am looking into buying a larger cat condo tree instead . 
the screen was on and none of the buttons worked anymore . 
i live on acreage where there are all kinds of grasses and weeds . 
unfortunately this was poorly designedand wouldn t fit three counter tops i tried . 
i am only num_num lbs ,  so it isn t a weight issue . 
i got about num_num square feet done and had about num_extend
i bought oxo wires to replace the wire that will soon break . 
go to the nearest hardware store and buy a small camping shovel . 
the new one has a narrower pour spout . 
this is not the first time this has happened with your cases . 
i have to keep reaching down and adjusting . 
it s not one of the original melt cases . 
never got it to run on my computer . 
i agree with the reviewer who noted that the plastic is weak . 
make no difference in a couple of spots i have on my hands . 
unfortunately the grapeseed extract is causing me problems . 
i ve had this product for about num_num months now . 
i prefer the digital because it s unclear when the test is complete . 
for every half decent gambling related game that comes out  i . e . 
they do the job and didn t cost that much . 
i just bought this toy today and i m returning it tomorrow . 
there are alternatives out there that do both . 
this stuff has a bad texture ,  bad smell ,  and tastes awful . 
i m what you would call a veteran gamer . 
this is a comfortable and inexpensive shoe ,  but the price really shows . 
i have have revised my review of this product . 
it sucks !  i got this razor because of the good reviews . 
maybe it wouldmake a difference on your nails . 
it s fun for a few days and then it gets boring . 
my laptop went from a smoldering high num_extend to as low as num_extend
we have tried rescanning many times and no change . 
the graphics are nice which they should be . 
she is a great dog except for this . 
i should have sent this back as soon as it arrived . 
no dog bowl ,  vitamin can ,  can of food ,  nor bone . 
great mirror in every way except for the convex mirror . 
these could easily become splinters in their little fingers . 
it sounds like a cheap radio because that s what it is . 
they enjoy cuddles but draw the line with oil on them . 
switched back to my hard plastic case and had no issues since . 
bought the kit hoping to get good results . 
there is a high price attached to this thing . 
but i hate wasting stuff so i stuck it through . 
amazon should also be more careful checking the items before they ship . 
this unit works very well for steam output . 
i never had this problem with the tablet formulation by nature s life . 
they were itchy and the ruffle band would not stay down or up . 
sadly this tastes like any other artificial sweetener . 
it was silver ,  which i could have purchased locally . 
i bought this based on the reviews of others . 
i don t want to poison my family or my dog . 
the price was right so i ordered up . 
tossed it after trying it for a couple of days . 
i don t taste anything different from other coffee s . 
thus here i am writing a review today . 
it does not read dvds but read cd . 
i would not be very happy or very healthy if i did . 
i purchased these a while back and at first they were fine . 
the waterfall took me two nights ,  that was the hardest . 
it was not fixable ,  the holder for the band cracked right off . 
as i said ,  doesn t seem to help me . 
this one broke from that tradition and proceeded to be just plain awful . 
it is definitely a pain relieving tool for me . 
if you want a smaller area ,  fold the blanket . 
the set had no storage box nor stand . 
the other i can say at least most people should be okay with . 
i have not contacted the vendor yet because i am so disgusted . 
and i don t even have that much hard cleaning to do . 
when you go in the sun ,  you cant see anything . 
the aiwas had quit on me within a few months . 
i picked it up along with some other boxes . 
will not order any more of these products . 
opened it up to expect the battery connection . 
so for me it s really only one usable port . 
so we ended up tossing most of the set as parts were lost . 
i was very excited when i came across these shoes . 
both units have  stage num_num clean power  which i assumed meant rf filtering . 
ive used a lot of this with my pigs . 
it s a brighter red so with the glitter it s too flashy . 
i had it for only num_num days and i returned it . 
i would never purchase this type item again !  . 
i received the product yesterday and wore them today . 
i use in cooking and also in a few hot beverages . 
i had to use about twice that much with this new formula . 
there s no fluent movement or grace in the fighting . 
requested a replacement from amazon in case i got a bad unit . 
it seemed to be both responsive and accurate . 
i really have not found it to be a big problem . 
this procter does not stick on my device can i have a refund . 
it seems camco parts don t necessarily fit each other . 
i wore makeup again and didn t have any reaction . 
the oven is less than what you pay for . 
i tried to change over to the new wallet and just gave up . 
they were no where near one another to latch . 
what voice acting there is isn t so bad . 
this doesn t even keep it in place num_num seconds . 
wouldn t recommend there are better tools out there on amazon . 
i purchased this and have used it for a couple of weeks now . 
this unit seemed to fit all the specifications for what i wanted . 
i put it back on and left it . 
three curls in and i decided i hated the thing . 
i bought these for my wife ,  after becoming an obsessed native customer . 
played it once ,  then never played it again . 
i guarantee it is nothing like fs num_extend
i don t much care for this stash premium loose green tea . 
i would not recomend this for support ,  its not really supportive . 
it s definitely not for all nose sizes ,  definitely not mine . 
it was also always too small for the cats to lie on . 
perhaps this seat is designed for those a bit heavier than i ?  . 
but somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around num_num days of use . 
in addition ,  the packaging is really cheap and small for the price . 
if that s what you want ,  don t buy this . 
i must say it looks great but didn t work as advertised . 
heavy cable that i use to hook up my laptop to a hdtv . 
the price is very attractive and most of the reviews were positive . 
the plastic catch is cheap and doesn t really do its job . 
the craftsmanship is good and i definitely like the way they look . 
they hit at the most uncomfortable spot imaginable . 
there are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out . 
does not work  and believe me i tried every which way  . 
my fiance has taken to holding the bluetooth up to his face . 
the main downside is a slight sour aftertaste . 
infact ,  it s a cool gadget for heart rate fans . 
this dress feels more like a costume than a real outfit . 
i have these hooked up to a video projector . 
phone also fits a little too snug in the pouch . 
i ll be looking for a better quality ,  more reliable router . 
i used this product for several months since i bought it . 
my cats don t like this item they prefer halo chicken dried treats . 
however ,  the tripod comes with a good warranty . 
i was unable to press out any cookies . 
the kid knows what s comin  ,  just like nowadays in present society . 
i ve used this brand of foot cream with no ill effects . 
it also always looks like it has moisture under the back . 
however ,  the flavor of this one was weird . 
previously ,  the tea was neither muddy in taste or in appearance . 
all the crystal light products are sweetened with aspartame  nutrasweet ,  equal  . 
maybe i might give it as a gift or try to resell it . 
a product should never beep unless there is something wrong with it . 
i had finally found a food processor that i could easily afford . 
the controller worked great for a very long time . 
there does not seem to be any replacement parts for this unit . 
mind you my daughter weighs in at num_extend
i didn t find any features that make them particularly notable . 
just keeps humming and the wheel barely moves that dispenses the food . 
the specs and reviews and my research impressed me the most . 
the comments made by friend and foe are repetitive . 
i might instead disassemble it and shorten the brass hex head . 
it s not special because is made in usa . 
i called customer service and they were horrible . 
i have been usingprecious cat kitten attract kitten training litterfor my kitten . 
got a second guy whose phone did now work well . 
online play is just about the only way to make this game interesting . 
i used cream cheese ,  crackers ,  and the sauce . 
i like a little sweetness ,  but this is too much . 
i found that the rounds tend to slip out . 
this was the latest software available as of july num_extend num_extend
i bought this to hang around the house when company comes over . 
i tried to find a reason to leave the house . 
costing me money and time and worries about data num_extend
it has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday . 
and still do not have the card working . 
version b fixes a number of problems that version a had with certain num_extend
avoid this unless you don t care about a short life span . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
i was looking foward to this game and it was a flop . 
my num_extend year old daughter got this last xmas . 
this case fit my droid num_num global perfectly . 
the player that goes first tends to win . 
when you start with nothing you have nothing to lose . 
i love classic wooden toys and thought this would be great . 
it made everything look blurry on the phone . 
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison . 
if you are into games like ffvii then this is your game . 
i am not able to use these as i had intended . 
this unit barely charges anything and is all but worthless . 
i like it for its heavy weight and professional look . 
it would cost more to fix it than i paid for it . 
the more of this you use ,  the chemical flavor seems to compound . 
the product used to be the tops ,  not anymore . 
you get what you pay for i suppose . 
i believe i may have had an old bottle because it smelled cheap . 
it s not as nice when you get it as the picture . 
this iron received thumbs up from the consumer testing world . 
the only one that worked was seachem clarity . 
also drawstring is much smaller ,  more like a shoelace . 
num_extend unit didn t work at num_extend unit sounded very muddy and unclear . 
it may even be as heavy as my camera . 
i have only had this for about two weeks . 
do yourself a favor and keep looking elsewhere . 
but then after a couple of months ,  the steamer stopped steaming . 
it was hard to put on and remove . 
i am allll for inexpensive products ,  but this one isnt it . 
the charger couldn t give % at most times . 
i really liked this screen for the first week i had it . 
the adjustable eyepiece ran out of adjustment for my num_extend
i guess i expected a $ vac to last longer than three months . 
with that said ,  i like the built in num_extend memory . 
this is unwearable ,  and too bad because otherwise the fit was good . 
i wouldn t bother mentioning graphics unless they were remarkable in some way . 
the oster is truly one of the best looking toasters on the market . 
there s no way this product will last that long . 
i stopped using the product and i wasn t breaking out . 
therefore ,  this thing isn t really as useful as it might appear . 
the original controller s cord is also terribly short . 
i had to wash it off before leaving the house . 
places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should . 
the description of this product clearly states that it is an unlocked phone . 
i also though the nutritional content left much to be desired . 
the title of my review says it all . 
as excited as one could be that is . 
nylabone seems to be having an issue with product quality . 
after the first complete charge ,  it died after one phone call . 
but i came to the page to buy one of these . 
it was an awful first experience for a home wireless network . 
the leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness . 
that is all i can say about the product for now . 
to the contrary ,  this was treated with great care . 
the finish on the blade is susceptible to acids . 
looks like good ingredients but neither of my cats will touch it . 
there s no echo or anything ,  they just sound off . 
i am almost out of this product and nothing has really improved . 
i will not be using them next month . 
there was a whole slew of problems i had while playing oblivion . 
this thing for the adults and the kids is like a painful nightmare . 
it came yesterday and will not even fit the phone . 
and its not the same color blue as the picture . 
crayola is a good brand but they missed on this product . 
anyone who has a toddler knows that is an accident waiting to happen . 
i looked at the ingredients and immediately understood why . 
i had a hard time trying to figure out how it worked . 
i do not recommend this product at all . 
while this one looks nice ,  it lacks serious innovation . 
but i ve tried with and without the foundation . 
keep the directors and actors ,  fire the game developing team . 
i like jlo but this fragrance is just discusting . 
you just slow down for something like a tenth of a second . 
i don t know who finds these things comfortable . 
this charger only works with iphones ,  not for ipads . 
instead of helping i actually woke up with headaches every single day . 
amazon does not carry one that is large enough to surround this grill . 
i read the simple instructions multiple times just to get it right . 
i tried loading for num_num minutes and followed the directions exactly . 
i bought this tire gauge a a little over two months ago . 
i am using the meat cleavers on daily bases . 
the water sounds are nicer ,  but my plants don t prefer them . 
he used the hollow arm to his advantage and broke that ridge . 
the pure organic wild blueberry raw fruit and nut bar is surprisingly bland . 
this is unacceptable for the price point of this flat iron . 
the maps were outdated and in september garmin offered new maps for $
the second broke about num_extend months after i bought it . 
i should have opted for a better device . 
they do seem to come apart and ball up a bit . 
first of all ,  it did not protect my screen . 
this is the most disappointing product i have ever seen . 
i read the reviews and took a chance . 
this kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening . 
i think i ll try the  professional  model and see if it lasts . 
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking . 
i put a rug under it and that helps . 
besides ,  shooting people is dangerous as it brings heat . 
i will not buy again ,  and the search continues . 
the product itself is great ,  but the sprayer does not . 
don t waste your money !  it gets dirty very fast . 
it is only slightly sweet ,  and has a hint of medicinal quality . 
he smells it ,  took a bite then started barking at his bowl . 
i know a lot of people like this product . 
so the assumption was a big enough box would help with the issue . 
needed phone to charge on a trip and it wasn t working . 
i don t particularly care for the annoying sounds link makes though . 
they lasted me several months and sounded great . 
when i plugged it into my camcorder it did not work . 
favorites for us were the truffles and the chocolate covered pretzels . 
i bought a much larger one and it works better than this one . 
that shower literally has not been used for num_num months . 
i should have spend a little more money . 
this is not . i genuinely applaud hasbro for making the attempt . 
this product is very sweet ,  it has glycerin in it . 
it just did not blend like other sweeteners i tried . 
they have earned the title of delivering the most elite fighting games ever . 
made one of my cats very itchy and constipated too . 
mashed the button a few times ,  and got the desultory chirp . 
looks like my neutrogena days are truly over . 
i had to replace the battery and couldn t get the cover off . 
its tekken force that you have to play to unlock story mode . 
the response :   we cannot accept a credit card to top up time . 
after all i like the origional one i just got . 
based on my experience ,  i can recommend lodge or lecruest . 
even leaving this plugged in seems to raise the danger level num_extend
lots of alcohol in it ,  smells like ammonia  ,  not greasy . 
the foam crumbled and deposited grit all over my face  and bed  . 
oh ,  i decide now to turn off the wifi on my smartphone . 
perhaps we should check at local retailers for label information . 
i think there are safer and more fun toys out there than these . 
big crunchy seed cubes with a touch of sweet . 
both the bat symbols fell off just taking it out of the box . 
i live in the seattle area ,  not  way out there  . 
i wanted it to smell of coconut lotion !  will not purchase again . 
still usable but not good quality at all . 
i use hairspray and it does not remove it . 
do not waste your money on this item . 
unfortunately the product does not keep skunks at bay as promised . 
secondly ,  they are too heavy to not have flexibility . 
purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots . 
my son got this as a gift for his num_extend birthday . 
unfortunately every time i tried to print a document there was an error . 
you can buy any cleaner solution you like . 
i think they tried to do too much here . 
value is okay if you don t mind doing dishes at work . 
but the sim adapter not works at all . 
the game is just not well done at all . 
it is hard to lay on if you are using it on yourself . 
after i dried my hair my hair smelled like i had been outside . 
i cant even given them away nor can i return them . 
what ?  you can t find the starting point num_extend awful navigation . 
you can find the code information on any company website . 
i think i will stick with that from now on . 
bought these in september of num_num thinking i got a good deal . 
plus i lose a lot of batter out the bottom . 
i bought this drive in the winter and my house is pretty dry . 
they need to check out what works with what . 
i just didn t get the same results as the num_num star reviews . 
i really find it hard to live without a num_extend cd player . 
when i stop using it ,  my weight goes back down .

i use to use the beef gravy one . 
i spread areas where i have a bee problem and did nothing . 
then ,  it kinked the hose and cut off the water . 
i ve always enjoyed capcom s method of making difficult games . 
the charitable description would be that they re impossibly hard . 
in the end i took them out of service . 
you can t turn your head ,  you must turn the entire body . 
and you get to do this for five separate characters . 
upset i couldn t install the seat on my num_extend schwinn coffee bike . 
i m not really even sure why they would have liked it . 
always the leader ,  can t ever be a grunt . 
believe me ,  you do not want this on your lashes . 
after blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell . 
but the colors are pretty and the matte finish is beauty . 
we bought this coffeemaker to replace our mr . 
i have been using this product for a month now . 
very disappointed as i was looking forward to this product . 
it needs a camera with the motor in the camera . 
i have never received an article of clothing that smells this horrible . 
not worth the return shipping cost for a refund . 
now ,  that being said ,  these tubes have been fine so far . 
lastly the handle does not move up and down smoothly . 
this is far easier than tying your shoes . 
got it misaligned once and couldn t unlatch it . 
the effort required to get to num_num psi is ridiculous . 
anyway ,  one will keep on falling and falling .  .  . etc . 
had it only cost me $ i would have been ok with it . 
my one cat eats anything but she does not like these . 
i think tiffen never presents this type of problem .

my baby has never suffered like this before and hopefully never again . 
a few more  bends  and it will crack . 
i do not have abnormal or huge feet; it s the shoes !  . 
this is cheap and i think it s only somewhat effective . 
this is a great tool for swimming and any water activity . 
i wish i had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game . 
the manufactures warranty for the motor is one year . 
for medium to fine hair ,  a single twist is usually sufficient . 
the little chrome handle fell off the first time i used it . 
very slight pushing on this and you can see it moving . 
these games were among defining for their time . 
maybe a dvd of people doing it would help . 
i picked up one of these recently at a discount store . 
you can only eat a few before you feel a bit sick . 
you basically hold a and flick your wrist . 
the handle fell off the first day and got lost . 
the tool is pretty much pointless ,  and not what expected at all . 
i foolishly bought three of them because it was such a great price . 
they are best used in asian type dishes . 
my first reaction to the smell was that it smelled like dirt . 
i m afraid i didn t like this set of cookware . 
it seems like it would work well ,  but it just doesn t . 
low level plantronics bluetooth with very few features . 
it kept falling off and i just put it away and stop trying . 
it cakes up quickly and it doesn t set my face at all . 
the game claims to be for ages num_num and up . 
the problem is that it does not remain fully charged very long . 
that made me question if i should still be using the product . 
wasted my money thank u very much !  sigh . 
chewier than i would have liked ,  but the flavor was acceptable . 
i need it to make my coffee perfectly ,  consistantly . 
even the graphics engine is still the same . 
just not the quality i was hoping for . 
what are amazon . com buyers thinking selling this crap ?  . 
aunt thought that the people shown on the box came with the camper . 
this review for deep facial cleanser for sensitive skin . 
i got annoyed al the time when i wear it . 
this case doesn t fit my galaxy at all . 
they make more noise the a freight train . 
i noticed no health effects after taking it a while . 
therefore ,  they took the old version and stripped it down . 
using anise in licorice is not a trade secret . 
this is basically a small rake ,  its crap . 
in the meantime ,  i would not trust their products . 
the facial graphics arent the best but overall its very good . 
if you want a real good one ,  don t get this . 
the shaver is in fact a pretty decent design . 
plastic material ,  the strap is not very num_extend
several times we got questions that no one knew what the answer was . 
you don t ever do that to cast iron . 
but it is too late to return it . 
a small would have been to tight so i do not use these . 
pissed that i don t have wireless internet right now . 
i returned it and got a swift refund . 
i ve had this stylus for a few months . 
that s important especially if you have a big cat . 
there are only num_num character classes you can choose from . 
just drop the probe in it and close the fridge on the cable . 
i ordered this unit on may num_num of this year num_extend
not the end of the world ,  but definitely a crappy case . 
i tried multiple times and it just never really was that great . 
it tips over very easily when they pick up their feet to push . 
in comparison ,  i prefer even folgers to this product . 
then one morning ,  the head broke right off . 
using the reset switch was of no effect . 
i m very disappointed ,  and so will you be . 
then i made the coffee in my gevalia coffee maker . 
some buildings are worth num_num block ,  num_num blocks or more . 
i showed her the keys and i undid the lock for her . 
well ,  after setting things to be plugged in .

the usb is too loose when i plug in the cable . 
i m buying a traditional wire wheel to replace it . 
gft hard soaps smell great but don t lather reliably at all . 
the wood base seems to be made of a wood that absorbes things . 
if you are looking for that ,  keep looking . 
the picture quality at the beginning was outstanding . 
however it did have a loud aroma that did not smell so pleasant . 
i purchased this product because of this $ equipment warranty . 
but do not worry if it does not . 
nothing you can do to fix it except replace it . 
i really was surprised at how bad this stuff really was . 
the three channel heli teaches you some bad habits . 
sometimes he will give up and head for another box . 
in my opinion ,  it s better just to buy the regular kong . 
so it just doesn t have much zelda charm . 
one cat would chew on the string  bad !  not safe . 
now my review title is a  copy cat  title . 
horrible ,  horrible product quality ,  a waste of cash . 
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my num_extend
yes ,  actually the customer service was quite good . 
in all honesty this game just ins t very good . 
i had a mirror i loved from the sharper image . 
but they were heavier and felt soooooo much better in your hands . 
in the first num_num months we had it ,  it was great . 
exact order so i m surprised that these are so much longer . 
i had purchased a new computer barely num_num months ago . 
i have less of a problem with cheap mg oxide . 
this game is so bad it makes x look good . 
if you have a single computer ,  you should try it . 
i ordered this product thinking it would help my bad knee . 
amazon was extremely helpful in arranging a return . 
if you have disk brakes ,  this might not be the best option . 
for reference ,  i have tried the puck sumatran and the diedrich . 
on the snes in most platformers ,  b jumps and y attacks . 
instead i got a funky strong chemical smell . 
it s fine if you don t actually try to lift anything . 
why ?  because you inevitably throw them around in various ways . 
signal separation is very poor ,  even when listening to powerful local stations . 
he uses his nose to push it around and force the treats out . 
it just didn t do anything for my hair at all . 
because of this ,  i always ended up putting it on backwards . 
do you agree ?  i m not sure if i do . 
to me it had a very strong ,  too strong ,  chemical smell . 
that s the only reason i kept this case cover . 
secondly ,  this thing is a beast to get off . 
i pulled it out recently to use it and it no longer works . 
the only positive thing; the amazing graphics ,  that was it . 
and multiple enemies is exactly what you re up against . 
i bought this scale several months ago ,  and it worked okay . 
i thought i would try this brand of shirt . 
these prove that original designs are often not improved; only made different . 
i should have not been as cheap and gotten some nicer cotton ones . 
i purchased this fountain for my three cats to use . 
kairi or whatever turns to hate you because he wants your girl . 
on my larger scissors ,  it seemed to make gouges . 
i was really disappointed in my reaction but maybe you will like it . 
it installed quickly and effortless into windows xp pro . 
i can hear and the people i call can clearly hear me . 
my it guy had to saw it off . 
i try to be fair in my reviews . 
this camera will not work with dlink s latest mycloud access software . 
when it was working ,  it was real pain and fuel got everywhere . 
it tasted like instant coffee that you used to get at bk . 
once they get it ,  it could be a life long battle . 
the reset only works for one and switching between timers is a nightmare . 
series tricorder and a wrath of khan phaser . 
i will give it one thing ,  it has impressive graphics . 
i bought these for my dogs to prevent grass burns . 
not worth the risk of buying ,  in my opinion . 
i used this purchase as a test of  economical  filters . 
they certainly do not  lock on and pull out dirt  . 
brilliant idea mixing a super low ph substance in with water conditioner . 
if you want to soften your chair ,  look elsewhere . 
in fact the bose worked just as well without it . 
i should have bought a more expensive install kit !  . 
won t ever buy another one ,  nor recommend one to anyone else . 
num_num were very polite requests ,  the num_extend was hostile . 
the small is very small and the medium is just too big . 
i bought this kitchen for christmas ,  and i m very disappointed . 
this was an exact replacement for num_num i lost .

this time ,  the phone seems working with num_num bar signal strength .

i tried it with a case and without a case . 
what a great concept with a crummy execution . 
i bought these because of the over ear design . 
also ,  try to get some good influences in your life . 
half the features on the main menu simply don t function . 
you must then find num_num lilies ,  which takes another num_num minutes . 
after i rebooted i noticed the device drivers where there . 
i personaly say dont buy this unless your camping . 
but it does keep the phone s thickness to a minimum . 
i still had to use mascara after this . 
i don t love pvp  player versus player  action . 
this broke easy and the batteries don t last long . 
it is worth the extra expense to buy a solid wall unit charger . 
however this unbranded version does not work at all . 
i waited for months for my size to become available in this boot . 
based on that ,  i bought the gbc game . 
one washing cycle and the shirt shrank by almost num_num sizes . 
i would love them if they were sturdier . 
this game should have never been released in its current state . 
even though i was very careful the thin plastic broke while attempting this . 
i have been using this product since sept . 
so strong it will stink up your garments . 
it also smells great ,  without the sour smell .

they look like something from a nintendo num_num game . 
contacted them again regarding service and they said there are no service centers . 
different spices taste differently ,  originated differently and are different genetically . 
my three year old received this at her birthday party . 
you can get similarly cheaply made eggs from target for a lower price .

use your magnifying mirror and a strong light . 
this product was recommended to me for a damaged finger . 
i purchased this whisk and the flat version num_num years ago .

as soon as you turn or twist them even a little bit . 
i listen to them pretty loud  katy perry and such  .

i get the same results as the lights in the salon . 
good thing his teeth didn t make it through . 
a total waste of money !  do not buy !  . 
i tried to get them interested but no sorry they weren t interested . 
had it looked like the picture i may have kept them .

i purchased it to pair with my apple itouch and it worked nicely . 
the charging handle end broke off a couple weeks ago . 
i got tired of waiting for it to arrive . 
this game is a waste of time and money . 
castlevania fan or not ,  rent this one ,  don t buy it . 
now i have to take this product to have a bowel movement . 
i bought something else that was breathable cotton and more comfortable . 
it does not sit properly and provides too much resistance . 
my waist size is num_extend so i selected the size of num_extend
i will never understand the obsession with first person shooters . 
and the best part ,  my cats love it .

riding a horse for many missions certainly is a highlight of the game . 
things are hard to take apart for cleaning . 
the couscous had a great flavor but the beans were sooooo not cooked . 
i never wore these eye lashes because they look to fake . 
i ve worn this since it hit the market way back when . 
next thing i know ,  the house smells like burnt electronics .

this case for the galaxy note num_num is not great . 
i would love it if it would work . 
one wheel didn t always touch the ground without a load . 
i didn t like the out come at all . 
these are cheap and i suggest avoiding them . 
this year ,  they requested and received the new littlest pet shop lpsos . 
logic should tell them that i bought the unit . 
i took a chance and ordered two cables . 
save yourself some time and go with a better brand . 
so ,  i guess it was more my fault than the machine s .

the palm v and vx have a rechargeable lithium battery . 
fits a little too tight ,  well a lot too tight actually . 
for shoes that say made in the usa ,  i expected better craftmanship . 
it is not easy to read or follow . 
initially ,  i thought this was a good idea . 
this was not a good buy and i advise you don t . 
i love crisp ,  but this stuff goes way beyond that anymore . 
this used to work for me ,  but now it no longer works . 
it will write at num_extend speed only on select brand cdr like tdk . 
the blades have held up but the rubberized handles are banged up looking . 
being leather the case does stretch out a bit . 
sort of messed up this time . here s the thing . 
it must be great ,  from all the favorable reviews . 
you would thing that vine would ship these items more carefully . 
you really do get what you pay for . 
this drive lost over num_extend of data within one month . 
probably the most frustrating thing is the messed up experience system . 
it is as if they threw a bunch of comic book stories together . 
having to reboot the router after every change got annoying . 
this is because it sticks out so much from the handlebars . 
inflated both rings and the stopper would not stay in either ring . 
this toy is cute and that is about it . 
i didnt get what i was expecting to come . 
you have your standard hp ,  and you have lp .

i ve used it at christmas and various vacation trips . 
the cd player is very slim ,  which is a plus . 
the cats lay right on the area treated . 
bought one used by the seller :  electronics pro num_extend
it also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products . 
the material is really nice though and the color is great . 
luckily i got a small amount just to try . 
i especially love the ankle cuff and wear it up . 
the assembly seems loose but it gets no tighter . 
but the characters all are exagerated stereotypes with stupid names . 
the cats have been on the food since december . 
a little less neat but you have to wash you hands anyway . 
and it cannot be used while docked in the charger . 
so i said ya know ,  hey maybe it s not so bad . 
got a num_extend and am nothing but satisfied . 
i m a little surprised at the great reviews this game is receiving . 
i like that they are less sugary than the major u . s . 
i was very disappointed since i liked the size and shape . 
it  takes away the fun of playing the game . 
so ,  i am not sure what else people use this for . 
i should ve listened to all the reviews ,  but no not me . 
like i said for $ i wasn t expecting great quality . 
this case has absolutely no feel to the buttons . 
it is very very very bad cause sickness . 
sorry to say i didn t read the reviews here first !  !  . 
biggest problem is only some of them come with mounting clips . 
i think the  top down  view just didn t seem right to me .

the plastic is really light and feels like its going to fall apart . 
one died in the middle of me playing nba num_extend

same thing happened with the second one i bought . 
the toys in the beach set are also not very interesting . 
our num_num year old golden lab wants nothing to do with this food . 
we have had num_num of these in num_num years . 
and to operate the box ,  you have to turn it . 
it does everything the kameleon does and more ,  with less battery usage . 
it wasn t even decent as a back scratcher . 
kids love it but it becomes a big distractor . 
the airship that you wander around in is so big and confusing . 
i have made several attempts to download this onto my windows num_num laptop .

this has to be the worst game ever !  !  !  . 
the little head on the mower chomps very ,  very noisily when pushed . 
i have num_num more cans to go through . 
not true at all !  this game is nothing compared to ssx . 
it is just like a slow cooker and it is so small . 
today s grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring . 
it still has pretty strong smell for sensitive cream . 
however the corner seams opened up after a few months of use . 
thank goodness i got this on sale for $
the general level of animation and graphics is very good . 
we have switched to hipp organic which contains only safe ingredients for babies . 
my daughter dives for the real remote because of the lights . 
 its like hitting them with an axe  someone told me . 
okay the fan ran and the wands rotated . 
now i wish i could turn the clock back . 
pokemon diamond and pearl do have stuff ,  but it is incredibly boring . 
you don t want to remove facial hair this way . 
the flex sleeves don t seem to provide any sound isolation at all . 
there is absolutely no logic to them at all . 
so i m running around just trying to figure out who to shoot . 
they are dry as a bone and are exactly like eating compressed sawdust . 
the hook could have hit her in the eye . 
the extra $ more than pays for the num_extend book alone . 
what is going on with that ?  loosy goose comes to mind . 
fewest ingredients whose names i can t pronounce  as possible . 
this tea has a strong ,  artificial orange flavor . 
i returned that one too and gave up after that . 
mind you ,  the spice jars were not even close to full . 
but if a bunch of starving students can t stomach these bars . 
too canny a taste that made me stop eating it . 
my wife has the same case and hers has cracked twice . 
you get spots in pictures from it also . 
however ,  this isn t something you can adjust yourself . 
you re rolling the dice if you buy this . 
this is the most amazing waste of money . 
life is too short for poor quality coffee . 
the crystals are mostly flat and do not capture the light well . 
then it s back to hitting x at the appropriate time . 
i m always on the make for a new one to use . 
took a whole bottle and saw no change . 
it is virtually the exact same game ,  with more cumbersome controls . 
sometimes with ice ,  and sometimes with frozen fruit . 
a couple of young girls broke pieces off my twisting . 
design is not good ,  don t ask me why . 
also ,  during gameplay ,  the dumbest things let you get furthur . 
it really wasn t worth the hassle or effort . 
i wish it were better ,  but that is the conclusion . 
the order arrived quickly and i put them on and they felt awesome . 
it goes from closed ,  to a sloppy spray . 
just sweet ,  but doesn t taste much like peanut butter . 
we will continue to look for a  green  dishwashing gel . 
you can stop from overdub but not start the loop . 
would be a great product if it worked when you needed it to . 
the caliper itself looks the same but the packaging was completely different . 
it did not have any smell nor did my skin feel softer . 
i took a chance andordered a second case and it was the same . 
this has the feel of  stab your neighbor in the back  . 
seagate num_num yr warranty seems like the way to go . 
this product made no difference to my breathing unfortunately . 
i am going to make this short but true . 
nothing good can come of such a thing . 
most of then are years old ,  stemming from num_extend etc . 
still ,  very unhappy with this but maybe i just had bad luck . 
so thought these would be great for lights . 
but serves the purpose of people on the run well  . 
the game opens with a terrible song called tears of blood . 
good ,  etc  ,  and this one was our least favorite . 
it s just a vitamin for crying out loud . 
they re sharp and makes them useless and very dangerous . 
if you want to play an mmorpg ,  get world of warcraft . 
da bird is my cats  absolute favorite interactive toy . 
frankly ,  i m not buying that as a full explanation . 
i had these headphones for maybe a couple of years before they died . 
i like the way it rolls forward as you walk . 
after putting it back together it didn t work anymore . 
however ,  the straps on this bag are way too short . 
it tastes like i imagine tea brewed with liffey water might . 
the included adapter only works as a charger . 
i thought it lacked in durability and creativity for the age group . 
my time is worth more then their hassles . 
after testing ,  the item no longer would get cool . 
as you can see ,  there is an african grey in the pic . 
and sadly that amazon did not except any grocery return . 
that way ,  the child can ask questions and you can provide answers . 
i felt that there was no benefit at all . 
this charger does not work with the ipad ,  as listed . 
it sounds way more fun than it actually is . 
a few months later the same happened with my other set . 
i m just writing this last sentence to get to the required length . 
i got this for a ruger lcr and it just a little small . 
the music quality was spot on and not a problem . 
i contacted apple about this and was told their aware of this problem . 
we quickly replaced this purchase with something better . 
it is imperative that the skin stay well moisturized . 
volume toggle stop working after a couple of weeks . 
my kitten did not like it and refused to use this litter . 
and there s plenty variety of cars to choose from . 
the color is not all that great and the price is too much . 
i returned it to amazon and now ordered another brand . 
there is no one who can help you . 
not easily usable by the child of the age group listed . 
the photos depict cute little decorated cakes that look like petit fours . 
unless you like graphics over game control don t buy this game !  . 
the tip of my first one broke the first time i used it . 
i also apply a base color and highlight my hair . 
in addition it leaks and causes water damage to everything it sits on . 
i wound up ordering the software for  more $ plus shipping . 
it looks cool ,  but it s smaller than you see . 
pretty much tasted like cranberry juice with a tiny bit of bubbles . 
you can also scan alphabetically ,  scan by artist and so on . 
i sent it off to nikon for repair . 
it also darkened tte screen on the phone . 
i cleaned those off and applied it and smoothed it out . 
i had to ship back to amazon four times . 
the num_extend does not run under all windows systems !   . 
had one of these knives ten years ago . 
manually crank the lens to num_extend infinity and nothing in focus . 
this polarizer works differently from previous circular polarizers i have owned . 
kind of surprised to see such positive reviews here . 
first off ,  the design is obnoxious adn its very bad quality . 
both neighbors have complained about the noise from the blender . 
i was not thrilled and the shipping was way too long . 
i have ordered these before and was happy with them . 
it is also a bear to get into . 
i don t know what i was thinking when i ordered these . 
the colors are nice and my son is excited to use it . 
i tried everything to make these work with no luck . 
i bought the pan set for the panasonic flash xpress toaster oven . 
these headphones would most likely fall off often . 
bluetooth they  think  may be fixed in a future update . 
after noticing the phone didn t work any longer i replaced the batteries . 
the optics on this brunton were like looking through a plastic kids toy . 
lack of charm  sot had lots of num_extend
their customer service people are not much help either . 
the wireless range is very short num_num feet max . 
i tried resetting the handheld several times and eventually it came back on . 
considering how expensive it was ,  it should have lasted longer . 
when you wash them ,  you know they are completely clean . 
note that the material is very thick and a heavy bra . 
next ,  the squeegee is used to press out the air bubbles . 
these are definitely not flakes but more like granulated yeast . 
when this bra arrived ,  it was like a bad joke . 
they do add some minerals and vitamins in it . 
i ll be contacting hoover to see what they can do . 
that is what is supposed to hold the lacing in place . 
then it doesn t start or power on at all . 
i m already very pissed i wasted $ renting it from blockbuster . 
the points system was alo the same material but even smaller . 
i thought it would be on the inside of the cup . 
the sound from my original headphones ,  also labeled samsung ,  are great . 
i was hoping for romantic dusky night with a hint of moonlight . 
not pretty . it gets two stars for the ease of application . 
the pedals are decent quality and i have no issues with their construction . 
it is reminiscent of my mom s theatrical pancake makeup of the num_extend
my dog does not like it at all . 
a few high profile failures have tried this ,   anarchy online anyone ?   . 
don t buy this ,  it is not worth throwing your money on . 
the design is hot ,  the `staying power  for the buck was not . 
perhaps this product only works on certain people ?  i would believe that . 
i d give them num_num stars ,  if i could . 
my ferocious cocker spaniels were apparently too much for it . 
he said they smelled bad enough ,  but didn t work . 
seriously ,  don t waste your money on this one . 
i have a num_num gallon high tech planted discus aquarium . 
for num_num calories  if memory serves  i ll just grab a granola bar . 
i just ordered a samsung tab dedicated charging system and hope it works . 
i ll stick with now egg white protein ,  also from amazon . 
 path of neo  is not worth your time or patience . 
he wanted attention and petted ,  and that rarely happens . 
i bought this pen to fill in where i should have hair . 
living in hawaii ,  i have easy access to excellent fresh pineapple . 
where does god of war really go wrong ?  it oversteps its bounds . 
these could make a fine container garden on a sunny patio . 
but seriously this pan is awful to cook with . 
 : > note :  my rating is strictly for the said application . 
i ve tried both purchased cables ,  neither one worked . 
it makes the game a lot longer than it should be . 
wow ,  titus ! music :  the musical score is truly amazing . 
domi chased him around the zone attempting to check him . 
if i let it go it would stop charging . 
i lost my scissors in a move and these were ordered for replacement . 
i ll stick to the powder in the box type . 
the description does not say that it is aluminium wire . 
but the fabric wasn t very durable and was torn apart very quickly . 
came broken but amazon . com credited the money back right away . 
unfortunately ,  the steamer stopped working after about two months . 
ever since then ive been battling the yest . 
after i pulled it out ,  i noticed that the tip had bent . 
you ll get no warning ,  and the timer recording will simply fail . 
i am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials . 
use burt s bees radiance facial cleanser with royal jelly . 
it s very cheaply made which is why it is priced so cheap . 
it s horribly bitter even when put in with extra water . 
i am not sure what that means but that might be me . 
we use it with the cord always now . 
it is really hard to tell if it helped . 
there s better jerky out there ,  a lot better . 
or pick up rainbow six ,  or even the darkness . 
didnt stay up well ,  and ripped after num_num use . 
for these situations it needs to be more of a gradual speed up . 
i will keep looking for an aluminum free deoderant that is longer lasting . 
i will keep an eye out for more firmware updates . 
this item is difficult to get into and difficult to adjust . 
i really needed some better directions with this . 
i instintly was reminded of that game while reading about project g . 
but the full nail images are simply too small . 
i do not have to do that with loreal s version . 
so ,  i won t be taking them back out . 
if it worked it have been a great help . 
like many i have almost plucked my eyebrows away . 
spend the extra couple dollars and go with the kelty brand sack . 
plus i don t like having my screen facing out . 
if i don t succeed quickly ,  this will go back to amazon . 
i have used other fiskars products and have been very pleased with them . 
the only natural deodorant that works for me is soapwallakitchen sold on etsy . 
it is convenient ,  but way to hard to chew . 
i wanted to use it on an excedrin . 
i will keep them for halloween or some other fitting occasion . 
needless to say ,  we rarely let the kiddo play with them . 
it was located by plain old sticky boards . 
she is now one year and this toy has gotten little play . 
like everyone else i was very excited to try this product . 
and i ve had several for over num_num years . 
as other reviews stated ,  the assembly is a horrible experience . 
i have held it upside down and it is absolutely leak proof . 
i find it to be thick and clumpy . 
the developer ,  ensemble studios ,  really screwed up on this game . 
no explanation . it gave an error message and that was that !  . 
the best thing about these is the price . 
the side support arms are easy to move around ,  if needed . 
overall more of a frustrating rather than fun experience . 
no matter the grind setting ,  it spit out dust and coffee chunks . 
i do like the blueberry bliss luna bars however . 
i would not recommend this for large dogs . 
this is not a good product for learning to tie shoelaces . 
that item is acceptable and will fullfil the intended purpose . 
this tiny little bowl is so not worth the price . 
i would possibly buy this brand again ,  but not this type . 
after  repair ,   the phones exhibit the same problem . 
this is not a polish but a cleaner and degreaser . 
after somewhat satisfactory use for about five years ,  it failed completely . 
just doesn t work at all in my application . 
there s nothing smooth or refined about the sound at all . 
i should have spent the extra money and got a better built unit . 
it only has a ,  b ,  c and d . 
cuisinart is supposed to be the top of the line . 
the pieces are everywhere and it s just a mess . 
also allowed speakers and microphone to be share with the current active computer . 
it was damaged and so back it went . 
he tasted it once and never touched it again . 
personally ,  i ll take a pass on this flavor . 
they are sloppy wide unless i put on socks . 
cat really does not like it at all . 
i knew that i was in trouble on the very first mission . 
i m the type of person who likes a strong sour lemon candy . 
these earrings are cheap looking and not worth the price . 
i used tape for awhile and then gave up on it . 
if not ,  you probably won t even finish this game . 
i m not the only one to say these things . 
my skin has greatly improved since going natural . 
things were fine till it happened again and then again . 
that should tell customers and the makers something . 
my num_num month old has never been interested in playing with this toy . 
i worked for about a month ,  but then it failed . 
they are now in the recycle bin . do not purchase these cables . 
these are apparently to help you secure the cover to the seat . 
can t use this anymore because my keurig num_extend is a brick . 
we could probably have bought it cheaper in the local chinese grocery store . 
however ,  the pets are annoying and scratch up your furniture . 
i m sorry to report that this device does not work very well . 
very poor and must have been really old . 
i made sure i wasn t standing in water when they were around . 
i thought the straps would be more of a fabric . 
kong toys ,  on the other hand ,  have been % hits . 
guess they changed styles ,  but amazon is displaying the later model . 
i dismounted the tire and checked things out . 
the buttons are well placed and the scroll wheel works great . 
this product did not help me at all . 
i have since tied it to a string ,  which she likes alright . 
it s under the model number num_extend  l for linux  . 
will the rest make till tomorrow or it fall apart . 
i should have sent it back ,  but i didn t . 
it also leaks air when pumping and the pressue guage is useless . 
they don t fit; i decided to return them . 
i tried a different product on the market with much better results . 
oh ,  and you can only install it num_num times . 
i got this unit ,  loaded a battery and plugged it in . 
i think these are no longer made in the good old usa . 
i do my best to trade for a biscuit but to no avail . 
i haven t seen one flea in all that time . 
i bought this product num_num months ago and it has already stopped working . 
unfortunately ,  i don t have a nephew to give it away to . 
i have super oily eyelids ,  and these boast about being long lasting . 
it has a square knock out where there should be none . 
  it was when i was num_extend at least . 
so far ,  it is two for two for chef s kettles . 
i just got this ,  and tried it on before i washed it . 
shaver does not always charge when sitting on the device . 
leaves a bad taste in my mouth for days . 
well ,  that isn t exactly narrowing down to anything useful . 
i actually sat there for two hours waiting for him to start . 
i have to use a second razor to finish my neck . 
it s been of no use to me whatsoever . 
compared to the psp this a total flop . 
it worked for a few hours and stopped working . 
i used this item approximately five to six times . 
in short ,  this product may well stain your teeth . 
the problem is with the tedious game play . 
it provided no relief or benefit and was a complete waste of money . 
hours later ,  even after a shower ,  i still feel dirty . 
they managed to be slightly frumpier looking in real life too . 
they break within months ,  if not doa out of the box . 
i really liked the origional sims for num_extend
i just recently got a powershot num_extend which i love . 
i ll stick to the pure stuff from now on . 
i really wanted to get this for my son for xmas . 
the size and price seemed right ,  just too flimsy . 
i bought this for a ruger num_extend that i have . 
the left side stopped working and i had to throw these out . 
yes you get two of the sleeves ,  but i m not pleased . 
he urinated on my carpet instead of the litter box . 
my son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly . 
the second one would not stay together on my phone kept falling apart . 
these will hang very loose and closely approximate traditional boxers . 
we now use the magic jack and only make occassional calls . 
thankfully i tried it before trying it on my child . 
i purchased num_num of these based on some of the reviews i read . 
to say i was heartbroken was an understatement . 
i use it now as a toy for her . 
volume controls are ok ,  but other ones are unusable . 
as seen on tv smart money clip by storus double sided . 
fortunately my glasses were on my face at the time . 
not worthy of the carboard box it comes in . 
each of them  not the rc anyway  takes too damned long to finish . 
watch out these are not just plain dry roasted almonds !  !  !  . 
don t loose the tool or drop the jets !  !  !  . 
product is bulky and takes up too much space . 
they are too big for the track size . 
num_num cartridge so their parents had something to do . 
i got rid of it just as quick as i bought it . 
it should specifically say will not fit the att samsung num_extend version . 
i wish i could say the same about yeowww !  catnip toys . 
i ordered a pair of nb num_extend men s shoes . 
this game simply does not meet the hype . 
not sure then it would fit my body frame well anyways though . 
the storage for the building pieces is a joke . 
i looked on their website ,  but no information there . 
the hip ,  seat and crotch area were tight . 
these include a lot of customization apps and loads more . 
i have anothr battery and a piece of garbage in my garage . 
my son loves the weapon and uses it with his other transformers . 
will give a report when i get it .   .  .  .   . 
how sad to see a classic so undermined by cost cutting . 
apparently i can t return the box of crackers . 
casio went down hill when they replaced metal with plastic . 
you can see and read more of my thoughts at agniusdigital . com . 
actually prevented a  pirate  from stealing the application or installing it for free . 
their return policy is effortless and returns are never questioned . 
they felt a bit awkward and it was definitely hard to control . 
the boxes of num_num look identical on the outside . 
perhaps this bra will work for those who are not very busty . 
for a child s easel ,  this is indeed nicely made . 
the bottle is a good size too ,  num_extend oz . 
since i use it topically ,  i don t care that much . 
who knows maybe a more expensive one does a better job . 
i am a rarity ,  but i hate essie polish . 
it rubs against the sides of my legs causing more problems then good . 
my wife uses it infrequently but i like quality . 
$ for the whole catit center was such a waste of money . 
i got the berry chews and it is much more bearable . 
in num_extend michigan did not play penn state or wisconsin . 
unfortunately ,  in the world of video capture ,  cheaper is not better . 
i did give it a second star ,  though . 
the coat came and it was really stiff . 
there was no way shown to repair a malfunctioned electrical connection . 
the glass literally fell out of the ring . 
deltran should change the label on the deltran battery tender jr . 
it worked ok for maybe num_num days and then quit spraying . 
it fits snuggly and protects the back ,  sides ,  and front . 
the light it produces replicates natural sunlight amazingly . 
all and all seems pretty durable unlike these other pairs i bought . 
paid num_num dollars and waited num_num days for ricino oil . 
i was happy with all ,  but not with this num_extend size . 
they also say too much salt will make it boil over . 
if we want herbs ,  we can easily buy them separately . 
parts of the aluminum also looked rusty and dirty . 
these are not . these look the same as the other brand . 
order this with extra batteries ,  if you want to use this light . 
i m still looking for that boss bottle filler upper . 
ok im gonna keep this simple this game is a waste of money . 
after five minutes out of the freezer they were back at room temperature . 
the base has images to match where each end belongs . 
they re a bit pricier than the regular larabars . 
next time i ll order from zappos as i normally do . 
this game isn t as great as the nfl blitz series for nintendo num_extend
i really like the look of this case; super cute . 
basically ,  go to the left block in the middle . 
my side sounded pretty good ,  but had to keep volume at max . 
this item doesn t adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin . 
i received this slinkly dog for my four year old daughter . 
i was looking for the temperature range to store the product . 
i see my own reflection about as well as looking in a mirror . 
its bad habits ,  if you break bad habits then you can lose . 
one star was given because of the condition of the cans . 
luckily ,  i rented this before deciding whether or not to buy . 
well ,  atlease it did not take too long . 
i didn t realize this was packed in vietnam until i received it . 
it took num_extend a good num_num hours to fall apart . 
if you don t ,  old grinded beans will accumulate . 
i don t believe this was a  damaged  machine . 
mario is much easier to control and the violence is more  cartoony  . 
don t know where or what kind of a material . 
i wish i could give it no stars . 
who knows ,  maybe it ll work for someone else . 
i first ordered this product from samsung ,  but it never arrived . 
i don t understand why this is the bestselling one . 
i was quite shock when i saw the wig . 
num_num on customer service . this is why the review is num_num star . 
super mario galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary . 
 and still i couldn t put together the snowman . 
whoever thought a cutout  entrance  side was a good idea is an idiot . 
the socks are much smaller and the feel is very different . 
this ball was bigger than i thought it be and is hard pastic . 
you can switch back and forth between them . 
i have two different ones ,  and they last . 
i love oxo utensils and have many of them . 
leave that up to the num_extend and sega saturn . 
i like this product and bought it about num_num weeks ago . 
the location of the stairs makes no sense . 
i had to force myself to finish a season last year with tp num_extend
the remote s  code search  capability cannot find a code for it . 
i actually do like how it looks on my dog . 
my advice :  buy the belkin and skip this product . 
fayt escapes to find himself alone on a backwards planet . 
leash is great and i use it with a different  harness  . 
it should have been done before release to the public . 
the first time i had fixed at my cost . 
obviously from use ,  but this shouldn t be happening so quickly . 
it is not suited to a small palmcorder or larger camcorder . 
you could get other plastic ones here on amazon for $ plus shipping . 
most car radios can tune down to num_extend or so . 
the spraying is three sprays making the strength very weak . 
it makes acne worst with all the bad chemical . 
and this is why the game has a lot of controversy . 
don t think you re getting the revere kettle of your memory . 
they try to insult your intelligence because you find the game lacking . 
the green junk would warp in a ohio summer heat . 
the product is really cute ,  and yes i know it s cheap . 
the  teeth  on this opener just slip .  .  . very disappointed . 
it may be a fluke ,  but that was my experience . 
they cause a blister on my achilles tendon and pinch the baby toe . 
you have groups of peppermints in combinations of num_num i . e . 
it feels like a newborn s hair brush bristles . 
i like the silver tray it comes in . 
i wish i could give this product num_num stars . 
it s not worth the trouble to return them . 
when i tried to use it ,  it stained my shoes . 
it appears to be well made so mine just might be defective . 
this was the worst piece of crap i have ever purchased . 
it includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments . 
it actually makes a great seat belt for your dog . 
i kept noticing that the phone was always on vibrate only . 
at the time i bought this item ,  it was selling for $
also no way to save games except at checkpoints . 
the birchwood casey cloth seems dry like an ordinary cloth . 
did not open and decided to return them . 
ugh !  i think the lanolin in this just clogged my pores . 
i was excited to try this for my golden retriever . 
my cats like the drinkwell so decided to try the num_num oz reservoir . 
this older version does not work with comcast internet . 
$ would have been about right . caselogic is apparently in financial trouble . 
after reloading ,  it will shoot uncontrollablythe game is good for one reason . 
this is as weak and tasteless as diluted dishwater . 
what was i thinking buying lee ?  maybe it was the price . 
additionally ,  they are gigantic !  i will not be purchasing again . 
i put the thundershirt on him ,  wrapped it around tightly . 
this did not ,  but did show same name and logo without usa . 
dpn t be fooled by the riedel name on these . 
i am going to give them one more chance . 
there is a disclaimer on the package warning against uv exposure . 
it s well made and sturdy but other than that it s boring . 
so off to target to buy final fantasy unlimited saga . 
i will never again pay any attention to the reviews on amazon . 
the strain relief on this thing is a joke . 
but i did not have good results with this one . 
the acting is terrible and completely drags you out of the game . 
then you defend your titles until you lose them . 
the food does not cook evenly or often times at all . 
i returned after fearing it could make me break out from reading reviews . 
how come ?  i did a test of it when i got home . 
i really liked the idea of a media server . 
it worked but i don t use it anymore . 
i did eventually get it to turn on and stay on . 
expensive but my cats love the taste and all ingredients are the best . 
this game also lacks a lot of consistency from the first game . 
also drawstring is much smaller ,  more like a shoelace . 
so far however ,  it was a pretty expensive num_num minutes . 
no bett than any other regular lotion i ve used on my feet . 
good fashion does not have to be uncomfortable or a struggle . 
and whatever she can pull out of the garbage from time to time . 
the stainless was mirror polished and the black was as coal . 
also ,  my filter won t attach the top correctly . 
but you are gonna have to deal with the horrid lemony flavor . 
unfortunately ,  the mini chipper holds only num_num tbsp . 
they should call it dead pony rather than maverick . 
first the dogs can climb out of it easily . 
the texture was also very different and not very palatable . 
i was able to produce about num_num bubbles in total . 
i put them on my num_num year olds head and it was small . 
the developers didn t work very hard on it . 
i would not believe that the fps is num_extend it seems much weaker . 
for me ,  it wasn t worth it at all . 
i must say that i do not like this eyeliner . 
i got this and it is fake looking and frizzed so bad . 
some people might like this ,  but i thought it was too big . 
nope ,  they require you provide information they have no business having . 
the tip of the charger broke the next day . 
this is almost like mechwarrior at times but without the innovation . 
the voice should be less repetitive and annoying too . 
there is no help in the manual or site concerning mmc card capacity . 
i ended up tossing it in the trash after num_num uses . 
i am just reviewing based on my dogs preference . 
so i don t think it was my fault . 
looks great ,  but is easily destroyed within minutes by a smart dog . 
it runs large ,  the secure system is not secure at all . 
i purchased num_num pets and attempted to set up their online access today . 
i learned my lesson to mail order speakers . 
there s really not that much more to get out of it . 
i just assumed most of the problems were user configuration errors . 
this product is labeled % of what you want  . 
worse ,  it loses its connection to the phone on a regular basis . 
you either don t feel it or it zaps you . 
mixed with hot water ,  all this tastes like is peppermint . 
there s no real plot except get through the levels . 
but it s still just a boring button masher . 
better off just returning it and trying something different . 
but i can t imagine anyone else being pleased with this purchase . 
battery cover is not part of the battery . 
my best advise is buy some other theething item . 
it completely takes away the appeal of a touch screen for me . 
it just does not work with this battery . 
i do not like the trimmer and neither do my num_num cats . 
worked fine for about num_num months ,  then broken . 
very expensive for an item that lasts only a few months . 
this sunblock has been recommended to me but unfortunately i cannot use it . 
stopped working just after a one year mark . 
however ,  the same cannot be said about the new entry ,  num_extend
it is everything you don t want in a mascara . 
sure ,  it looks cool ,  but that s about it . 
mario has lost his way since the days of the num_num bit nintendo . 
there are better ,  equally affordable alternatives out there . 
a much less expensive and more useful ,  if bulkier ,  proposition . 
well ,  i found that using motospeak was mostly useless . 
the front label is totally different from the pic above . 
although expensive ,  this seems to be the best solution . 
i picked up a cookie and bit into it .  .  . stale . 
i packed it up and sent it back to amazon . 
it is around the same thickness as the vertex case . 
went back to a modified tooth brush and q tip . 
i may be forced to use a walkthrough with this game . 
save your money and your time and get the little wil . 
this product gets a very close shave and doesn t pull hairs . 
first ,  the optical port is for output ,  not input . 
i ended up tossing it because it was too flimsy . 
now that i am done with it ,  i wanted to sell it . 
we tried ,  we really tried ,  to play this game . 
else it would sound like some feeble noise in the background . 
bought this for my husband to keep in his work truck . 
documentation is very skimpy and the online info is not much better . 
however ,  getting it to the right flavor took a lot of shots . 
the real earl grey is sold in the green container which is pricier . 
we use the volume but it still seems loud . 
if you play hockey or lift weights ?  don t but these . 
i gave it four stars for fun and two stars overall . 
i won t even get into the crappy stock cap switch . 
so choose the bigger size when you buy it . 
i was told they do occasionally refund entirely in this situation . 
pressure indicator drops immediately after removing from heat source . 
this does not work on a stronger dog that pull s alot . 
i got this thinking it would fit my sprint samsung galaxy s . 
i usually like natori brand but the fit was weird on this bra . 
if you are looking for a larger one ,  i recommend fagor splendid . 
save yourself some time and effort and go for something else . 
the need for speed series is not good for the ds . 
plenty of war materials to get anyone happy . 
i expected much more because of the positive reviews . 
i had a real good impression of petmate products . 
this is the particular bluetooth adapter that apple recommends . 
this step makes it really easy then to feed the better juicer . 
toss game into the used pile on amazon . 
clearly this was a used item not in proper packaging . 
this was not a good game at all . 
i think they changed the formula so buyer beware . 
when i saw her chewing on those i was not impressed . 
the num_extend always stop working after i restarted the computer . 
it starts with a crack or tear where the wire meets the plug . 
that is significantly more expensive than basic paints . 
i mean it should not have changed my nice phone pink . 
we got the batteries in ,  but the toy simply didn t work . 
but if you are using a municipal water supply ,  forget it . 
i tried and tried but couldn t get past the hair grabbing . 
it sounds very good ,  and i really like the replaceable battery . 
the plastic bearing caps are not sealed either . 
it smells like really strong cherry cough syrup mixed with vicks vaporub . 
i am pretty sure this is not a real otterbox product . 
pairing it with my cell phone yields very limited utility . 
makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems . 
as far as i am concerned i wasted my money on this . 
the bosses are way to hard and this game had a small budget . 
he has dysplastic hips and is still sore after exercise . 
i also searched for it in the stores . 
no way will i ever buy these again . 
my forehead is wrinkly and no peeling in sight . 
your best friend of member of your party turns on you . 
on mine ,  all the characters displayed as big white boxes . 
i turned the monitor off for a while ,  rebooted ,  etc . 
all of the major companies originate in the land of the rising sun . 
but i am very disappointed in this product . 
having your pet with you and having both hands free is wonderful . 
in conclusion smackdown num_num is the better buy . 
i roll it around and they just don t care . 
i guess the ones i am looking for are no longer made . 
in theory this should ve worked out well but it didn t . 
those little green ones that are supposed to be easily killed with bt . 
i could never get used to these strange flavor substitutes . 
i am very disappointed with this linksys product !  . 
if you need the performance of the original battery look for the energizer num_extend
gta must have a difficulty setting adjustment !  !  !  !  no excuses . 
i have only lifted it whilst it was empty . 
this case isn t even worth the few bucks i spent on it . 
charge me a little bit more but please stop skimping on the treats . 
do not be fooled by the wonderful television ad s . 
it is really impossible to see the screen . 
i wanted different color other than the one i have . 
the sheild was very hard to put on the screen . 
i would not recommend this bra unless you are a small busted woman . 
my roots were showing and i was just ready for a change . 
i upgraded the firmware to latest verion num_extend and the probles worsened . 
however ,  compared to the rest that i looked at . 
i bought this to keep my smartphone charged while using gps navigation . 
i already saw the thread getting bent and worn out on first num_extend
we would not recommend this crate and would not purchase it again . 
the seller won t refund unless it is unopened . 
should of done more research on it before i purchased this . 
i don t know how can i use for . 
fabric on the sides fray out it does not stand up properly . 
it loses more air upon removal than just using my pump does . 
the daydream basic sleep mask with cool pack worked for me . 
resources like water and rice that grows make the game more interesting . 
the blade no extras are provided is dull and the structure is cheesy . 
i wish i had not made such a mistake . 
sorry budk ,  you really choked on this one . 
this is by far the better of the num_num trimmers . 
it feels like they re found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity . 
i emailed them num_num days ago ,  and have heard nothing back . 
i took a flier on this after reading the reviews . 
the case is plastic ,  and not particularly good plastic at that . 
i thought this would be a great alternative . 
it s bulky and you can buy other products that are better . 
unless this thing is filled with peanut butter she never goes near it . 
he really likes it but does not play with it anymore . 
i am always losing my place when i try to read a book . 
i bought this looking for a cheap watch to go running with . 
best to find another higher quality product from another manufacturer . 
i really liked playing tug and throwing it for my little terrier . 
in the middle of our vacation it started forgetting things again . 
the picture looked great but i hate it . 
sometimes you get what you pay for and this is no exception . 
and give myself no stars for being an idiot as well . 
i will not buying another ff game again . 
apparently ,  taste of the wild is owned by diamond pet foods . 
i use it for muscle pain and joint pain . 
too much trouble to return ,  though ,  so i ll keep them . 
i got this for our daughter when she was six months old . 
as for the flavor ,  it is not very good . 
this can be done hundreds of times with a wooden spoon . 
after you save and quit ,  the enemies return . 
i have been using memorex dvd+rw disks for a few years . 
because sound is more important for me i gave num_num stars overall . 
everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared . 
i don t think this product likes my skin ,  or vice versa . 
there are some pinch valves it simply will not fit in . 
they re dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound . 
it doesn t even meet the edges of the jar . 
pretty much a waste of money ,  time ,  and several meals . 
straight forward in use . cons :  do not use for concealed carry . 
the box is practically impossible to scoop out of . 
my puppy like to scratch the bed when first use . 
certain bars of the lcd were unreadable and others were stuck . 
my personal experience with super seed is of bloating and constipation . 
i ve tried to coax her to play with it with no luck . 
i followed the directions perfectly and was sadly disappointed !  . 
shipped fast with good protection and double boxed . 
i have written to them to notify this and asked for a refund . 
this has got to be the talkiest video game i ve ever played . 
i have also had good luck with the nutrimill unit . 
and like i mentioned ,  shipping was fairly speedy  less than a week  . 
spend a little more money and get a chrome stand . 
the thumb lever broke rendering the item completely useless . 
i have a bigger size and deceided to give this one a try . 
i cannot upload any video from the camera  a powershot num_extend to computer . 
this is the first time i have experienced this with amazon !  . 
after the game installed it wanted me to register it . 
if you like the canned cocoa you will not like this . 
gelsemium sempervirens is a flowering vine called yellow jessamine . 
credit was received before the week was even over . 
my jawbone was fantastic at noise cancellation ,  as expected . 
unfortunately ,  my previous experiences held up to be true once again . 
i finally took to stitching it and it is okay . 
it will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean . 
the winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever . 
i m seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the simpsons . 
the scent is nice but the lotion just doesn t work for me . 
but after opening the box ,  the blush was smashed into pieces . 
glued new ones on with special glue and its fine . 
i can t even express how disappointed i am right now . 
i have this router and just bought the linksys num_extend to replace it . 
then i read it is the same development team . 
i am not quite happy with the price . 
this is the last tuffy toy i purchase . 
however ,  i am disappointed after my first try . 
i was expecting small pieces but the pieces from the num_num oz . 
i am not satisfied with the performance of this at all . 
she s not extremely finicky but wouldn t even taste it . 
this product is as close to useless as it can get . 
it leaks just because it feels like leaking . 
i think i saw a tiny reduction but not even sure . 
now i wonder if amazon will take it back ?  . 
for the price next time ill just go to target or something . 
i got this on the recommendation of a friend . 
these speakers produce a quarter of the volume my laptop speakers have . 
the set up of this looks to be exactly the same . 
waste of money !  they usually like cat toys with catnip . 
this was num_num years ago and i m still happy about the decision . 
it has a less expensive dispostion about it . 
if you get a bubble ,  good luck fixing that . 
if your kids is not num_num or up don t even bother . 
hard to apply and very hard to take off . 
it did the job and kept me full for num_num hours . 
it s like watching a movie in slow motion . 
after playing with it for a while ,  i am somewhat disappointed . 
alright ,  so this is supposed to be exceedingly authentic . 
my ankles hurt after about num_num minutes of wear . 
the instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage . 
then i was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use . 
as other reviewers have indicated ,  this watch is not waterproof . 
must be made for someone with no boobs . 
the rubber tip does not  do its job  . 
i would spend an hour a day cleaning and blow drying her . 
so no more cow femurs for me or her . 
again ,  we may have a cheap knock off . 
i was trying to figure out which size i should be wearing . 
it seems to work better and is overall better designed . 
it stopped holding a full charge which should last num_num hours . 
what does that have to do with windows live ,  you may ask . 
it s very frustrating not to be able to use this product . 
i cannot belive this unit had so many good reviews . 
it had a few scratches and it was faded . 
this battery will not work as a replacement . 
now only half of the bar produces bubbles . 
after reading all the rave reviews i thought i d love this stuff . 
if you can find this product from another supplier ,  do so . 
the focus is also dead slow and often doesn t lock on . 
i just ended up with ears full of water . 
like most final fantasy fans ,  i was extremely disappointed with this installment . 
batteries only fit in the controller if jammed in . 
we bought this and it lasted about num_num months . 
the carp anodizing is a joke on these . 
it is also a known skin irritant and contact allergen . 
the player has been plagued with problems since about num_num months after purchasing . 
the truth is ,  it can t hold a signal in a car . 
num_num stars bc at least the company has clearly stated warnings on packaging . 
there is one month s worth of pads in the box num_extend
takes a fair amount of time to register the temperature . 
i got two of these and both lasted about num_num minutes combined . 
when i got it though that was a completely different story . 
hope i can find someone who does like them . 
i would sooner shave my head than ever use this product again . 
the wonderful reviews prompted me to buy this product . 
didn t do a thing to get rid of the circles . 
it is getting really hard to find quality products anymore . 
if any one has some tips please post them . 
even the spice flavors are muted and off . 
i am playing the digital version ,  and find it ok . 
i liked that it was stainless steel and had some sort of feet . 
soe ruined the game with the combat upgrade . 
i am appalled at how poorly this game was designed . 
although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry . 
the barricade router has been a complete nightmare . 
the only acceptable service in this whole mess was the turnaround time . 
particularly when someone specifically said  they re not too salty  . 
it isn t though and the sound quality is shockingly bad . 
i have a wide head and long hair . 
i have taken straight apple cider before and never had any problems . 
the smell and taste and texture is much more refined and well . 
now i ve been told my whole life i have a gigantic head . 
otherwise they are a great tasting protein bar . 
this case protects my phone while adding very little bulk to my phone . 
and there is little if any help by the gms . 
$ for one small can is absurd for num_num small burgers . 
the smell is different ,  the taste is absolutely awful . 
so they puppets are useless unless you sew them onto a glove . 
i think that gameshark num_num is a waste of money . 
i only bought white because they were cheaper than the retail color sets . 
not even worth a phone call don t order it . 
when removing them from the package they were cracked and crumbly . 
i ve been eyeing these speck fabric colored cases for awhile . 
the cover is a perfect fit for the tween mattress . 
then the bottles move around too much during shipment and leak all over . 
they taste ok ,  but so do just about any brand . 
thus using the autofight button is almost required . 
turns out that it tastes just like apple juice . 
i am larger chested ,  a num_extend and this bra offered zero support . 
and to make it worse ,  icracked doesn t offer exchanges . 
but the music happens to be poorly done on this port . 
it took like num_num minutes to end these boring battles . 
quality control is less than lacking in this . 
the case broke with in the hours that i had it . 
 oh nd there were glitches at the end  . 
they re less than half as high ,  definitely not ankle to knee . 
this stuff gave me one of the worst headaches i ve ever had . 
no statement for materials used to make these items . 
iti ended up getting another brand for about $ and love it . 
these worked ok for a while ,  then they died . 
even in mild thunder this makes no noticeable impact . 
i noticed no effects and it s pretty thin and runny . 
and quick ,  your hit might leave ,  so it s timed . 
it was pretty overpowering ,  but i went ahead and applied the cream . 
it makes your hair smell like fried chicken grease and it absolutely awful . 
feel the uncovered side of the bed ,  and then under the pillow . 
i sure appreciate them a lot more after this pachmayr disappointment . ps . 
this is the worst idea for a mario game . 
like my grandma says ,  penny wise ,  pound foolish . 
the way you control pac man is with a sling shot . 
the company did a very poor design job . 
aspercreme comes in lotion  liquidy  and creme and is much cheaper than mobisyl . 
it s constructed of very thin gauge wire and flexes very easily . 
unfortunately ,  this hummingbird feeder merits some attention for the wrong reasons . 
at least % of the batteries were dead and not usable . 
the coffee arrived on time and the packing was good . 
his seven advisors all turned out to be wretchedly evil . 
the art is cartoonish and good at it . 
i wanted to do it at home in between visits . 
i spent forever trying to get the streaks out ,  but nothing worked . 
date and most of the brownies have mold on them . 
the taste is not very consistent from nut to nut . 
i don t like the feel or sound of these strings . 
i can pretty much make it go wherever i want . 
i returned two hoping the temp problem was a faulty unit . 
the sides of the case were bowing outward instead of being straight . 
all in all ,  the radio is just awkward to use . 
a little bit off and things could get really ugly . 
i just ordered a blendtec num_extend review pending . 
these cost % more and are very weak in the upper range . 
these ear plugs need to be evaluated compare to other under $ buds . 
like pretty much everyone else ,  i have a few pounds to lose . 
it isn t like starfleet command is the only one of its kind . 
this is what they seem to bank on . 
i continued to breakout so i discontinued use . 
this case seemed to have all that i was looking for . 
then the third day it didn t work at all . 
i ve decided to replace mine with cheaper ones . 
clearly the bowls are coming from china or some other country . 
it will not take slice of rye in one shot . 
it comes on thick and chalky and did not leave my skin moisturized . 
yuck . it s hard to describe just how bad this tastes . 
nowhere near as much fun as the factories and such . 
it doesn t add a lot of bulk to the phone . 
due mostly to the clunkiness of the character ,  the controls are difficult . 
first of all i need to explain my situation . 
these run a bit small and are fairly short . 
to make matters worse ,  the voice acting is painful to hear . 
parabens are  generally recognized as safe  by the fda . 
speedo has a good name ,  so i went for it . 
this is my first bad review on a product . 
well ,  i ve lost allot of faith in games anymore . 
wish i could give it no stars or minus stars . 
but that s not the reason i gave it just num_num stars . 
i didn t have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity . 
so i contacted both uk and us support . 
no matter how i positioned it ,  it wasn t very clear . 
this one came to me for free as a test product . 
it pops off easily and made of a very cheap material . 
you need to have specific models and thankfully most of my gadgets complied . 
i am so not impressed ,  i won t buy it again . 
wow !  am i blind because i cannot see the skull . 
some reviewers said that after num_num hours it becomes ok . 
it took a few weeks but they caught all the moths eventually . 
she needed to replace it and purchased this item . 
the truth is that this game is bad . 
however ,  over time this unit has revealed a major flaw . 
the pair that fit perfectly was manufactured in china . 
if you swing at all then it flies up and tilts back . 
i was disappointed with the flavor  not fruity enough for me  . 
i tossed it after a week of use . 
if you have an aggressive chewer do not buy this . 
you could not treat num_num people with this kit . 
i only use the outer filter threads for the lens cap . 
overall ,  this is a very frustrating toy for my num_num yr . 
it is really chalky and what flavor is there does not last long . 
also a constant humming no matter how well you match the frequency . 
we kept is so long because the coffee stays hot and delicious . 
still ,  pretty nice . i like how they fold up . 
my boyfriend predicted that the toy wouldn t last the night . 
total fat ,  based on daily value ,  is num_extend or %
first ,  the numbers on the tape are ridiculously small . 
if you really want to protect your clothing ,  look at another product . 
full bars of service even on the fringe areas of the sprint network . 
i have to cut them at the waist to wear them . 
if not the coffee with grounds will overflow . 
i do not recommend this ,  unless ginger  burns  are your thing . 
their original cd that i kept would not work in the new pc . 
another issue i have is the battery life . 
i can truly say this is a real dissappointment . 
these attachments are almost impossible to attach to the metal trimmer . 
the professional did not suggest a professional buffer . 
the water beads up and it is very easy to dry . 
one of the good things about  half life num_extend is the level variety . 
at the rate of replacement i can buy myself a new coffee machine . 
i stirred the mixture up and it would not dissolve . 
you are expected to do almost everything via touch . 
amazon was nice about it bit snoozer is timer service was horrible . 
my mom sent me an ad she got via email about this tool . 
tried these instead of the proin from the doc . 
i ve tried different angles by bending the base . 
i will not buy again and tempted to return . 
it s a little pricey ,  but i feel it s worth it . 
which is surprising because the both love to eat . 
fashionably conscious  dad ,  and even he laughed when he saw it . 
finally tried it in a  fat  playstation num_extend and it ran flawlessly . 
it was advertised as being a decent little print server for the money . 
advert was misleading that it would fit the listed cd players . 
way too big and slipped off my foot . 
quick and easy replacement by kitchenaid was the only plus in this episode . 
nice boot if you avoid rain ,  but did not meet my needs . 
any mark or scuff is highly visible and doesn t go away . 
there are so many things about this game that make it stupid . 
water ,  ground ,  rocks ,  and enemies look fake and blockish . 
i m disappointed with the performance of this product . 
sound was notably degraded from a cd played directly though the denon . 
it was very depressing to not have upright ducks . 
in fact i think it is quite bad . 
i went to several stores before i found a dropper at walgreens . 
it also left my hair tangled after washing . 
we re talking about random cars used as obstacles . 
this item did not quite look how i imagined it would . 
this perfume should be selling for about $
it says to remove with tissue and not to scrub . 
in terms of multiplayer ,  so much wasted potential . 
that was half the thrill of the other one . 
that has turned out to be not true . 
the patrol cars that i normally meet keep their radar turned on . 
this product arrived and does not look like the picture . 
my family would eat it and be better pleased as well . 
there are multiple tabs ,  with multiple options each . 
this was the first one that was unplayable . 
i ll shop at the store for these jeans from now on . 
same result when i try it on myself . 
too cartoonish and graphis arent much better . thumbs down on this one . 
i bought this shirt in july but didn t wear it until recently . 
it will crease almost immediately and rubs off . 
it is now on window sill of window construct of metal . 
my kids played with this for num_num minutes . 
but still ,  smc tech supports insists it s not their router . 
before taking this product ,  have a bone density test . 
i was literally hauling it to the garbage that very day . 
but after multiple calls in various locations no one could hear me well . 
give me the glass hands down any time any where . 
i thought i was buying a pack of these and only got one . 
did absolutely nothing for my back and chest . 
not worth it  !  i threw it away !  . 
for some reason i thought this was a popcorn product . 
not a fresh look . my bottle came with a pump . 
go to any dollar store and buy a box of strike anywhere matches . 
to me  professional  means working most days with somewhat heavy loads . 
exporting to youtube is more difficult as well . 
i should have sent them back but never did . 
these levers look great and seem very high quality . 
big issue for no gain and higher price . 
they sounded great so i was hoping the company would fix this problem . 
i just purchased some of these mints at the store . 
it is nothing like the first btvs game on xbox . 
that s a hell of a lot of bad reviews . 
this is what i get for trying to get something little cheaper . 
ea makes the same crap over and over . 
in effect camera became inoperational . sent it to olympus . 
i bought this bra to be cool and comfortable in the caribbean . 
i pulled everything loose and started from scratch . 
my size num_num older jeans fit me better . 
i was expecting something that would be much more absorbant . 
i really liked how the case looks and feels in your hand . 
it s a computer game that just isn t fun . 
i wanted headphones to use with my guitar amp . 
spend more and get a more competent product from a competent company . 
im still trying to find that majic fit . 
i really want to like this product ,  believe me . 
it made it worse !  i would never recommend this product to anyone . 
it really dried my hair out and damaged it . 
chilled body contracts blood vessels that restrict blood flow causing the cramps . 
it just did not meet my expectation at all . 
i have a logitech momo racing wheel with two pedals and win num_extend
well ,  maybe if you live alone or occasionally cook for num_extend
their garlic mask is amaze for shedding though . 
i received my num_extend one and it lasted exactly num_num hours . 
if this is an issue ,  turn it on and leave the room . 
no relief from this at least for me . 
i put pillpockets on it to get my dog to drink . 
this was the pump to keep my mixed salt water circulating . 
unfortunately he now has num_num blades to use . 
i wanted the wamer material as well as the elastic ankles . 
i purchased and played all the way through and was greatly dissapointed . 
a pity that what was a very useful brand has become so chinzy . 
i ordered these from a different site years ago num_extend
so i decided to sip it once it cooled . 
as others have noted ,  be prepared to get the wheels on . 
i am going back to plainer ,  but more well built umbrellas . 
just ten more words to describe an poorly made product . 
i thought i would really like this product . 
instructions say to leave it to dry ,  the bubbles will disappear . 
i believe i ve used it a total of num_num times . 
my dove shea butter soap lathers better and cleans better than this soap . 
it does seem to be more reliable when standing vertically . 
our nerves can not repair or develop without it . 
stay away from this one or at least get the updated version . 
you basically just watch it go around in a circle . 
it doesn t stick to the hair and falls again and again . 
i used this razor and merkur and feather blades . 
there were maybe num_num balls that met my expectations . 
with the voyager num_extend the seal was very good and no sound escaped . 
the ball point side includes a nice pen that writes nicely . 
the biggest problem was the stench that came from it . 
lavos was supposedly killed in ct and yet ,  he somehow survives . 
from now on will probably have to buy in a store ?  . 
it s far better dealing with people who have products vs one product . 
i suppose i had a beef with that . needs a pull top . 
not as thick and heavy as i thought they would be . 
all of these filtered water containers have been great . 
everyone who tried it found it tough to the point of being painful . 
you should advertise this crate for a large chihuahua . 
oblivion goes beyond just being an  action rpg  as far as that goes . 
i haven t had much luck with this product . 
this knife dulls quickly and can become unsafe to use . 
i used it seven times and every night it was the same . 
stay away from this product unless you like throwing your money away . 
i did that and now the printer won t work at all . 
he really hasn t shown much interest in it . 
i have a pretty old norelco rotary shaver that still work fine . 
this toy functioned fine where my dog is concerned . 
i sent in a report onm this item from another entry . 
this is a great case for holding your phone . 
a few days later ,  it peels ,  a little . 
it was a waste of my money ,  unfortunately . 
busido blade num_num is as original as fighting games get . 
probably after a full day of driving under the sun the plastic weakened . 
i paid premium price for this kind of junk . 
gives a military look with num_extend look and it glows in num_extend
it is worthless and is now a disposable piece of junk . 
i ll be returning this one to amazon as soon as i can . 
each played with it once or twice ,  for maybe num_num minutes . 
i ended up ordering my num_extend pair of skechers d lites . 
but this problem is not unique to these headphones . 
did not work for me because of side effects . 
the lucky charms had more sugar and less fiber . 
the soap was really messy so i ended up just tossing it . 
next time i ll just go to bestbuy for a camera case . 
i am very disapointed regarding the price vs the quality of these shoes . 
until this year ,  these chocolates were the best . 
the quality is very low; metal is thin and feels cheaply made . 
wasn t too difficult to figure out but then it did not work . 
turned it and proceeded to try and brush my teeth . 
there fun for a while you can also turn them into movies . 
the replacement unit has problems losing keystrokes on the linux system . 
i know after all these reviews i was excited to purchase . 
she can t read the cards and she can t remember anything . 
i noticed that it causes heartburn with or without food . 
every metal surface becomes extremely hot and is a high burn danger . 
the dialogue and the photos did not meet up for us . 
after a few days it dried out and was very small . 
this model has to be the worse electric brush i ve ever owned . 
it does  initially  make skin feel soft and moisturized . 
they are also perfect breeding grounds for fungus and mold . 
some of the cracks have gotten pretty large . 
i threw it out and will buy some other brand . 
it looks well constructed ,  but i had to return it . 
the second time was for a peeing incident and it worked less well . 
i ,  frequently ,  found the headset on my shoulder . 
he didn t like the strings being stuck on his butt . 
none of the bald spots grew back ,  not even a little bit . 
the num_num hv open circuit trigger voltage measures as much as num_num v . 
did i mention i love this knife ?  look . 
i don t know how many public places it keeps  failing  in . 
i have this vacuum cleaner and it is going back to the store . 
that is difficult for me ,  because i like to wear polish . 
i guess the num_num terrible ingredients weren t a big enough warning . 
the one i bought from cmp has clips on both ends . 
you must buy the harness along with the diaper holder . 
brew a cup of coffee using the k cup of your choice . 
rust all over the interior ,  just from boiling water . 
i personally would not buy this at this price . 
and you re melee attack is exactly the same . 
disappointed and do not plan to purchase this serum again . 
save your money and buy something of better quality instead . 
its very difficult to pull it off also . 
i will definitely not be using this product again . 
i gave this game to a local charity . 
for durability reasons ,  i don t like a whole lot of plastic . 
the quality is good ,  or superior but go for the longer handle . 
the  better  mode produces much smaller files ,  but at much lower quality . 
it froze up and the manual reset did nothing . 
i found two num_num footers that were each num_num ga . 
i have been flying helis since the late nineteen num_extend
do not use if you have sensitive skin . 
glad it didn t cost much  ,  stretches too easy . 
not that special of a thing for me . 
there is simply no payoff for sitting through a game of civilization iv . 
i really wanted to love this shampoo ,  but i can t . 
in both cases ,  i have experienced about a % defective rate . 
there is something different between the regular and small bites . 
this case is beautiful but hard to get off . 
the one we kept is ultra sensitive as another review states . 
i bought this seat to replace a stock seat that seemed too hard . 
i have cleaned and jiggled the motor etc . 
i ended up reterning it because it was so bad . 
if you have mature skin ,  head for a true tinted moisturizer . 
twice it put me under num_extend bridges when i m num_extend
i had two prior brushes lost ,  stolen back in the day . 
however ,  this game is specifically aimed towards kids . 
as sonic team s response to this ,  they made this game . 
so it isn t that we don t need iodine . 
my counts continue to rise  into abnormal range  . 
i was using the filter and that made it cumbersome to close . 
it needs to have a wider opening where the balls drop out . 
then i dealt with another rep who eventually decided i had bad hardware . 
bought this from  local store  based on the low price . 
the training video that comes with it is nice . 
but i was looking for something more along the lines of working out . 
thus ,  the objective of monopoly city is identical to its predecessors . 
i wanted to swap out sim cards between num_num phones . 
it pretty much works right out of the box . 
i got a shower that night and used it per the instructions . 
it would probably be great for a kitten . 
the list of those printers in not published . 
have been very happy with all of them . 
when it rotates around on both pedals ,  there is this absurd grinding . 
the ones in the shells are bigger and softer and full of flavor . 
this is far from the worst dog food on the shelf . 
in addition ,  it is very difficult to put up the tent alone . 
whoever designed the wand applicator should be fired . 
love the idea of the phone had it for num_num months . 
state of maine are the best and should have reordered that brand again . 
the plot is so unbelievalbe in a bad way . 
the num_extend performed very poorly pulling in only num_num digital stations . 
i use the senseo pods simply for convenience sake . 
my son received several toys for his first birthday . 
this new one with sunscreen is the problem . 
missing a rubber grip on one of the cups . 
wheat grass is alkalizing ,  healthy ,  and gluten free . 
this was breached and destroyed in less than num_num minutes . 
i use arnica montana for muscle soreness and rhus tox for arthritic knees . 
returning this one ,  buying an herb one to replace it . 
i did use it for the full time needed . 
the phone will now sometimes run out of batteries overnight . 
i have contacted amazon customer service and haven t received any response . 
you have to press harder than with standard pens . 
how about that ? graphics :  the game itself isn t bad . 
the movements of the laser are less than entertaining . 
more than % of my swatted passes were done manually . 
the holes don t align so i couldn t put two screws in . 
i recently switched to bar soap from liquid soap . 
smackdown vs raw is a big let down in the smackdown series . 
get this it was for no apparent reason . 
this is something which i believe the seller can easily correct . 
i usually always go with playtex because they seem to last longer . 
i think ill just buy her a real jewelry box . 
it took me hours to reconfigure the interior using dividers from other bags . 
youd think they would make it so it could allow clearance . 
it is very fragile and not suitable for younger children . 
i made the mistake of buying two pair . 
since we live in western new york where the winters are brutal . 
most biscuits are too big for the opening and when my num_num lb . 
should ve went with orbitz  also on sale for num_num cents  . 
that s when all the issues from the first phone started happening again . 
the inside fur does get matted down pretty quick . 
wish i d realized this before i exchanged them for another size . 
it also wasn t very stable and even ,  which is worrisome . 
after less than num_num uses ,  air compressor stops working . 
i don t have time for babying my pans like this . 
after that ,  the steam feature began to give me trouble . 
my num_num month old received when he was num_num months . 
i really like the style and the material . 
so ,  this lipstick lasts for many hours as advertised . 
for anyone who actually likes pancakes or waffles this mix is terrible . 
i ordered these leg avenue tights in  beige  from  ilovesexy  . 
i m not a person who likes to be confronted with choices . 
i am very happy with the itp holster . 
i paid $ for it and i got what i paid for . 
i bought this set in yellow from nomorerack . com . 
the story seemed sterile ,  uninteresting ,  and just plain boring . 
only i dont know what nevella is made from . 
my son still loves cars and racing games . 
flaxseeds offer more ala than chia ,  num_extend vs . 
manic panic just isn t strong enough for my hair i guess . 
if it wasn t cause of that i would had rated it num_extend
it s tall and wide making it awkward for small spaces . 
still tastes bad even with sugar and creamer added . 
it came out the size of a large or maybe even slightly smaller . 
biggest complaint is probably the seemingly small sensors . 
i have a small dog ,  approximately num_num lbs . 
i bought this stroller for the full $ at christmas time . 
in that price range  under $ it is a num_num star . 
wreckless cooly shows off the graphic power of the xbox . 
horrible !  ! i just installed it and played it num_num hour ago . 
the whole ordeal took almost half an hour . 
not a woman s average or just a little wider . 
top button on phone is very hard to press with this cover on . 
i usually go with a num_extend shirt for room and extra height . 
i also see there are a ton of other manufactures selling bumper replicas . 
there was a grittiness to the texture that i did not enjoy . 
the bottle of solution also leaked all over the place . 
this stuff is gross and almost impossible to stomach it . 
this item pops off the windshield regularly ,  and this is dangerous . 
it dropped signal just now ,  while i m writing this review . 
i passed them off on to my son andhe loves them . 
it did absolutely nothing to diminish my dark spots . 
which looked like the waring i d had previously . 
if you want to buy it ,  wait a few months . 
the phone was not the quality as advertised . 
i got my butt handed to me in seconds . 
this product did nothing to alleviate the problem . 
after a few months ,  the card started to really sputter . 
i am not returning it cause i gave it to my broh . 
it got a big as scratch on it and almost on my screen . 
i do not see positive results yet either . 
my num_num month old loves when i turn it . 
this is the loudest  small  fan i ve ever heard . 
get a whistle with a cork ball that sounds like a whistle . 
there were probably about half of these that weren t usable . 
even when i use heat ,  i get erratic results from this product . 
that would have impressed all those simpsons fans out there . 
i have a german shepherd and a cat . 
the strong vinyl smell does go away after airing out though . 
pellets are to big around and fit in the barrel way to tight . 
but he just doesn t seem interested in the toy itself . 
it broke after a week and is unusable . 
i think that would have gone away eventually . 
sorry ,  there will be other games ,  this one s a ripoff . 
the handle is thin and feels a little awkward . 
you can also hear the headphones when they re not on you . 
or if the taste is some manufacturing chemical rather than the steel itself . 
none were near as pristine as in the picture . 
i loved the colors and the fabric looked great on line . 
they do not improve the condition of the skin whatsoever . 
these udon are a complete waste of time and money . 
this one needs to go back to the drawing board . 
you must then find num_num lilies ,  which takes another num_num minutes . 
and it s solid metal ,  not some cheap little ring . 
and i must say that i was totally disappoint with it . 
ordered for my son s mytouch and screen protector was way too big . 
i ve only used it about num_num times before that started . 
sorry ,  but i don t like it and wouldn t recommend this . 
i hate the fact i wasted money on this product . 
too many things you don t need in  hard  pills . 
i returned the game to gamestop as soon as i was able to . 
i had to throw this tea in the garbage . 
didn t even use it for more than a minute . 
i would buy it again if they changed the design of this part . 
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes . 
the case was very loose fitting and is not made well . 
however ,  the taste of this bar is absolutely vile . 
this game tends to be very hard since it requires precise timing . 
with return postage so expensive ,  i ll just eat the cost . 
which turns out to have been pretty smart thing to do . 
instead of optimizing the hdd ,  sony has cut it out . 
this shoe top layer is very hard and hurt my first num_num toes . 
maybe my little ugly beast is smarter than i thought she was . 
but only half the cars on the track; a concern for some . 
there are no holes or connections on the carrier itself to do that . 
the only thing i do like about the orginalz vs . 
the actual screen protector that is advertised is really really good . 
i have better things to do than scrub and clean . 
this is to teach your dog that click is a reward . 
if i sit right next to it i can feel a little heat . 
the rest will go to the next food bank drive ,  i guess . 
can t say i m a big fan of this toy . 
i ve been disappointed as i see no difference in behavioral at all . 
i really had high hopes for this ginger and lemon drink . 
whether i ll reorder ,  i don t know right now . 
she tried the strawberry applesauce ,  but found it too tart . 
this thing fell apart quickly and never really worked . 
i not sure what prompted me to buy it in the first place . 
i can t say it looks promising though . below are known issues . 
seems like the watch band is thicker so it s heavier . 
for little hands this becomes a difficult task . 
for one thing do not believe the  requiriments  given to play this game . 
we bought this item for our handicapped dog . 
there is still stuff floating around the bottom part too . 
never got the chance to use the pan . 
it takes cheap shots at president george w . 
on my phone at least the launcher is not handling things well . 
the unit was intended for a master suite . 
other than my complaints about the detail ,  everything else is nice . 
trying to get my golden to stop drinking out of the pool . 
i m sure it is great for younger women . 
the balls also don t really come out except for num_extend
i had to throw it out it dried up so quickly . 
i called eucerin and they said this product is not  opthamologist tested  . 
but i ll sum them up for num_extend the game freezes constantly . 
i made it tonight with some vegetables and it pretty much ruined dinner . 
not consistent and didn t give me the results i needed . 
i m embarrassed to have spend more than a dollar for them . 
i was looking num_extend num_num playing this collection only num_num b very disappointed . 
i was excited to try these ,  as they get rave reviews . 
i was tired of the crappy blenders not blending up the ice thoroughly . 
too bad ,  these are not bad looking ,  they are just garbage . 
other reviewers can be better reporters than i can . 
i rented this and ended up just watching and not playing . 
i have returned the unit and decided not to rebuy the same thing . 
sony gave it a good try but the game is too frustrating . 
the only place that sells the bowls is the neater feeder site . 
yuck !  also ,  if you are worried at all about gratutitous cursing . 
it wasn t exceptional and only sat num_num feet away . 
i hate the grooming procedure as much as they do . 
what a mess !  seemed like i almost made it through installation . 
it also muffled the ringtones in a weird way . 
it is too tiny for holding a phone . 
boy was i wrong ,  all of the games are pretty bad . 
otherwise ,  please feel free to get some assistance . 
i bought this to enable me to charge without having my computer running . 
i feel deceived and wish i could have my money back . 
the design of this product is pretty weak for the following num_extend
this game got boring within num_num minutes of playing it . 
if it were $ i would say buy it . 
she has never chewed on it even when she was a puppy . 
also ,  mirror snaps off too easily during adjustments . 
received from ccmaccessories more than a week before projected date . 
strange ,  not unlike the plain peach flavor i sampled the other day . 
however ,  my skin all over started to become irritatingly dry . 
they have no adhesiveness beyond static cling to a paper backing . 
there is nothing to secure this to the grill . 
this does not feel at all like a moisturizer . 
i d get something different for educational and listening skills . 
num_num if you don t count the time she sniffed at it . 
i ve found that my hair can t tolerate it alone . 
i followed the directions and pushed the food down the smaller feed tube . 
does not look like a high quality piece of silver . 
they told me the container i bought was manufactured in march num_extend
i bought this during the intro discount price; now more $
and i couldn t get anything done about it . 
it s pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing . 
but ,  my forehead and neck showed some improvement . 
i like the color ,  and it came out great . 
this cover did not fit my verizon iphone . 
ended going with platronics legend and love it . 
i have been using this for a while . 
he s not any worse but not any better either . 
the motor generates a nasty smell that is like burning rubber or grease . 
recently tried strydexin and so far works great . 
it s not long enough and it s terribly dull . 
expensive is not better in the case of this pitcher . 
i d recommend looking elsewhere for convoluted foam or this chair pad . 
unfortunately ,  after num_num months ,  it is really falling apart . 
i wanted to get a insole to support my flat shoes . 
i can t get this thing to stick to my tile shower wall . 
the back is bright orange while the front is a mild orange color . 
we got this for christmas and never use it . 
they all seem to be either hit or miss with me . 
lenmark num_extend also will not recharge even though the phone says it is . 
the wire for your ear can be adjusted to fit . 
but these products are totally not for people with fine hair . 
i can only safely recommend the chocolate varieties . 
i pumped it one more time and it finally gave me actual lotion . 
it is no larger than one aa battery . 
this game was an absolute waste of my time and money . 
i returned it for a refund immediately with no issues . 
did not use the products . day num_extend little irritation remaining . 
at best this headset purchase will be a crap shoot . 
i m going to start looking for a better device . 
he refuses to do tricks for this treat . 
something really needs to be done here . i love madden . 
if you like challenging games ,  this might be for you . 
i do not like the way it leaves my hair feeling . 
on top of that these are very thin fabric . 
and started carrying it in the pouch in my pocket . 
i can t believe i spent over $ on this !  . 
it did not preform like the original battery . 
it was a little work to put together but not much . 
the picture doesn t represent what the ring actually looks like . 
you too ? they were my morning treat in the service . 
i ordered a another one because the first planner was so convenient . 
paba free; it must spell out on the face of the num_extend
it still won t let me take any pictures though . 
we both took turns ,  and immediately knew which was which . 
the ad stated that the dvd was in wide screen anamorphic format . 
get the one that has auto fan if it senses heat . 
i guess they see dollar signs for nexus num_num owners . 
all of the moves are kick ,  punch ,  rage . 
it smelled okay but it has a little alcohol smell . 
i couldn t wait to run home and try it . 
you know what ?  you need a super computer to play this game . 
right now i have a headache from using it in regular light . 
i know there are chemicals that are not safe within this product . 
when these first came out ,  i thought they were great . 
think german shepherd with the legs lopped off . 
i bought these to try out after hearing about these from my friend . 
the hologram wasn t the same as the oem battery . 
this product overheats when charging more than one device . 
it will take six to eight weeks to replace it . 
for the rest of us it just doesn t cut it . 
dollars ,  it was an expensive piece of junk . 
the pinball action is simple yet works pretty well . 
the salmon is bland ,  barely pink and just not tasty . 
sorry but don t get it unless you wanna blow num_num bucks . 
i will continue my search for the right color . 
i can t get a refund as ups shows it as delivered . 
i researched like crazy and came across this top coat . 
it works fine and seems to be built well . 
the description for this cable says ,  oem by samsung . 
i was really excited for knights of the old republic num_num sith lords . 
i think it will still work for that . 
at first ,  i felt like returning the princess puppet . 
those who use the old design know what i m talking about . 
this trash is going back as soon as usp come to get it . 
so i had to use the letter opener to pry the thing open . 
quite frankly ,  we think this soup is disgusting . 
i would think twice if your interested in purchasing . 
i gave to num_num cats and dog and didn t work . 
the graphics are ok ,  but the gameplay is slow . 
this scope had num_num serious problems as num_extend
it s not the most beautiful shade of gold . 
i have to say that i am new to the world of hummingbirds . 
how can it be advertised as cotton when it is not ?  . 
please do yourself a favor and never buy these pellets . 
it did not hold up like i had expected . 
i buy these because i dont want my kids drinking out of plastic . 
in the meantime ,  i ll stick to blue sky . 
turns out to be a common problem with units sold before jan num_extend
buy the focusrite interface or one of the others . 
yeah ,  i wore these one day and threw them away . 
however ,  it doesn t tell you much of anything . 
this mirror distorted images and i couldn t see anything . 
everything else is pretty much terrific about the box . 
this  splitter  will not work for that function . 
this is a terrible product that is of poor design . 
please don t buy unless you want to get raped or ripped off . 
had to go elsewhere to find a replacement . 
but other than that it was a really cool case . 
it did once ,  long enough for me to add a few games . 
it wouldn t shut up no matter what i did with it . 
the comparisons of this to a medicine are pretty apt . 
ok i agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste . 
he would play with it all day if i let him . 
note that i was never actually touching the other character . 
the trimmer attachment keeps falling as it holder does not hold it well . 
i love keen shoes and own several pair . 
this is just a gimmicky ,  frustrating ,  piece of plastic . 
im taking this regularly but im not really sure if its working . 
then after a couple weeks it started to make terrible noises . 
the num_extend franchise mode is woefully inadequate . for num_extend
it fit the phone pretty good and offered good protection . 
i used to really like this creamy body lotion . 
that chrome bezel that looks so pretty in the picture . 
it was what was suggested when i bought my grooming table on amazon . 
when the answer came in it was complex . 
either way ,  very disappointing and would not recommend this toy . 
i have had calimyrna figs before and know what to expect . 
i used it per the instructions and ants really didn t seem interested . 
my mom used natural instinct for many years until they changed their formula . 
chemicals ,  alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin . 
i only used this twice then threw it in the trash . 
definitely won t buy again ,  even though they are tasty . 
i am not sure if it is the charger or the earpiece . 
when this product did work it was shoddy at best . 
it didn t fit correctly and came off in about a week . 
not gonna happen ! i really ,  really wanted to like this soap . 
i will never ever try anything like this again . 
unfortunaltely an hour later one leg is gone . 
the envirements are vibrant and colorful ,  but nothing great . 
i also added pieces of styrofoam ,  a recommendation to help deter fighting . 
okay so it worked fine for a month . 
this hampers it . i would gladly sacrifice graphics for a good game . 
hopefully my son won t notice they are missing . 
be forewarned :  this syrup will not satisfy your chocolate craving . 
the ring that you use to focus them broke . 
as everyone else has said ,  this headset is complete junk . 
i have not been able to surf for longer than half an hour . 
cats want to eat it but have trouble with it . 
i have to use my nails or a pen . 
it does the trick ,  removes urine and poop scent . 
i also noticed the material was super scratchy . 
don t settle for cheap unless you have to . 
i think scotties would fit in that category . 
ended up damaging the watch band  no problem because a jeweler fixed it  . 
if there is a toy hell ,  this puppy belongs there . 
i suppose that it is likely for problems to arise with tadpoles . 
i tried it in two different cars on two different phones . 
this wouldn t have been a big deal if not for num_num things . 
it did not go on the way i thought it should . 
there are better natural options out there if you need a beauty soap . 
it would irregularly cycle on and off once every couple of minutes . 
i got these today and was immediately disappointed . 
in my grocery store the stevia in the raw was cheaper . 
amazon was great about the return as usual . 
saying this drink has  no sugar added  is a bit disingenuous . 
also too low of a cut in the toe area . 
however ,  this was not upto the quality that i expected . 
so you cant tighten it and it come loose when you use it . 
all the adaptors were too large for my faucet . 
so my initial thought was that there were too many parts already . 
i love other nioxin products ,  but this one is useless . 
i didn t even sit on the device or drop it on anything . 
they are simply translucent so as to allow light to pass through . 
notice my dogs eyes were getting worst after using this product . 
the more light you have ,  the better your picture will be . 
the pan i got from amazon was made in china . 
i would send it back if i hadn t tossed the packaging . 
the card board piece are all over the place when cats start using . 
amazon has a similar but newer model available for purchase . 
i m very disappointed and am returning this item . 
i have to admit that i was previously spoiled . 
i have purchased num_num of these through amazon . 
perhaps i should have gone for a plastic version . 
gelish is rather hard to remove and i like cnd products better . 
please research this before letting your child ingest it . 
i have used maybelline products for a while now . 
just put it in a box and never use it . 
you get what you pay for with this cord . 
took a long time to get and the color is not appealing . 
it went straight back in the box and back to amazon . 
our english bulldog loved this toy and chased it all over . 
i have used this mixer for num_num years or so . 
i bought this to replace my seche vite . 
i tested them a few days after receiving them in the mail . 
i check amazon reviews with fervor and have found them very reliable . 
this stiff is all peely after you start rubbing it in . 
there are scuffs and dents on the plastic . 
i currently am using my oakleys  ,  they work great ,  but costly . 
cant say what wrong except they are cheaply made and feel like it . 
you re blocked from continuing down the beach by a fallen tree . 
i was very excited to find this product . 
tried a linksys usb card and it work great . 
this product is nothing like what i used to buy . 
tried this for canker sores in my mouth . 
this is a regular puffed cereal with vanilla flavor . 
just stay away from this pile of garbage . 
i honestly can t get over how terrible it is . 
it s not that i bought the wrong size . 
both claim num_num parts ,  but are not measuring up . 
on top of that ,  it made my nails peel . 
and apparently the cran actin wasn t the magic ingredient ,  either . 
you pay $ more than it is worth . 
you have to be very gentle with this thing . 
these may work for you ,  but i sure didn t enjoy them . 
new characters are added ,  some are great ,  some not so great . 
there is no actual evolution in this game . 
a lot of people think it is silly to get a pet dryer . 
might work for a small dog but not for a bigger dog . 
they refused to respond fearing that i would post my comments here . 
as of this writing ,  there is no microsoft approved windows xp driver . 
always charging and that s when i tested with a vtvm . 
sounds cool ,  right ? well ,  it would be if it worked . 
in a car it is nicer to have the headset . 
the fabric seems ok and the fit was good . 
the graphics are all cartoon ! moving around is another problem . 
why would anyone get this thing ?  i can t figure it out . 
and then u start over again ,  with the same stuff u had . 
when you don t touch any buttons nariko will block a  blue  attack . 
i shudder to think what could happen to a puppy . 
ironically i found an amazing short and super long one that work awesome . 
the headset operates best with the phone in sight . 
we returned this as it didn t work for compressions socks . 
thetrackman wheel has the ball under the thumb ,  whichis far more comfortable . 
i think i ve beaten the first game six or seven times . 
i don t even know where to begin with this game . 
had i received the item i ordered ,  the review would be higher . 
fine ,  i understand those little pieces of plastic won t last forever . 
i found that this was to gloopy for me . 
their golden is golden but not a fan of this version . 
however ,  the brew from the num_num was superb . 
normally i love hazelnut and figured chocolate hazelnut would be even better . 
they swell and cause the button to jam . 
putting on lotion or oil out of the shower . 
it rests right on their shoulder blades and rubs as they walk . 
please don t buy this you will regret it . 
i really needed a num_num port hub but this was not the solution . 
eventually the stuff gets eaten ,  but they much prefer tetra pond . 
i have two cats and neither was interested in this toy . 
it also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora . 
so in retroscpect i would give this player a num_num star rating . 
basil doesn t seem to go with split pea soup . 
otherwise this scrub was good and definitely made my face lighter and brighter . 
you should also be doing crunches at this stage . 
how about something stronger that mimics the steel primer ?  . 
neither would the little charging case that came with it . 
still ,  sellers shouldn t force buyers to scrutinize their marketing tricks . 
this creme just didn t work for my hair type at all . 
i m finished doling out money for this piece of garbage . 
there is no more objectives in this game . 
this pink switcheasy case for iphones is not that great to look at . 
it didn t work even after i charged it num_num hours . 
i washed my hair with nexxus shampoo and conditioner as usual . 
if i could give it num_extend star i would . 
personally i am not a big fan of this product . 
my home is new and i have a sophisticated structured wiring system . 
to turn off ,  you need to take out the batteries . 
they will look every bit as good as these . 
oh well ,  it was as advertised so my bad . 
my iphone num_extend from sprint fits perfectly and it is very secure . 
i filed a complaint with amazon and they sent a replacement . 
the colors are great and it is a durable product . 
the colors of my neon dwarf rainbows have never looked so vibrant . 
maybe i like this toy more than my toddler does . 
i paid $ and will never waste money on another calphalon again . 
hair directly under the nose is noticably longer than at the lip . 
if anything ,  this made our miniature dachshund run the other way . 
with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp . 
second was that the handles and cup holders were reinforced . 
we have hardwood floors and it is not steady . 
we ve changed the batteries and checked the connections and nothing works . 
for me ,  the tunecast is useless and never worked satisfactorily . 
i decided to order fertilaid and bought three bottles  three months  worth . 
like most other reviews say ,  this mouse jumps around constantly . 
nowhere does it give you what memory card capability it has . 
my husband got this in october num_num num_extend months ago  . 
argan oil comes after fragrance on the ingredient list . 
everything else i would actually buy something else . 
bought this to use with my iphone num_extend
i bought this item for my dog to play with . 
i personally think that it is horribly overpriced for the quality and workmanship . 
the allure of ping pals comes from the customization of the chat experience . 
it is too hard to open and grab the blower . 
it was extremely shiny and free of tangles and frizz . 
this particular brand didn t last but about a month . 
these signals seem to bleed across all the fm band . 
reading reviews i bought this bra for the lift and support . 
will keep them near the computer ,  but not for long term use . 
i did not like this product at all . 
i can t just step on the scale and have them work . 
although they are also slightly lower protein as well . 
you use them on easy ,  they never win a single minigame . 
i didn t even realize it at the time . 
i think the notes are floral but they smelled like plastic on me . 
no chunks of the vehicle ,  no fragments of metal ,  just . 
besides ,  i felt that this is too greasy for my liking . 
the materials that this aerator was manufactured from ,  were worthless . 
it had a strange flavor that just didn t appeal to me . 
moreover i have found themotor to be poor . 
first it is too sweat due to too much stevia added . 
i threw it away after trying to use it a few times . 
the latch is also hard plastic and simply pops back open every time . 
my favorite styling putty was discontiued and that was tresemme . 
i purchased my kitchenaid professional num_num limited edition about num_num months ago . 
these things are burning our right and left . 
the axe is very nice and appears to be an excellent axe . 
thank goodness for amazon prime that allows quick returns and refunds . 
not worth the hassle and cost to return . 
these were very tight shoulder to shoulder and short at the waist line . 
i have to give credit to the very first reviewer on this . 
this is the worse model water jet i have ever owned . 
don t kid yourself like i did !  !  i definitely regret it . 
my game came without the product code required for activation . 
it smelled good but i don t usually num_extend
the banana is barely any longer than the onion is wide . 
these won t be back on the shelf at my house again . 
i used plenty of coffee ,  so that is not the problem . 
so i did that ,  and then tried it in my evo . 
it worked after i bent the lips out . 
this was the first blood rayne for the num_extend
i bought this set to use with my tv . 
advise you go one size up at least . 
however ,  it s quick release plate is anything but . 
the time it takes to locate cars takes your attention off the road . 
this broke me out in the worse way . 
i am getting more and more discouraged with amazon  reviewers  . 
three of the tools are no broken after one use . 
my throat tingled for an hour after eating the bar . 
this is what i get for trying to economize . 
i would only buy it as a practical joke . 
it s going back and i ll look for another . 
maybe i can find another use for them . 
smells like a placenta facial from years ago .  .  . disgusting . 
as another reviewer noted ,  cooking can be amusing . 
this stuff smells like roasted potatoes because of the rosemary extract . 
i will try this again when i m headed outside for several hours . 
however ,  the handle squeeze is much too hard to do . 
first of ,  let s start with the technical goof ups . 
yeah ,  i thought these were going to be % whole wheat . 
the one i ordered from wireless hub ,  brooklyn ,  ny worked immediately . 
led indicators show low battery charge . i do not trust it . 
i much prefer the bombay potatoes and jaipur vegetables . 
i shouldn t have given it to my dad . 
i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound . 
too much of a chance it will slip out of my hand . 
it s dusty ,  heavy ,  and cements itself to the box . 
i ll probably never bother to finish this game . 
this product is rubberized and the colored band around is made of plastic . 
i doubt it will survive another power disruption . 
the item as received did not resemble the pictured item . 
the plastic around the jack has also cracked . 
the first worked for the first two uses . 
by going by the pictures this looked much bigger then it actually is . 
i am using a large air pump with it and nothing works . 
you get what you pay for ,  i guess !  . 
i m trying to retun the item for a refund . 
so disappointed ,  and seriously want a refund on it . 
the gba tries its best to capture the essence of tekken and crashes . 
the interface is the worst i ve ever seen in a video game . 
it was dropped on our tile floor and the handle broke off . 
you may be surprised to find holes and lots of mold inside . 
i guess i should have purchased it from a local store . 
the instructions are missing and sent in a flimsy envelope . 
she took a couple of sips and threw the rest out . 
the num_extend phone service is not necessary for phone calls or texting . 
we chatted with apple support numerous times to no avail . 
they hid the anise disclosure in the other flavorings listing without naming it . 
i like them because they protect the phone while being minimally intrusive . 
it just refused to stick or apply to lashes . 
i have used these exact gloves for years . 
maybe i have a different kind of algae . 
be aware that this product is useless without one of the lowepro waistbelts . 
definitely a game to rent first before you buy . 
i m wasting too much time waiting for the game . 
this is the num_extend identical switch to fail . 
the unit we received may have been defective . 
the shoes ordered were not the correct size . 
not only this thing is way overprice ,  it is no diet food . 
if i could return a used product i would . 
this product kept my hair looking great all day . 
blue jean is also good ,  but they are still a bit pricey . 
maybe it s not meant for my skin type . 
it is also hard to put the food in the littleslot . 
but i still don t recommend for the reasons in the first paragraph . 
you can definitely find better ones out there . 
i tested the unit and it does work . 
and ,  that was about the end of it . 
okay i love indy racing and i was upset with this game . 
might work great if your dog never chews . 
this case was extremely hard to get off and i would not recommend . 
plus it toppled over easily when she would bounce on it . 
they are very cheap looking and they feel that way as well . 
needless to say ,  we are not at all happy . 
environmental fail . i put this in my own tank sprayer . 
she loved it though !  i m glad it made someone happy . 
i didn t like the texture of the drink at all . 
i would not recommend this model given how  much it costs  !  . 
plastic and its faux leather is the thickness of a dollar store condom . 
two summers ago i was so excited to get this . 
that s the only way i d recommend this shirt . 
two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets . 
it feels like it doesn t really penetrate your hair . 
this cable only works for sync with my ipad . 
instead ,  i paid ten bucks for a useless hunk of plastic . 
i think that this powder didnt come in the color it shows . 
the connectors are solid and i had no issues . 
my dog nearly choked on the polyester stuffing inside . 
wish i would have ground meat more while it was returnable . 
i wasn t at all impressed with the product . 
i don t like righting a num_num star review . 
get an aftermarket that costs much much less . 
a very cheaply made undersized piece of junk . 
the story is good and the battle system is great !  . 
i needed a cheap microphone for a spanish class i m taking . 
now two weeks later it makes a constant hum . 
i have owned this unit for over a year now . 
touch screen keyboards have been around for ever . 
it worked for a little over a year before it died . 
my son doesn t play with this much at all . 
it had a metallic taste a little like some medicine from my childhood . 
but after washing my face they looked the same . 
sony has managed to manufacture a dvd player that will not play dvds . 
generally it can get more oily at the roots . 
the charger may be real samsung but the holograms was missing . 
i try all of the new toys for her . 
this would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game . 
but i still can t believe just how bad they are . 
be prepared to spend alot of time and frustration in getting any results . 
i have no idea how quinoa should taste . 
the game is challenging ,  but much better to play . 
the bottle says in small letters to refrigerate  after purchase  . 
but they are far from realistic ,  they have a very bright feel . 
i accidently ordered one that was acceptable rather than like new . 
sorry ,  model one ,  i wanted to like you !  . 
i really would recomend not wasteing your money on this . 
hard to believe they took this to market !  . 
we love and drink swiss miss products with great frequency . 
i have a male and a female cat . 
they re not prime . i ordered these things on june num_extend
weeks later :  well ,  i ll add to this again . 
it contains much of what you already have . 
i m not taking points off for that though ,  just mentioning it . 
don t wast your money on this crappy game . 
i m going to look for a sturdier one this time around . 
she asked me to hold and then forward me to another department . 
the stickers were extremely sharp on the sides . 
they reformulated and dumped a load of soy flour into this cake mix . 
the shovel leavers are designed and perform exceptionally well . 
if you are legit ,  than this cautionary statement shouldn t bother you . 
this is the worst quality paracord i have every purchased . 
i m still using this thing but don t recommend it . 
i had used these before and needed one for a quick scuba trip . 
i bought this a year and a half ago . 
even considering that ,  the game is really bad . 
my num_extend defender case fits great !  i like the atomic green color . 
my son was num_num years old when i got this for him . 
i ve been using hydrometers for over num_num years . 
for $ who cares ,  these are fine disposables . 
i bought this case because i wanted something more sturdy for my phone . 
my first pda was the palm viix and i had their portable keyboard . 
plus this treat is practically nothing but sugar . 
and every one of the replacements cracked in one or two uses . 
especially considering the price ,  i think it s highly overrated . 
i hoped that the new game would respond better to mouse clicks . 
one other downside is that the buttons are harder to press . 
it let me down and is now no longer functional . shame . 
he climbs a wall with his hands and thats it . 
it sounds like i am listening a radio station num_num miles away . 
i have other products that work as well or better than this product . 
this coffeemaker made great coffee every morning for about num_num months . 
i tried this because of the great reviews i read . 
but sadly ,  the vtech website says they re out of stock . 
when it came in the mail it only had num_num flavors . 
supposed to be a num_extend amp usb num_extend adapter . 
thanks for reading !  i hope this review was helpful . 
no chance . the quality of the bag is fine . 
linksys appears to be riding on their reputation . 
the sound garbles badly and the battery runs out within an hour . 
i ordered this product in winter ,  so no worries about the heat . 
it was used for less than num_num minutes . 
you need to keep the cord stable to get good sound . 
this one really is lacking in the flavor department . 
stay with the tried and true glass measuring cups . 
i could not turn on the phone at all . 
because of this ,  it is a pretty terrible business phone . 
i understand the extras and upgrades sites have . 
i wear a size num_num in skinny jeans . 
i can describe it now as similar to an inflammatory reaction . 
i just propped it up the best i could on the top rack . 
i literally swam in it in the smallest size . 
then i need to recharge them which takes another two hours . 
i m sending it back before i hurt someone . 
can t get much more  con  than that i guess . 
my ratng is not actually fair ,  i know . 
these get much thinner towards the trigger than traditional stocks . 
but the construction is what you expect for the price . 
but ,  i would not buy this for any serious network . 
a flawed game no doubt ,  but a good one nevertheless . 
i found these beans to be nothing special . 
the game had promise ,  but needed about another year of development . 
the disappointing part is that the clips don t hold my hair . 
if you need an ice cream or cookie scoop ,  get something else . 
this case doesn t even fit the phone !  so it s useless . 
only output is analog . the ugly is that you are intentionally deceived . 
it makes the wagon difficult to pull ,  steer ,  and noisy . 
do yourself a favor and pass on these . 
i love your company ,  and most of your products . 
i was just expecting more for my money . 
these are a sugar free ,  starburst like candy in crystal light flavors . 
once again ,  some of the cd s started skipping . 
i got this when he was a num_num month old puppy . 
too much money for too short a play time . 
that s not because excel  or this camera  is awkwardly designed . 
we monitored him for num_num hours after ,  with no further consequences observed . 
they should have made these with more ginger . 
the sizing was accurate but not worth the money at any price . 
only there was no music coming out of the player at all . 
the one i received has the  ruby coated  lens . 
so instead of returning the  feeder  ,  i filled it again . 
i am in agreement that it is  chemically  and cloningly sweet . 
it looked different then the caler on the photo on amazon . 
they seem well made but the sizing is really off . 
they are tight ,  hard and there is no flex to the sole . 
i tried but my senior cat would not even eat these . 
this warmer only warms the middle of the mattress leaving the sides cold . 
short cable to link to digital converter or tv . 
i took about num_extend shots of the skyline of seattle . 
other than that it is a great vacuum for the price . 
u can get a rubber one for num_num bucks at a hardware store . 
however it is not bright enough for night riding . 
bought this product to get the pile of puzzles off the floor . 
i found out that the one i order was a counterfeit item . 
all in all ,  i dont reccomend this game . 
i had high hopes for this face cream because of the reviews . 
in the meantime ,  i m going to borrow a friends rug shampooer . 
while it is  deluxe  it isn t that great . 
not sure why the name is  crinkle  when there is no crinkle !  . 
it did not improve signal strengh at all . 
there are other ,  more quality ,  options out there . 
will keep updated as to how reebok handled this problem . 
messed around a bit and it started to work . 
so ,  for me ,  it was a waste of money . 
i have oiler lids and this just seems to intensify the oil . 
its a nice bag ,  just not large enough . 
i received item very fast and in good condition . 
less than one star for this piece of . 
i liked the charger ,  the plastic and metal and how they sit . 
my cats have been eating this canned kitten cat food for several years . 
alas they don t work for my num_num oz cans !  . 
num_extend they are made of the ugliest ,  cheapest plastic you can imagine . 
you can buy a nice rollator with seat for $ more . 
expected it to be made in the usa . 
earthquake belongs to the greek and totally destroys every building in an area . 
i hope my birds forgive me for the extra garbage in their food . 
i gave it two stars for appearance ,  color and padding . 
i am severely disappointed and surprised about this . 
there are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there . 
of coffee into the trash bin since it is not returnable . 
in reality after num_num hours it was not making any noise at all . 
the little creamers end up cracking and opening during transit . 
this headset worked well for only num_num month before the problems began . 
i bought num_num of them for num_num the optimus vs my family owns . 
i also found it too heavy to use easily . 
i especially noticed this when i cooked chicken breasts and italian sausages . 
ordered two ,  and the both acted funny when i got them . 
way overpriced ,  hard to put on ,  cracks pretty easily . 
my only problem is i lost it somewhere while i was shopping . 
but i feel it should have been better . 
they taste good but everything turns to crumbles . 
oz but it is not there is no give at all . 
they are subject to minimal wear and this should not be happening . 
this game is barely a shadow of what spyro is supposed to be . 
but i do like my new kitchenaid mixer better . 
my cat won t even give this a second glance . 
just not as exciting as i expected it to be . 
i found myself randomly pressing buttons just waiting for the adversaries to die . 
they made those goldfish cookies seem like yellow whales by comparison . 
moreover ,  ergonomically speaking ,  the handle is not ideal . 
in my environment  urban  i received no listenable shortware channels at all . 
the main power switch actuates but does not turn on the power . 
also ,  soft mats slip around way too much . 
i followed every recommendation on the net to prevent interference to no avail . 
i shrugged it off and let it alone again . 
now i have these small tubes that i can t even use . 
i suppose you get what you pay for . 
it has a potent aftertaste and a grainy texture . 
purchased these for my son for swim team based on the reviews . 
picture is a little deceptive as they are more like birthday party favors . 
i really miss nobuo uematsu s music in this series . 
i d recommend their smaller grip extension for the num_extend
the knob on the lid broke in num_num weeks for me too . 
just make sure it s an optical one instead of a mechanical one . 
the clip that comes with it does not fit well on her clothes . 
i found a kcup of it in an assortment i also purchased . 
i read somewhere that they re now made in china . 
thank you however ,  for this crappy tasting snack . 
i will follow up with any new information . 
they are not good quality and are a waste of money . 
i am very careful about what products i put on my face . 
the iphone num_num screen has a subtle edge or lip around the glass . 
sponges supplied are scratchy and not usable on a child s face . 
it barely works unless you are clipping it to thin material . 
there s plenty of length it s just too tight in the toe . 
the graphics and video experience as a whole is lovely . 
however ,  it did not fit any of my pots . 
i don t see how this can be considered french roast . 
also when dispensing ,  the eye makeup remover splattered out in several directions . 
being the first nikon product i have owned ,  i was not impressed . 
also the midranges ,  specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced . 
also did not include micro usb charger which was included in the description . 
these made a racket in my cd burner before ejecting . 
i will return it to the store and get something more stable . 
i thought the bra looked sexy for what its worth . 
you might want to wait until engineers redesign it . 
first one that i owned broke after num_num uses . 
it has packs num_num calories in a little over num_num oz . 
keep looking if you have that phone so you won t be disappointed . 
nice for an area where you only need a little bit of light . 
two or three chicken breasts will fill this one to capacity . 
my family eats pizza at least once a week . 
this is by far the worse cd i ever used . 
i prefer coffee made in a french press . 
i expected more for a brand like camelback . 
and i wanted them all to be easy to access . 
it sits to my right about num_num ft away from my chair . 
could have returned but for the price it was not worth the time . 
i normally wear tennis shoes everywhere for any occasion . 
this stool was very stable for the first couple of months . 
my neighbor liked this shoe for zumba ,  so i ordered a pair . 
we have the sleeping beauty set too and it has the same problem . 
this game has terrible gameplay ,  terrible controls ,  and terrible cutscenes . 
then didnt charge at all after a week so yeah its junk . 
the flavor was ok but each piece was a real challenge to eat . 
it was a very cheaply made knock out . 
it s too easy to get frustrated and bored with this game . 
 and it raises questions about any warranty they may offer on this .   . 
our son is mildly autistic and the screeching noise really bothers his ears . 
the two stars are for the service it was good . 
but now i know and we tried it . 
i got num_num months service from these headphones they just have stopped working . 
those stairs are made from plastic pieces that pop together quite easily . 
which leads to the worst part about the game :  the storyline . 
this is just yet another example where microsoft products are nothing but trouble . 
boo !  even diablo num_num had a story in there ,  somewhere . 
they sort of work but its easier and quicker to use a knife . 
this headset was a waste of money and time . 
they are very pretty and it is a shame they are so thin . 
this is not a real deal just a fake number . 
he does like it ,  but hubby and i were very disappointed . 
voice a call from my contact list of from a spoken number . 
the rubber strap is not very comfortable either . 
any reviews with one or two stars on this is correct . 
so basically i pay more for the replacement than the original one . 
i went back to the otterbox for better protection . 
he is persistent and gnawed this toy into pieces pretty quickly . 
this might be better for an older kid around num_num or so . 
quality control for this company is very poor . 
i like braun products generally ,  but this is a dud . 
look at the profile of the ear pieces . 
wow did i have high hopes for this . 
the regular one conditioner works better and detangles hair . 
an hour later and a few modifications i got it to fit . 
ok first i must say this will install on a num_extend gen . 
num_extend cm at least num_num adhesive bandages ,  num_num in . 
which makes the  access card  ,  and spyderco which makes the  spydercard  . 
i had heard nothing but great reviews for resident evil num_extend
so instead of going left like i wanted to i vered right . 
i love my other eheim num_extend but not this one . 
the corners aren t finished as nicely as the first one either . 
but even at best all stations had all sorts of fuzz and dropouts . 
however ,  this feature was not worth $ should still get a num_extend
and you dont get enough sg  bullets  like their the rarest ammo to num_extend
but at the price ,  why waste your money . 
these are garbage and makes me suspect all motorola products going forward . 
it lacks the complexity of fragrances that are interesting . 
it is is not very sturdy at all !  . 
the material on these ear warmers is so thin and flimsy . 
does not provide very much volume or length . 
both cats are not interested in even trying it . 
they advertise  genuine issue  ,  but what i got was a chinese copy . 
i tried it a couple of times just to makes sure . 
this one leaks like a sieve right under the buckle . 
plus there is no alyson to voice willow . 
the same problems occured in the second game . 
the other only lasted a month or so longer . 
the warrior is just not worth the price . 
i have not use because i am afraid it collapsed under high presion . 
about num_num minutes into the game the sound stopped working . 
it was very flimsy and the connection was flaky . 
the worse set of brushes i ve ever purchased . 
i just wish they came in bigger sizes !  . 
this worked at first ,  but then it became very finicky . 
also the base to carry it on charges the unit which is convenient . 
because of the bottom sole to the shoe not comfort walking in it . 
not only are they too short but they are also very narrow . 
my cat does love the flavor of it ,  though . 
the missions themselves are endless variations on the same themes . 
still had the pastic and box was sealed . 
i threw it out after thinking about it more . 
but this has got to be my least favorite . 
not to mention that the bullettime feature was somewhat improved . 
i could only get num_num corners into the case . 
you mix them together to activate the ingredients . 
i was soo disappointed in the watch s looks . 
buy the powder version of annie s rice mac and cheese instead . 
it clumps into a mass and scoops out easily . 
the old style snap traps got the mouse . 
there is constant  hiss  ,  even at very low volume . 
he loves racing cars and he loves shooting them down ramps . 
there were some num_num steps i had to go through after upgrading . 
he would throw stuff until i turned attention from the baby to him . 
this one was maybe for an older ,  more careful child . 
so i m sticking with the num_extend until something changes with them . 
$ do not recommend that anyone bother to purchase this pad . 
hello , i had to return this product because it did not work . 
currently am waiting for a replacement drive from seagate . 
however my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen . 
after it arrived ,  i took it out of the box . 
after the first year one of the tips broke off . 
didn t work and now i can t get it off . 
i followed all the instructions carefully but this thing is just bad . 
i have had nothing but trouble with it . 
the plastic frame is quite brittle and thin in critical areas . 
perhaps mixed with other ingredients ie for no bake cookies . 
oh my god i wanted to jump under a bus playing this game . 
do not buy a canon camera with num_extend problems !  . 
they are still very salty ,  but also very tough hard as well . 
i m on my third replacement pump in num_num years . 
i have a sweatshirt in large that is bigger then this xtra large . 
the grip would spin as i shot the weapon . 
waterfall mist is the best and moisturizing for natural num_extend hair . 
dropped my phone and it cracked in a million and one pieces . 
the audio quality is bad and its echoing during calls . 
my wife could see my butt in them . 
to be very well built until one assembles the wheels . 
in about half an hour !  not allowed to pause it for some num_extend
what happened to isotoner ?  they were good years ago . 
perhaps there are people out there who really enjoy that . 
with several backyard chickens ,  our garage is a host for little mice . 
ended up throwing the last two bottle away . 
if you are african american this wont work for you . 
no educational value ,  not much fun ,  and frustrating to work with . 
it happened to me and i m still traumatized . 
if you are looking for some color ,  go darker . 
perhaps a tabasco lover looking for something a little different . 
it is terrible on your skin ,  or atleast it was on mine . 
prehaps i can wire this up to a dimmer switch or something . 
some people actually toss their pennies because their bulk betrays their value . 
after a few uses ,  i am operating on autopilot . 
they are hard to get on straight and want stay on . 
i love flavored coffees ,  but this one is just nasty . 
you must unplug it immediately after you pour  if you have memory lapses  . 
resident evil zero did not live up to its hype . 
but they have exacuted them very well lately . 
i bought it from a store and at that time it was around $
my complaints match many of those detailed by the other negative reviews . 
would have given it num_num stars if reliability was not an issue . 
i got this for my son for christmas . 
the product is great depending on your hair type . 
no way to adjust or repair it either . 
i bought this for my num_num year old . 
you don t swing the sword around at all . 
this guy has found the bottom of my range bag . 
i loved being able to spray my own olive oil onto the pan . 
made me feel really  weird  after a few days . 
i found the taste to be lacking and a bit bitter . 
perhaps the lack of gluten was what bothered me . 
it worked okay for a while but eventually the transmitter just quit transmitting . 
his is about a year old and warped . 
it also took over a month to arrive . 
you cannot lay this thing down without bubbles . 
it still takes rather decent pictures when there is enough light . 
i eat a healthy diet ,  whole fresh ,  unprocessed foods . 
also ,  this incident has made me more aware of pet food . 
i tried constant stirring ,  but even that didn t help . 
needless to say ,  they went straight into the trash . 
the color is also very different from the picture . 
you can play by yourself or with a friend in versus mode .

i don t know really why these diapers don t work for us . 
then i noticed that the tracks seems to be make num_num different ways .

it was the same with the gratiae eye cream . 
i read in the reviews that the quality was not the same . 
i bought this product ,  used the prduct by following the direction . 
i like it ,  it feels good and exfoliates well . 
i wasn t expecting miracles though i did keep an open mind . 
they are half the power of the logitech s and num_extend more expensive . 
oh ,  and all the pics are stored as bmp files . 
as prior reviews state ,  the icicles fall right off . 
it s a little heavy ,  but that doesn t really bother me . 
i do like the after shave lotion though . 
maybe my projector doesn t provide the power like it should . 
my unit works only plugged ,  so the battery is dead . 
i use to give my pets these and they loved them .

after about an hour or two a part in the dress riped . 
my scalp though still feels irritated by the product .

the right channel audio level decreased significantly below that of the left channel .

way to dangerous for me to ever do that . 
i don t recommend it and i won t buy it again . 
the mouse does not move on my hard wood num_extend
better to just buy full price charger instead of crap products . 
the mission layouts don t really augment your experience or juice up imaginations . 
upgrade the motor so it can actually pull the trains and additional cars . 
this is the most irratating system for turn based battle in my opinion . 
i always read other reviews when purchasing items . 
whoa iam very surprised by this heaping pile of plastic . 
that is one of the best sleeping bag designs i have ever seen .

the bread is always heavy and doesn t rise enough . 
it just makes an already bad speaker louder . 
my first bottle of this was my last bottle . 
spend a little extra to get a rubber set . 
i m not going to return them for the small price i paid . 
of course ,  wear some month or year ,  it can be happen . 
some will love it ,  others won t like it at all . 
it s certainly not as good as some purport it to be . 
a serious must have with an evo user . 
compared to this grinder my earlier one was much superior . 
i ve had several other water fountains and have liked them much better . 
unfortunately ,  my applications are apparently no more conventional than their possessor . 
really frustrating to take out on fresh snow . 
this radio is junk for me and i am returning it .

really bad battery life ,  connection was lost more often that i liked . 
i had better results with the glytone toner . 
keep it clean and i would say it works if rite from factory . 
i may have just gotten a bad one . 
graphically ,  this game is definitely an early gen game . 
i don t like this dumb game at all . 
i wouldnt even mind the smell of it if it would work . 
so this does seem the more pure cheese route . 
they were actually num_extend caliber snap caps with num_extend caliber label . 
ecotools is always highly rated with their cosmetic brushes ,  for example . 
needless to say ,  this was a total waste of money .

i finished it ,  and anxiously awaited the sequel . 
worth about a buck fifty .  .  . will not buy again . 
but in the future i plan to buy from vitacost .

the insurmountably erratic wireless performance is what drove me bonkers . 
sloping the seat means you cannot sit on it . 
applying foundation over it is quite tricky ,  even when waiting num_num minutes .

make sure your camera is really really light or it will fall over .

but it s for the living room ,  and maxes out . 
although the menu looks a lot like it . 
it only picked up the poop ,  and not all of it . 
the last try was a four pound evenchicken we managed to find . 
on the highest quality it approaches oblivion ,  almost but not quite . 
search the web for num_extend and you ll know what i mean . 
i just had to find a work around for the outlet . 
the first flat eroded through the tire and caused the flat .

he loves toys that move ,  and he loves toys that constantly change .

so far we have not caught a single critter . 
the blade should of been razor sharp when i received it . 
i have had tca peels before ,  up to % with dramatic results . 
i bought two of these and they arrived yesterday . 
though it probably won t even work for that . 
this collar did absolutely nothing to prevent my dog from pulling . 
i would suggest that you buy a small sample . 
had to play only one session a week as it becomes extremely boring . 
this is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage . 
if anyone wants to help out i could use the help . 
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic . 
the uag gives your phone much more face depth protection .

i thought it was just my thumb but it happened several more times . 
not sure if they are closed over the weekend . 
that s not to say it won t work for you . 
i always test my gear and i was glad i did . 
water usually looks good and so does smoke . 
perhaps it s because of it s sleek brushed chrome design . 
but that could all change in a heart beat . 
i bought these for my small dogs and they seemed to like them . 
i regret buying these headphones; learn from my mistake . 
sucks when a product doesn t work as advertized . 
i tried these and i just didn t like them at all .

a second convenient bedside charger would be nice . 
more over one of the speaker stopped working just after two months . 
this is just a typical moisturizing serum and nothing more . 
but today i have to throw them out . 
the next one i replaced it with didnt work at all . 
allow me to say one more thing :  final fantasy vi gripped me . 
the soft cover comes off the phone very easy . 
do yourself a favour and avoid this dross . 
i also wrote a letter to the company . 
it makes more sense to just buy the accessories from apple . 
its very cheap and you can discover things like this . 
my dog had this chewed up in a few minutes . 
oblivion stood out as a must have game .

or maybe it just never does get very bright . 
my husband and i like the other type that makes four large rolls . 
compared to real peanut butter ,  i don t like it . 
i recently rescued a cat and this is my first cat toy . 
these snap bracelets are not worth the money . 
the ai is also sometimes too hard ,  then just too easy . 
this is a very satisfactory kitchen trash bag . 
however ,  this game is just a piece of garbage . 
so i guess i just had a bad part . 
out of num_num throws u might get it to stick twice ,  maybe . 
guess  i got what i paid for with this one  . 
nothing will take the shine off riding like a poorly fitting bicycle . 
it also says it needs a minimum of num_extend  hxwxl  room to fly . 
i ll save it for scrubbing walls or something . 
the old version maintained heat for more than a num_num minute duration .

first of all ,  this is no leave in . 
the story begins with part of the japanese landscape gone to hell . 
some of them where unsuitable to be shot and had to be discarded . 
i d give this a zero rating if i could . 
if you want a better game for less price ,  then buy starcraft . 
second the cut of the cover wasn t accurate on both samples . 
it has lots of static ,  and is not clear at all . 
they are very thin and bubble very easily . 
so ,  the tylan should work ,  but the value is not there . 
riboflavin num_extend and cyanocobalamin num_extend are created during fermentation .

the toy lacks vision as to what it s targeting .

i saw the eclipse system package and tried one out . 
having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying . 
opening the box it looked like it had already been num_extend
and the dust from the pills gets all over the screwing part .

the ai in realistic mode  the hardest mode  ,  is unrealistic . 
noise at anything above iso num_extend looks like num_extend
also ,  the sanitizer stopped working after a few months .

the metal mounting clips scratched the edges of my trunk lid . 
it gets a little bit off but not enough to make a difference . 
i had to send back didn t charge my iphone num_extend
yes ,  there are great freedom ,  but there are unintended consequences . 
they are also stretched out so they flop around a bit . 
the price and quality of apps there is very good . 
they were incredibly painful ,  and always resulted in a huge white head . 
it does have a back and front clear part for camera . 
i washed it off and decided to try again . 
as the symptoms passed ,  this too was very unpleasant . 
in theory ,  any bluetooth headset will work with a num_extend
maybei credit chrlorella and acai power berry cleanse for helping me heal . 
after about num_num mins they were not into it . 
taking my phone into them was a waste of time . 
so i ll sadly be returning it for a refund . 
to its credit there was no high fructose corn syrup in the bottle . 
it didn t stop them so i ordered this terro product . 
i stopped liking them when they eliminated butter . 
it was clear that blood was not passing through the exit wound . 
i ordered this for my son for christmas . 
i was using a steroid cream that got rid of the rash .

a griffin technology num_num amp powerjolt dual micro for iphone and ipod  black  . 
i am wearing them by themselves ,  and they are not yellowing either . 
then he started the timer and worked as fast as he could . 
you cannot play this game solo and reach anywhere . 
i like them however my kids perfer other bars . 
we went online and read all the wonderful reviews for this product . 
this does clean your face ,  but there is nothing magic about it . 
maybe this product wasn t meant for my type of curls ?  . 
they are not worth purchasing for the cost of shipping . 
but it was still uncomfortable and i could not feel . 
it s supposed to beep num_num times to active voice calling . 
like a lot of pretty things ,  it s uncomfortable . 
the taste of this coconut water is horrible ,  just horrible . 
replacing the screen was easier than i imagined . 
tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing . 
i went back to using a traditional litter box . 
num_num hours !  and it still didn t bleach all the way . 
it worked best with the brush to create the warming sensation . 
first ,  i did not buy this off amazon . 
this happened in less than a week after purchase . 
the others were so tinyl and cheaply made that they barely worked also . 
i doubt there s a better dvr on the market !  . 
hopefully you have a variable speed ,  hand power drill . 
thats still just fine with me i m still slightly interested . 
it s a product you either like or you don t . 
i ordered two different sizes to make sure one would fit perfectly . 
well ,  for me it s been a pretty lame product . 
it was just an egg with a plastic tag . 
i didn t feel like it consisted of a meal for a child . 
the plastic legs come with foam rings to keep the board from sliding . 
guess what ?  my cat has chronic uti with no known source . 
i am a long time user of henna products . 
however ,  they are absolutely huge on a women s face . 
comparing to starbucks peppermint mocha ,  this one tastes like mud . 
these are definitely the worst snack i have ever purchased in my life . 
they are  ,  however ,  the foulest smelling ones i have ever bought . 
wearability is none . i am sending it back to amazon . 
so i thought this would be somewhat of a substitute . 
i consider myself to be a tech and computer expert . 
i purchased this because i had high expectations from the kitchenaid brand name . 
i am appalled that amazon could sell such junk !  !  . 
this game was insanely hard i couldn t even beat the first level . 
they are very thin and the threads come out easily . 
at least i m not out a ton of $
if num_extend was too long for you ,  get breath of fire num_extend
it seems they tried to put graphics over gameplay for this game . 
this broke very fast and its not meant for people with big hands . 
but is handy to have when out on lake etc . 
one second costs you the match .  .  . the game is terrible . 
had a good taste going down but a nasty aftertaste . 
i got a sample of this for my husband . 
it will work just as well ,  if not better . 
but smelling a candle and eating a candle are two different things . 
walking an hour a day; now that made a real ,  noticeable difference . 
i ll continue using it to see if it lives up to expectation . 
i sent the vest back and got my money back . 
received coiled and secured with twist ties inside a sealed plastic bag . 
even with high quality clumping litter it did not work . 
lastly ,  the blade assembly snaps into the vacuum neck . 
this is not a fun game to play . 
when i first put them on they were fuzzy and warm and inviting . 
i followed the instructions on instillation and that should not happen . 
the only good thing about this game is the graphics . 
 can i have some more ?    certainly ,   said the ogre s wife . 
not sure why i believed all those raving reviews . 
it randomly spews pellets anywhere but at the target . 
the issue could be lack of enough molybdenum in the stainless steel . 
but i didn t like the taste of these . 
they give customers this link for $ off when you join . 
 straight out of the box with damage to paper num_extend
peachy keen also takes more than two coats . 
fortuanately it comes with a full num_num day money back guarnatee . 
squiggles suddenly started sounding like he is possessed . 
the real problems come in when you try and burn a dvd . 
my dog starved himself for days because he wouldn t touch this food . 
it is very liquid and not much scent . 
this game is still laggy even at low graphic levels . 
much better glass bottle options on amazon ,  especially the lixit . 
the second problem with it is the colors do not light up . 
the will disconnect with out line of site . 
heard something about a defective batch but did not try soldering this mic . 
neither ever went into a sink or dishwasher . 
also ,  the num_num has some serious focusing problems . 
bought battery in february and started to go bad in may . 
worth $ maybe if you have some use for the basket . 
i bought these because i needed larger socks than are loccaly available . 
i think i ended up purchasing this due to the wonderful color choices . 
its thin and the shoe itself has very little arch support . 
this is a very small usb charger for your car charger . 
i promptly returned ,  and did not seek a replacement . 
if you are night owl this is for you . 
the standard seeding kits available for $ are fine . 
the elastic just was not great at doing its job . 
not just the garlic ,  but also the rosemary . 
for a leapfrog product this is a huge disappointment . 
my dogs ,  beagle and catahoula leopard ,  neither reacted at all . 
if you want a lined bra then don t get this one . 
having a table nearby is key to grilling . 
once they get it ,  it could be a life long battle . 
you could hardly tell i had something done at all . 
these screen protectors were a waste of money . 
i m surprised how it got num_num stars by other reviewers . 
too small to fit a full size beagle during flight . 
well i bought these ,  ended up giving to my dogs . 
it s not what i remember powdered milk to be . 
when i order sandisk in the future ,  this is what i want . 
the entire picture turns solid white from glare . 
also was a bit on the bulky side . 
hopefully microsoft will fix this problem and i ll pull this negative review . 
i would have liked to play this game but it would not cooperate . 
this brand is chockful of artificial colors and junk . 
this is more of a toy than a good pickup . 
it worked fine at first but has since stopped working completely . 
what bacon  ?  very very mild bacon flavor . 
don t waste your money ,  especially if you have fine hair . 
plugged it into my botherboard and the computer wouldn t load . 
not to mention they cost % of the price of this entire radio . 
look elsewhere if that is the main selling point in your household . 
another serious drawback to the game is the camera . 
i don t think it has made it past one full day ever . 
i bought these thinking  what a nice color  . 
i was really disappointed after reading such great reviews about this product . 
my son loves cars and cars num_num and he enjoys reading this book . 
crap !  now i have an aqueon num_num gallon . 
i had the same experience as a previous reviewer . 
this product worked fairly well for about num_num to num_num weeks . 
the unit feels very flimsy and cheaply made . 
however ,  it made my dsl connection seem slower than num_extend
i loved dead or alive for the regular xbox . 
to protect the identity of her wrinkles ,  the friend shall remain nameless . 
i also lose certain custom key functions everytime i reboot . 
to be fair ,  i tried it for num_num days . 
the old saying  you get what u pay for  . 
i dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . 
there was the empty coffin with no fangs . 
the characters have personalities and the game actually gives you missions to accomplish . 
it did nothing to help clear my complexion of dark or pigmentation spots . 
there are no special effects and no movement by the monsters . 
i think maybe the design is not thought out well . 
the flavors tasted flat and left an aftertaste . 
i guess you get what you pay for rings true here . 
my son got this as a gift for his num_extend birthday . 
i had high hopes for havahart s critter ridder . 
he couldn t get it around his ankle without being painfully tight . 
its the exact same case that minisuit is selling . 
too much effort required to make these work and the instructions are poor . 
check it out ,  but at your own risk . 
i eat this oatmeal every day ,  plain ,  without flax . 
these were not my first pair of coquette s . 
i don t like ittoo brighttoo glitteryturns you of ,  . 
we tried them for over a week with no success . 
the leaking eventually got so bad that i threw this dispenser out . 
i ended up throwing the whole bottle of pills out . 
the straps fit nicely behind his ears and under his chin . 
i replaced the unit and had the same results . 
at least those you know how to cook with . bad experience . 
maybe it was the particular copy of the lens i got . 
before the data corrupted and i lost it all . 
it may be labeled a smartphone but there was nothing smart about it . 
$ for num_num num_extend batteries is very overpriced . 
thye do not hold up well to milk and go soggy very fast . 
i paid about num_num dollars for the trunki . 
you have to kind of force pump s head onto the valve . 
i ordered a men s num_extend and they fit more like a womens num_extend
i had my screen overnighted to me ,  and received it very promptly . 
i really wish i had just bought another pampered chef . 
i like the expandable band which this watch has . 
i like the idea ,  but the actual product wasn t very good . 
she wanted a little boom boom like daddy . 
i do like ginger bread ,  and ginger cookies . 
do yourself a favor and dont bother buying this game . 
the african shea oil was not what i expected . 
needless to say i am extremely disappointed in this game . 
would i recommend taking pictures through a tiffen uv filter ,  no way . 
the thing i was worried about was the fit . 
we watched as dungeons started stretching on endlessly at a snail s pace . 
i cannot really explain with words how worthless this product is . 
i found test drive to be a better implementation of the idea . 
this is the best chocolate  chips ,  cocoa  i have ever eaten . 
plus ,  the limited pages of paper won t last long . 
with the running stream ,  the loop was even more pronounced . 
mealy texture ,  waxy chocolate ,  unsatisfying and none too filling . 
i purchased these and they were a little too big . 
it is not bad at all ,  i quite like the scent . 
however ,  the one that remained unsprung was missing its bait . 
customer service is good but not all of their products are . 
we needed a reliable method for determining the internal temperature of grilled meat . 
most of the time i am cooking for num_num to num_num persons . 
i swear it comes with its own dust . 
i did as they said and sent them the pictures on sept num_extend
it arrived in a simple clear plastic bad with nothing else . 
at the end of that time ,  i saw no change whatsoever . 
it s just bitter ,  overly sweet ,  and has a nasty aftertaste . 
and the new child safety cap is bulkier as well . 
one scoop of this pwo contains num_extend of caffeine . 
trying to fit one of these to my ear is ridiculous . 
it is made for woman of size large . 
a person needs to be an electronics wizard to figure this thing out . 
the color and fabric was fine but the sizing was off . 
of course ,  amazon accepted return no questions asked . 
the hard part of the game is really the backtracking . 
then the outlet could be like a chimmy style opening . 
the first time ,  it was kind of creative and cute . 
i am returning this mixer after using it once . 
with orange colored dish soap it s a beautiful orange shade . 
i purchased several to give to my scouts as a fun survival tool . 
protect your wrists folks ,  those injuries tend to compound . 
this time ,  i tried it at the onset of the cold . 
only one side of the bandanna is printed . 
be aware that this looks much bigger than it is . 
i also have to take the phone out for charging . 
my kid gets so frustrated playing this game . 
the shadow of the stain did not come out . 
it is now happening in two spots on the zipper . 
we had rain today so i actually used it for the first time . 
my review title pretty much sums up how i felt about this shampoo . 
this foot shaver is the worst i have ever encountered in my life . 
i tried it on my laptop and it got stuck . 
they are cute but should be a freebie . 
the air pump adjustment did very little to make it more efficient . 
it took about a month to get this item . 
not a product i would buy ever again . 
you can look up the website of parry on google . 
bought two of these for my num_num grand cherokee limited . 
i have purchased over num_num stuffed animals in the last few years . 
the fabric is very cheap quality and seems like it would easily tear . 
the belly band part is huge  and it s a size small  . 
this seemed similar and like a safe bet . 
however ,  they definitely do ding my productivity . your milage may vary . 
it called a random number in new mexico . 
i prefer games with more interactive gameplay than cinematics . 
i ve had a couple of nomads and they ve all diedon me . 
i returned this bra because it was smaller than expected around the band . 
this canteen cup is certainly a super cheap knock off . 
common chlorocarbons include carbon tetrachloride ,  trichlorethelene and methylene chloride ,  all deadly . 
this product treats symptoms and is not a cure for anything it lists . 
maybe it s just me but ,  that s how i feel . 
but i really bought it for the sleep function . 
i am a systems analyst and pc troubleshooter by profession . 
plus the two ports don t both work all the time . 
should the supplier be ashamed of the product they put out ?  yes . 
apparently there are no high quality toasters made any more . 
just like clockwork ,  my second sharp num_extend has failed within five years . 
i may repurchase the wrinkle smoothing cream only to give it another chance . 
the perfect pushup num_extend are well built ,  stable and comfortable . 
the second charger also only lasted a week . 
i m sorry i wasted my money buying it . 
i paid way less than amazon shows it right now . 
for some odd reason i m not able to use my app store . 
it all makes me dubious about these miracle reviews . 
this is a waste of time ,  money and plastic . 
some of those foods cost over $ for a num_num lb bag . 
not really even worth a look ,  even for fans of weird games . 
not at all what i was looking for . 
the timing on this product was excellent for me . 
when i first saw these i wanted one . 
absolutely worthless for handwriting and almost impossible to use for drawing . 
and of course it would be impossible to draw . 
that s as much as the item itself costs !  no thanks . 
if you turn you head the audeo drops out . 
i ordered num_num cables and one was defective . 
the palm swells help it fit my big mitt better . 
i ll keep trying ,  but i assume it will be futile . 
these can be completely removed from the case . 
i received one that arrived broken ,  sent it back right away . 
now that it s back up ,  perhaps they fixed the problem . 
they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase . 
this is the only item i have had to return to date . 
the powder does not disperse evenly and your blow out is very chalky . 
i gave one to someone else to try and he hated it too . 
musicmatch is a horrible program . oh ,  one more thing . 
as a product it should get num_num stars . 
this shaver did not give a good ,  close shave . 
by far cod num_num is much more entertaining than halo num_extend
they are just too many to keep up with . 
i started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed . 
this writes like a bad pen that is running out of ink . 
i said oh god remove it immediately . but it is too late . 
it s imprecise because the dial is so poorly marked . 
fortunately  if you call it that  ,  it wasn t a critical part . 
i would like a refund or at the very least ,  a replacement . 
only num_num speaker works now ,  not good quality . 
it got num_num stars because it can actually capture . 
while the tire dressing is a fine product ,  this detail sponge sucks . 
i found this on two of the cloths . 
i love that it is paraben free but that s were it ends . 
it also states it cannot handle wheels larger than num_extend
then i notice the intermittent floppy disk access . 
this machine seemed to be handy because it had two applicances in one . 
the shape and rubbery ring on the base make it rock solid stable . 
it does absorb a little bit ,  but not much . 
but last year my garage went up in flames . 
wow ,  i have a logitech optical mouse and it works flawlessly . 
but more to the point ,  it s a matter of sanity . 
i would rate this a zero if i could . 
the real herbs extract is standardized to % vs % for swanson s . 
honestly ,  i think nowadays the only people who enjoy super mario bros . 
these were much less flavorful and much saltier than i remembered . 
these are comfortable but are a little small . 
native has a nice pair that i have purchased to replace these . 
you d think at least one cat would like them . 
i am num_num foot num_num inches and about num_num pounds . 
but finished the hotdog by itsself after trying half of this . 
the coffee taste like instant coffee which is stated on the product . 
the reservoir is so small it runs out in num_num num_extend
the colors aren t even close to what s pictured for sale . 
it worked after that ,  but i obviously don t trust it anymore . 
i tried the second one and had the exact same experience . 
i check the connections and they seem to be ok . 
if i continue with this hobby i will look for a cheaper alternative . 
but they are at least two sizes larger . 
num_extend static ,  or ,  num_extend pulsing static which makes listening pretty aggravating . 
this is the worst game we have ever purchased . 
this case looked great on the htc evo num_extend lte . 
it serves of no use for hair whatsoever in my opinion . 
as you cook beware of the odor which i can t describe . 
they have a num_num and num_num wan model  plus larger enterprise models  . 
i ended up sticking the end of the shawl to itself . 
i have to say that that i was not expecting much from this . 
i don t boom my music but i like it loud . 
after returning the amazonian clay ,  i decided to swing by macy s . 
i would not put anyone else s pet at risk . 
the little beads in it do dissolve as soon as you use it . 
i ll stick with the ravioli in the future . 
for dangerous toys ,  i also feel obliged to pass the warning . 
i was excited to get this but turned out to be a lemon . 
there s no button or lever to make it turn . 
i can t figure out a way to doctor it up . 
honestly i feel like i just tossed $ plus out the window . 
i bought this intending to plug it into my computer . 
it will only bring disappointment to your kids !  !  . 
i thought i would try this insect shield out instead . 
num_num battery s and a charger for about $
my num_num year old daughter was thrilled when she saw it . 
at this point ,  i am ready to be done with this company . 
also ,  if you tip it over to drain it ,  guess what . 
around month num_extend i started noticing a sharp decline in performance . 
my petmate bowl is now in the plastic recycling bin . 
at first i thought i used too much water . 
good thing i just bought a new knife set . 
with this phone email search on the server does not work . 
they are a bit tight in the toe and give poor support . 
i paid way too much for just num_num months of usage . 
what is worse is that it is very cheaply made and poorly designed . 
anyway ,  the pot does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
i m not sure if it s the caffeine or what . 
other protectors i could just wipe w a cloth or my shirt even . 
i put it away in my cupboard and forgot about it . 
i wanted to purchase what i saw as a picture . 
also ,  the openings for the ports are all wrong .

they will work for small calibers but they are really small . 
you are only supposed to go fingertip tight . 
i would go with warcraft num_num over this anyday . 
over the years i have used vaseline intensive care lotions with great results . 
also num_extend is exactly the same on psn as it was in anthology . 
my husband is a physican so i thought he would like this game . 
seller agreed to refund  cheaper than shipping a new one  . 
why do these game developers  especially ea  rush these titles out . 
i m bringing this camera back in exchange for a coolpix num_num tomorrow . 
they liked it more than i did ,  but no one raved . 
this is a big thumbs down for eagle vision . 
when you get to the  first date  missions you ll see . 
sega has decided to give up to the competition . 
both times ,  i needed to wash it out .

your aol dialup is usable but will prolly leave you frustrated . time . 
my yard is overrun with snails and slugs . 
all parts inside and out are very cheap . 
i also thought that the problems were only with palm products . 
in fact it was nearly impossible to calibrate it . 
this began to happen with the last two shipments i received . 
i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior . 
my dogs are rat terriers and this toy is smaller than their noses . 
not impressed at all and should have done way more research before buying . 
i thought i d save some money by buying these pads . 
on the first use ,  again ,  i noticed amazing results . 
still searching for something to replace the original num_extend
they were just looking ragged and i replaced them . 
the clear canisters lose vacuum ,  crack ,  are mostly not reliable . 
so disappointed that this is worthless after such a short period of time . 
but used it one day and it started coming apart . 
wow this stuff must be drying as all heck . 
you get what you pay for so i wasnt too upset . 
i ve had this product for a few years now . 
collect all num_num colors and win the game . 
it is very dark brown with a hint of red . 
this game might be good for children num_num years and older . 
all you can tell them to do is follow you . 
my son wanted the dolphin pillow pet for num_num months . 
all i can say is i wish i never switched . 
not too impressed ,  i actually bought them to cover my belly button . 
didn t help with extending my color at all . 
if it could do this every time ,  i would have loved it . 
also the character ai is the worst i ve seen since warcraft num_extend
i added this as a third waffle maker . 
i have very dry skin and this did absolutely nothing . 
wish i had ordered the midel gluten free ginger cookies instead . 
it s not a gummy type of soft cover . 
the voice acting sounds like they are reading from cue cards . 
left it in the freezer overnight and used it next day . 
spend a little more money for something else . 
both of them fit excellent and are wonderful shoes . 
i threatened with a letter and the bbb . 
i had high hopes for the flea trap . 
after all the great reviews ,  i couldn t wait . 
it lasted a couple months and the rubber edge tore off . 
make such a bad game i don t know . 
i didn t see where it did much good . 
nuts that are countersunk seem to stick up more than is desirable . 
i bought two different kind of cushioning inserts and nothing helped . 
the taste isn t horrible but it s nothing special at all . 
one end is malformed ,  but passes digital signals . 
i was very disappointed in this first aid kit . 
if you don t mind holding your head way back it works fine . 
their product is good but their quality over sight is abysmal . 
i purchased two of these via another source for my work . 
this fragrance was not pleasant to me at all . 
the toy is very hard plastic and easy to set off . 
this was one of the main reasons i purchased these speakers . 
this product does not give an accurate reading . 
i wish i had read the bad reviews before purchasing this . 
that was ok ,  since i was merely experimenting . 
i m very dissapointed that i wasted money on this . 
plan on using your warranty if any ,  if you go with this . 
i really wanted this to work for me . 
the first day i wore it ,  the sewing started falling apart . 
the plantronics voyager pro failed num_num year and num_num month later . 
my kids really liked these dolls and played with them alot . 
i wouldn t have given it to anyone as a gift . 
this lotion is very irritating to my skin . 
i tried it on once and was livid . 
they almost melt in your mouth which is kind of strange . 
i only bought another one because it was tearing where the velcro attaches . 
the acne that i have is like no other in my life . 
while ordering the high beams the configuration guide suggested these as low beam . 
hopefully ,  i have more luck with that knife . 
you have to get just the right angle . 
we were hoping he would grow into it . 
weeks later tried it again with same result . 
so i decided to try this ,  but my skin was very itchy . 
i guess it is only good for hand watering . 
i love all kinds of teas ,  i drink some every day . 
but this was the worst gf bread we have ever made . 
but batteries ?  maybe aa or aaa ,  but not digicam batteries . 
i strongly recommend looking at other options ,  and do carefully compare dimensions . 
it was a beautiful color ,  and looked beautiful on her . 
i am num_extend num_extend and the one size fit well . 
i m in my thirties so i know this crap is make believe . 
the result is a taste very much like a bottled italian dressing . 
kind of orange peel look and micro bubbles . 
we have a dog next door with awful owners . 
actually it did once ,  just for a second . 
i was constantly having to stick it back . 
i am num_extend num_num lbs and the extra small fit . 
this stuff burned like a son of a gun . 
send the rest of my stuff or refund my money . 
i will try less water and see if that helps . 
the product was adequately described and shipped on time . 
i don t have to give him beano anymore either . 
instead ,  you re mostly draging around in the mud . 
broke within minutes after my granson took it out of the container . 
i wish i applied my $  for both plus shipping and handling  elsewhere . 
further either there is extra material at the toe . 
for once just admit square made a bad game . 
both were never turned off and kept on during this period . 
her pedometer needed replacements and none of these batteries worked . 
within a month ,  the seams were splitting and it would deflate . 
i am returning and will find a larger size . 
they made the absolute best tshirts ,  sweatshirts ,  shorts ,  etc . 
they don t work at all and i see these in stores for $
there s no way i can get the cubes to communicate . 
mine is so i am now getting deer antlers and bones . 
i will try to return it ,  if i can . 
boy what a waste of time and money . 
this backup source charged my phone twice before dying after a complete charge . 
shipping would near double the price of this item . 
maybe it is almost that easy if you don t have wireless security . 
for me it is about the hellish nightmares . 
this is a update to my previous review . 
the pants fit reasonably well in regards to waist and length . 
upgrading to new firmware num_extend resolve the issue either . 
this is def not a great or a well made item . 
the size was num_num ww and it was like a medium . 
boring as hell ,  storyline is dumb and hard to follow . 
then there are the tasks of upgrading weapons and yourself . 
hench the name backstage assault for this wcw game . 
this product used to get soft with boiling water in about num_num seconds . 
of water indoors out of the wind . there are better fuel choices . 
i have relaxed shoulder length hair that gets tangles like crazy . 
when it drys you have crunchy hair that you can t comb through . 
the item that was shipped was a completely different item . 
this product has caused no end of problems . 
it was a wasted purchase !  i do not recommend it . 
i purchased this to install a scope on my mosin . 
i gave them to a friend and her cats did like them . 
it can be glitchy when it comes to fighting scorpion and shinnok . 
from there it would drop to % only num_extend away . 
i tried one and gave the rest away . 
i bought this after reading reviews ,  my num_num kids were never interested . 
don t fall for it ! it s not just my opinion . 
methyl bromide pesticide is banned in about num_num nations around the world . 
some of the game triggers are so random it s ridiculous . 
num_extend and on that note the game play is not very realistic . 
the scope i received had double cross hair lines in optics . 
what goes on skin is the same as being consumed through the skin . 
not at num_num times the cost of this lens . 
i bought these hats num_extend of them  for a party . 
that would really help me to avoid chinese made junk . 
thoughti would go up a size due to shrinkage and so forth . 
it looks good but runs very badly even with a num_extend card . 
i went through the standard troubleshooting checklist ,  i . e . 
this game seems like it s a bit of a marketing ploy . 
i do think though that horses would be okay with them . 
another short one was on the lip where you hold it when hot . 
now i can get my hair back to fluffy again . 
the slowdown in this game is unbearable and the camery will kill you . 
one of my dogs certainly like this little tab . 
yet the dvds read fine in other dvrs . 
i believe all those num_num star reviews are fake . 
my num_num cats didn t like the taste of the powder at all . 
if you use the older ,  lighter weebles ,  it will spin . 
 cut in half  is a previously inconceivable consequence of curling my lashes . 
i love ,  love peaches but fresh organic ones are hard to get . 
bought this headphones for two reasons :  the panasonic brand and the looks . 
would generate an error on pairing with the canon eos num_extend
i have two bags now going to waste . 
it leaves stuff littered all over your hard drive . 
however ,  the volume of all num_num models were in similar range . 
my next case was something i put more money into . 
i ll stick with fancee free because at least they fit right . 
 i have a stack of papers and back and forth documentation with them  . 
it literally seems to do nothing except slightly dampen my brows . 
was ok for the cost ,  but did not support well in cups . 
i checked to make sure there was a battery . 
stopped using it and after a couple days he was ok . 
i have no problems with the audio itself . 
this only kept getting tangled as i pulled it out . 
back in num_extend this was a good entry level phone . 
i really wanted to love this ! it does smell pretty good though . 
but then ,  what is the point of buying num_extend
i ll say it agian ,  the server software really stinks . 
the graphics are worse then the gamecube verison . 
its very bright ,  i will say that much . 
it s not worth taking chances just shooting at the range . 
this scale it not accurate ,  my scale reads num_extend low . 
the pci express is the only way to go . 
amazon has been awesome about replacing but this is unacceptable . 
i tried to thin it out with a little water on my fingers . 
this oil does not prevent or even help with stretch marks . 
that was my original rationalization for buying this product . 
it wouldnt charge unless i put it a certain way . 
anything with a squeaker is our dog s idea of a good time . 
make sure you want and need this before laying down your money . 
the title of the review is pretty much the sum of the parts . 
also going through doors can take forever while the otherside loads . 
the empire has absolutely zero ballz in this universe . 
as it is it s a second class player only . 
the pieces snapped together tightly ,  but never quite aligned quite right . 
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing . 
there was no jewelry cleaning liquid in the container . 
i had some scratches throughout the cultured marble counter top . 
this is some of the worst i have seen . 
i found it difficult to clip together even when looking in a mirror . 
when i received this i liked the size of the item . 
but the receiver didn t switch to the vcr input . 
so much for thinking this would help keep breakouts at bay . 
when i finally received them ,  the plastic package had yellowed . 
so num_num stars to amazon ,  num_num stars to the shipping . 
i had to banish them num_num peeing in the house . 
they worked ok before breaking ,  but didn t have much output . 
i purchased these for my husband to wear while working in the or . 
my cat jumped on the table and it didnt make a sound . 
not very happy with this case at all . 
the game doesn t portray the grittiness of the streets . 
num_extend sugar ,  num_extend carb and only num_extend protein . 
this will eliminate some programs when you follow microsoft s clean boot directions . 
these pants seem small and not true to size . 
the mount was too small for my ultrafire flashlight which is pretty small . 
there are better water bottles on the market . 
i found this game for cheap and it still wasn t worth it . 
i had the right size and had been very careful in the adjustments . 
another problem; the absence of a sense of speed . 
they have less than num_num years of mfr s . 
i have used md forte for years and also use vivete . 
my girlfriend can t stomach the taste ,  but i really enjoy it . 
i am undecided on if i should buy the same brand . 
not enough midrange ,  tinny trebles and severely boosted ,  boomy bass . 
each  puzzle  is a piece of wood with fully colored shapes on it . 
the belkin had a smooth white power cord . 
crisp ,  clear ,  sparkling highs ,  clear ,  tight ,  unmuddied bass . 
purchased another one to only have a problem with that one too . 
this would be a bunch better if it snapped on the bowl . 
a little after that ,  i started to get memory card error problems . 
once this liquid collects ,  it is very very difficult to remove . 
did not do what i it said it would nor as i expected . 
all the magic of the movie ?  ?  ?  how about almost none . 
i thought it would taste just like the bagged jerky but its not . 
the longest uptime i have ever seen was about num_num hours . 
disappointing because i wanted to give my  babies  something they would enjoy . 
i felt totally fatigued and had little energy . 
it s not very tight and it just kind of feels heavy . 
got this for my son to put his two rifles in . 
bought a bsa and have not had trouble . 
i changed the batteries and it remained the same . 
this makes focusing difficult if not impossible depending on the magnification . 
lastly my nail polish did not last good at all . 
but the best part of dawn of mana is its soundtrack . 
it s just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty . 
i bought this to replace my current phone because it was damaged . 
this product is a real fail for me . 
these were the best ,  though they don t fit properly . 
do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this product . 
what a waste ,  i m sending it back today . 
we bought these num_num months ago to use at a party as favors . 
water accumulates between the stainless steel exterior and the glass thermal bottle . 
this happened after replacing the battery approximately three times . 
good quality ,  but just doesn t have enough power . 
installing drm protection makes this game a rental ,  not a purchase . 
simply put ,  the food splatters upward toward the motor . 
i mean ,  it sucks !  you get what you pay . 
i ve purchased this product before from my local grocery store . 
i purchased these as blue but they are black not blue . 
this really falls so short of what theywant you to think . 
additionally ,  i was looking for an environmentally friendly ,  chemical free litter . 
i have tried about a dozen different insoles over the years . 
great idea but not recomended for small animals . 
they need to include a file with the piece of junk . 
after all of this ,  i was disappointed in the results . 
they sound hollow and get distorted when turned up loud . 
i would have preferred just purchasing a kitchenaid to start with . 
even on xp ,  it is a rough ride . 
purchased two switches ,  the first in july num_extend the second in september num_extend
my son had it for one day and it snapped and broke . 
they are very fragile and easy to disconnect . 
the key is to get the job done but do no harm . 
so it may not be any better for women . 
the media separator has cheap plastic mounts for the actual spinning seperator . 
it s also a little too rough for me . 
there has to be a better unit out there . 
the oils clog up the burrs so it makes sense . 
the conditioner does nothing to help with the dryness . 
why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me . 
they did thicken my outer lashes a little bit though . 
this was a big let down for me . 
you pretty much get what you pay for with this . 
the transformation is great to look at too . 
this product goes on soft and feels moisturized . 
there are a lot of plastic bristles in this brush . 
but so what ?  it s supposed to do that . 
please ,  before you buy it ,  read the labels and the warnings . 
i thought the coating was some kind of enamel; no such luck . 
i don t take anything at all now other than vitamins . 
it is fun and can last a few weeks of fun . 
i think i just got a bad one . 
this may be the down fall for this coffee maker . 
i looked at what he had in his hands and agreed . 
the hoops are about dime sized ,  so they are small . 
so i purchased some more gold toe to replace them . 
the bowl size is much smaller than the dimensions given . 
this shampoo is totally drying and not moisturizing whatsoever . 
of course this is my fault for ordering . 
overall the design of this type of coffee grinder is not ideal . 
i proceed to fire off about a dozen rounds . 
and as knuckles sports almost useless punches ,  rouge has bombs . 
it does have a tendency to spurt liquid out when you plunge . 
didn t even bother to send them back ,  they were just wasted . 
realize that it is worth the $ for safety sake . 
this item here is a waster of money . 
not to worry ,  no one else does either . 
unfortunately i do not need the extra help in the oily skin department . 
that said ,  my cats did love the fountain when it was working . 
i was willing to order num_num additional replacements . 
i have been buying large tees all my life . 
it is good to see call of duty num_num returned to infinity ward . 
as of this morning ,  it just won t start at all . 
first of all ,  microsoft should fire whoever designed this thing . 
when i got it ,  it was way too long . 
it s always worked great on my medium texture ,  thick volume hair . 
black hawk makes some great tactical bags and gear . 
the doll i received looked very little like the online pic . 
i saw no positive affect from the usage of this product . 
then more cussin  and movies then back to the risk board . 
i was really excited to get this case . 
i couldn t be more disappointed with this phone . 
i have tried illy coffee in the past and really liked it . 
i don t know why i paid num_num dollars for that . 
it seems that cost went up but quality went down . 
and i tried different and clear channels too . 
i just threw in my junk drawer almost halfway full . 
iphone shut down after num_num minutes of being powered up . 
my puppy chewed this item to bits and pieces in no time . 
so .  .  .  . starch and corn  which is also a starch  . 
then we started having problems with it mysteriously freezing up . 
the structure is still intact but with no squeak . 
cleaning this part is also near impossible for the same reason . 
i bought this really hoping it would work ,  but it s horrible . 
bought this from my local lbs for a longer ride this weekend . 
you need adapters ,  maybe put smaller bikes upside down . 
all of a sudden i noticed oil coming out of the motor . 
was disappointing that the hand gun got num_num times the distance . 
this was a short game and not interesting . 
the very next puzzle had a similar problem . 
i do not give one stars very often at all . 
half of the shoe is missing in my opinion . 
you ll see the characters limping and do less damage when they attack . 
you love it if you plug it in and everything works fine . 
the dvd drive is just too picky here . 
on the hunt for a more reliable replacement !  . 
i purchased this bra based on all the positive reviews . 
here it is so to a much greater degree . 
i was unhappy but ignored it because it was a cosmetic problem . 
i tried contacting the webmaster ,  but that email bounced immediately . 
i wound up using this for an hp . 
it felt like i was crushing the nail instead of cutting it . 
forums on the web contain dozens of examples for this same problem . 
just way to much sugar and too little flavor for me . 
i bought this instead of the ipod because it was so much cheaper . 
you can t put people or your created wrestlers in num_extend
you can check reviews for canon ,  nikon ,  olympus ,  panasonic . 
i am just waiting for it to crap out again though . 
i love the keen bali and they are hard to find on sale . 
it was very easy to pair up with iphone num_extend and iphone num_extend
now ,  i will have to pay way more for le creuset . 
ubisoft laid an egg with this num_num port . 
now i have happily moved on to other products .  :   . 
i would be highly suspicious of any good reviews on this item . 
there is no fun factor really . cool old square characters . 
the graphics are not as good as they are in the advertising . 
a very nice looking and effective tool while they last . 
if you ve played num_extend guest ,  you ve played num_extend hour . 
i had bought a large in a charcoal grey which i liked . 
you cant return this crap and it smells like pure alcohol . 
it clearly does what it says it doesn t do which is disappointing . 
i m not even sure izing up will help much . 
have purchased my num_extend kershaw blur num_num months ago . 
i was so excited to finally get this game in the mail . 
just know it will not last you very long . 
as single coated filters go ,  i suppose this one is ok . 
i got this crate for my older german shepherd . 
the second thing i don t care for is using the num_extend controls . 
i tried this with both the strainer in place and removed . 
i know it s a classic ,  but it didn t impress me . 
it is very hard to chew and lacks the traditional licorice flavor . 
i wasted % and $ shipping for this junk . 
score one point per priestess each turn an usual conquering rules apply . 
like the others said ,  this product stings a lot . 
monsanto and all the other rotten companies can keep their horrible products . 
i was extremely disappointed in this microfiber hair towel . 
i loved smash brothers ,  so i was expecting similar polish . 
for the price it was incredibly cheap quality . 
i ll stick to my maybelline concealer for now . 
i figured it d go away by the morning . 
i ahve to go through these holster kits every three months . 
please see my email below which was sent to cable to go twice . 
so again i am forced to give an otherwise quality product one star . 
i was using corn litter and never had a whiff of a problem . 
at this time ,  they are both approximately the same price . 
many days i have to blot it off . 
this shocked me because my dogs have never turned down treats before . 
there is always a path for the steam to esscape . 
i ve never seen a usb product break off in a port . 
i mean if i had an extra hand ,  maybe it would work . 
we are still so mad that we haven t even played the game . 
these cookie cutters are a disappointment because they start rusting very easily . 
each step on and off shifted the dail off . 
very cheap cutting and shredding elements ,  shabbily made without any precision . 
the quality of the boards is questionable because it marks super easy . 
this stuff stinks horribly and leaves a terrible film on hair . 
it could have been much better i feel . 
we went through the process many times before calling it quits . 
while it is comfortable ,  there was no support at all . 
i would try it if i was you . 
my hair felt thoroughly detangled ,  almost as if i had a blowout . 
the touch screen is also used for a few other things . 
that s a big blister for an adult foot . 
it bricked right around the six month mark . 
when i went outside with the speaker reception was horrible . 
for one ,  all dialogue actions take place on the touch screen . 
but like i said ,  its not too much louder than the num_extend
i was disappointed for wasting my money on something this bad . 
junior high school kids could have easily come up with a better design . 
i will be returning it for something softer . 
not nearly as good as i had hoped for . 
get a wheel cutter and do it like the pros . 
it does get hot and the attachments aren t that great either . 
amazon as always took the pan back and refunded me accordingly . 
well , i was expecting a lot more from an extended battery . 
there is much better technology out there now . 
i expected a thick rich syrup with maple flavor . 
seems to help with some of the symptoms i had indicating estrogen dominance . 
if it is just as good ,  it should mention as much . 
for the price it works ok but do not expect greatness . 
save your money and look at whatever elseisitthere . 
didn t do well on face and colors were very dim . 
i prefer mann or mahle oil filters ,  both made in europe . 
i wish i had just saved all the games from my childhood . 
i have had every problem that the other reviewers are complaining about . 
you can t see enough of your face when you look into it . 
silicone is like old brick cell phones vs . 
even when fully filled with water the sides are wobbly and bend . 
i admit that i haven t gotten very far in this game . 
probably the only game i ve sold after i brought it . 
this is a rectangular pillow case with holes cut for neck and arms . 
now i know why it was so cheap . 
look for a bed with the pump built in . 
first off ,  the blade seems to have sagged with use . 
the kids loved it but it is no longer usable . 
it just comes down to the stats associated with each attribute . 
when this is empty i won t use it again . 
i ordered it for a fun photo shoot . 
i bought the num_extend console new about a year ago . 
the num_extend and iphone cameras are very similar . 
i returned it and bought a gunvault instead . 
i thought i found the perfect one !  just so disappointed !  . 
the whole blood thing people keep talking about just look like discolored walls . 
i purchased this from staples a few months back . 
i wish the ingredients would have been listed in the product description . 
i must say i am very disappointed in this game . 
the shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair . 
i use this product and it works ,  therefore two stars . 
probably helps some folks ,  but did not help me . 
now what do i do with the leftover num_num lbs . 
so one would have to assume you re eating gmo ingredients with these . 
 well ,  duh !   the girl cries out in response to something else . 
and sometimes if you add any salt it will not work . 
no ,  the warranty on batteries is only num_num days . 
need pitch black to be visible and its still hardly there . 
these are nothing like the benassi slides that nike had before . 
i pretty much feel like replacing this thing now . 
num_extend mos after purchasing ,  one of the belt loops came completely detached . 
these are just a few examples of the changes made . 
made the mistake of ignoring ratings that indicated premature malfunction . 
i did not like the material at all . 
i am used to the bitter taste of most energy drinks . 
it broke within about two weeks as well . 
maybe i should have gotten the one with sesame seeds at least . 
i lost interest after a half of days worth of game play . 
ok ,  so i read the other reviews before i bought this dress . 
i couldn t even drink half of it before dumping it out . 
it was in the shop for months waiting for a part from italy . 
this game crossed that line and deserves to be banned . 
will just give it to the school to use for thier smaller kids . 
maltitol and xylitol are alcohol sugars and can be undigestible in the body . 
this is a blatant case of false advertising . 
and then there s a guy in a cat mask . 
the buttons are all too close together and too similar . 
this is the num_extend sound spa i ve ordered from amazon . 
too bad it doesn t come with a rear bag . 
this is the part that is meant to hold back your shoulders . 
unless you use a large size cup ,  this will probably happen . 
i will not purchase this product again . what a waste of money . 
dont you be one to learn our lessons . 
i felt like i had been in pain . 
tried everything to make this little  gem  work . 
nintendo was trying to pull a fast one with this one . 
however ,  i wanted the shredder so i proceeded with assembly . 
this time the plot is pretty cut and dry . 
as a matter of fact is sounds like a sick car starter . 
the one that finally took my flakes away was salicylic acid . 
it lost all the motorization and sound functions within a couple of days . 
let food be your medicine ,  and medicine be your food . 
their excuse might be  well you only paid $
i don t think we ll bother with probiotics for him again . 
i m still on the quest to finding the perfect tomato soup . 
the unit normally has a green light and the light went out . 
i have to give them a little scrub before loading . 
i didn t have too much luck with this product . 
installations did not go as the instructions dictated . 
every time i play this game ,  it gives me a big headache . 
maybe they work better for large heads ,  i don t know . 
this toy was basically a huge waste of money . 
something about downloading certain kinds of files through it . 
thinking it was a mistake ,  i returned them and ordered num_num more . 
even defective spots are tiny ,  but they are so obvious . 
overall ,  this was not the quality i expect from birkenstock  or amazon  . 
might as well give warning to other people . 
maybe that s why i hate this game so much . 
dont waste your money or time on this item . 
i bought this camera just over a year ago for $
we re hoping an exchange will give us one that will work . 
my skin doesn t seem any different while using it . 
i could not recommend them at this time . 
thats how it looked . damn ,  i really wanted to keep it . 
well ,  yes ,  it looks good on display sitting on your shelf . 
my brother is num_num and i got this for him for his birthday . 
i will not be not be purchasing another cuisinart . 
search for them here on amazon ,  and read the reviews on those . 
there is nothing innovative in gameplay to set these games apart . 
so num_num brand new pots went to the trash . 
three months after buying it ,  the card is unusable . 
but i mean after a while it gets really boring . 
holster should do the job but just not for me . 
i am always looking for kitchen gadgets that will save food preparation time . 
i think it is not safe as this can be appealing to thieves . 
this was an early sign to let the screen protector go . 
i have to agree with what most of the others have said . 
remember to look for the stamped national stock number for genuine usgi gear . 
all of my burning software only recognize these discs as num_extend write . 
the first time i used it i mixed it with water . 
let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat . 
this is not the item described that i ordered . 
i will come back and update after i have them for a while . 
actually ,  we just adopted older cats that were already declawed . 
my isp is comcast and i live in ma . 
huge waste of plastic and our international shipping num_extend
i ordered three pairs of ugg s from amazon this winter . 
its very loose and it comes off your skin very easily . 
and it broke beyond repair in my pocket . 
since it doesn t output to fm ,  you cannot stream music . 
this was certainly not the case with us . 
i don t have a lot to say about this battery . 
i hope there is good product out there to replace it soon . 
needed a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk . 
red steel has sluggish controls when it comes to aiming . 
it practically choked him when i tried to walk him . 
you will be much happier with the product . 
i will never cheat ,  so that is that . 
the results were mixed . it just doesn t work all that well . 
you cannot adjust the speeds to help ingredients process more smoothly . 
i will try something else from a different brand . 
i paid way too much buying this from nordic ware directly . 
there is definetely better phones of about the same or better price . 
then windows stopped recognizing it except every once in a while . 
now i m having problems with ipod all together . 
i can t feel my string with it on . 
i recieved it today and its a darker red . 
this is a revision of a previously posted review . 
for whatever reason it was a complete waste of time and energy . 
i thought you could use these without cleats ,  but not really . 
i have never reacted this way to any other product before . 
they were softer ,  thinner and didn t have a pocket . 
it is hard to believe that it is not made of plastic . 
it s full of old games with very poor graphics and sound . 
gets pretty boring fast . this was a big stink bomb . 
just won t stay in for me and are very uncomfortable . 
again stripping me of any accomplishment i have from exploiting enemy weaknesses . 
this thing is ridiculously flimsy and it arrived with crimps and damaged rim . 
these were cheaply made and the weld point snapped after two uses . 
even then ,  the coffee was never really very hot . 
i bought these to pull pork after being smoked . 
make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably . 
as we all know ,  china currently has a pretty bad reputation for . 
they saved and pooled their money and installed it on the computer . 
now ,  for $ i get only num_num months . 
i previously owned the cable luber that only has num_num thumb screw . 
he has barely used them because they were so dysfunctional . 
i m returning them and looking for something that is effective . 
i purchased this dvd player in december num_extend it died by may num_extend
i bought this game because of the final fantasy i grew up with . 
i will not be purchasing more of these cords . 
the mascara would be great if it wasn t for the smell . 
always needed resetting even a few months ago ,  now just wont work . 
i love most kashi products ,  but this one fails imho . 
that being said ,  the difference in calories seems to be minimal . 
ignores the biggest reasons of why i play video games . 
the bars were received quickly but they were very hard . 
he loved all the other yeowww toys ,  but not this one . 
so i was a bit disappointed with the game . 
judging from these reviews ,  there are those people . 
and it s those cups where this really fails . 
the knives were expensive ,  but they were top quality . 
it might actually make it a little worse . 
it is a real pile of junk and a complete waste of money . 
i started using this unit and initially was happy with it . 
he talks a bit ,  but nothing that engages a toddler . 
i m really sorry that amazon requires at least one star . 
these have a sloppy feel unless i lace them tightly . 
remember aluminum plaque causes alzheimers in the brain . 
he has never been very interested in it at all . 
the rice cooker was on my doorstep two days after i ordered it . 
nice company ,  will answer your emails . this fish is ok . 
if you can try it for free ,  go for it . 
and it should look like the picture here on amazon . 
for one thing ,  the levels are all extremely short . 
luckily i was able to pry it open in about a minute . 
they look neat and flashy ,  but never seem dangerous . 
you want to get your team to say the word  like regular pictionary  . 
they don t taste nasty or anything just like sugar taffy . 
please don t get me wrong ,  i love the zagg products . 
i bought this and used it per instruction . 
it seemed very cheaply built and the straps were not comfortable . 
that in and of itself is a chore . 
i would not recommend this if you wanted a cute sparkle case . 
you must be physically fit to carry it upstairs . 
i always hated those because they were so cheap tasting . 
my dog had this toy completely gutted in under num_num minutes . 
we returned the game to amazon and they took it back thankfully . 
i don t know ,  maybe i used it wrong . 
first let me start with the single player . 
i purchased these for a healthy alternative for gums and mints . 
they are some of the best hair products i have ever used . 
if you wish to speed up your cycling process ,  skip the products . 
i found it close to impossible to complete missions . 
the fan spins all the time and it wastes battery power . 
the plug must be very firmly attached to the pitcher to function . 
didn t take long for my dog to chew through it . 
i can t believe they let it out like this . 
there are little black lint balls all over the house . 
this is not intuitive ,  but also not a huge num_extend
not sure how this got some many great ratings . 
has no battery life  also it has terrible eye relief  . 
the scenery and the towns are beautiful ,  well built and perfect . 
they do feel fine once you re in the water . 
you would think this product would last more than num_num years num_num months . 
i started giving her a tablet as directed . 
not sure why but i suspect the length was the problem . 
one says  ultra potency  the other says  max potency  . 
the second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure . 
it s best used as a dip or similar . 
i have had a pair of these gloves for years . 
however out of a rating of num_num best to num_num worst . 
the lid was intact when i removed it from the packaging . 
it is similar in consistency to wet warming . 
this is not ,  by any stretch ,  the same product . 
warning !  !  you might get a penguin with a scarf !  !  . 
i was really looking forward to using it . 
i would have done better filling up at the station at this price . 
and right into my brother s car  sorry chris !   . 
but after a couple of days the frother fell apart . 
this broke within a couple weeks of getting it . 
decided to go for a different device instead of another fascinate . 
this is one of the cheapest bicycle locks on the market . 
maybe because one month is just not enough for any results . 
smells worse than the ferrous sulfate i get from cvs . 
it is not worth cutting corners when you are handling a hot lid . 
i give it num_num stars for it being reduced calorie . 
people complained that they could not hear me ,  that i sounded tinny . 
secondly ,  the paint is very hard to push . 
while some wreslters look very much like their counterparts ,  many don t . 
what i received was a generic white box . 
video of recordings looks like you arewatching a num_num tv . 
impressively ,  it doubled the amount of time it takes her to eat . 
buy a different one for a little more money . 
and i don t like their stupid british accents ,  either . 
i also wasn t dedicated in my effort to quit either . 
the spark works ok ,  but the bar is not magnesium . 
you just can t get all the cutouts to center together . 
jacks for auxiliary audio ,  external power supply and antenna come handy . 
it is so tiny ,  that you cant even see anything barely . 
it does taste vaguely cheesy but not like mac and cheese . 
do yourself a favor and buy a name brand curious geroge . 
i was torn between this or the plantronics num_extend
what a waste !  the screen is very poor quality . 
the real deal is the separator .  .  .  . it is junk . 
it wouldn t fit me  a num_num yr old  . 
basically ,  this thing has a really weak transmitter . 
the snowmobiles sound like garbage ,  the graphics are polygons . 
the socks are cute and comfy but shed . 
my friend swore this would replace my allergy pill . 
they are scraping against the barrel and leaving aluminum shavings behind . 
the price of the product would be decent if everything worked properly . 
realism is something that was completely ignored in this game . 
zukes will never be welcome into my house again . 
i cannot recommend this product and emphatically say do not buy it . 
i just got these this week and i love them . 
i would return this if i hadn t thrown away the packaging . 
healing items are scarce ,  so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically . 
you re paying $ a pound for flavored sugar and trace vitamins . 
i purchased his usual size ,  but they were much too big . 
i purchased the num_extend unit because it was on sale . 
nothing about proper mixes to meet advertised uses . 
once you start washing it though ,  expect trouble . 
pay a little more and get something you will enjoy . 
it wouldn t even charge after hours of being plugged in . 
the new one was not really working right . 
i ordered these based on the excellent reviews and cheap price . 
i immediately cut them loose and pulled the strings out of each animal . 
it was so light and i use it for stamping on my nails . 
it was dirty and had scratches all over !  don t buy !  . 
for $ bucks i guess it serves its purpose . 
i await the release of this title every year . 
the burn is bad and was not worth going thru for no results . 
and this is after flashing the unit with the latest firmware . 
but now the game doesn t work at all . 
i am just another sufferer of the panasonic num_extend error . 
they had to have tested this on a chihuahua and nothing bigger . 
then i went and tried no security and it worked . 
so the first bread i tried was a num_extend one . 
but the first piece is for the  screw  . 
i hear it works .  mine will be here monday  . 
this oregano had no taste and reminded me of shredded paper . 
some people may have received a better copy . 
forget sunlight ,  this thing kaputs even in decent indoor lighting . 
not one was interested in playing with this toy . 
i purchased this product for crows feet around my eyes . 
i ve had this printer for about num_num years . 
however ,  right away ,  i noticed something was not right . 
lastly ,  there was zero contact info for the supplier . 
great if you like fluorescent red meat you can see in the dark . 
i know a crappy chinese gizmo when i see one . 
i m not pleased with this purchase at all !  . 
it did a turkey and several chickens nicely . 
but the dough is just not fun at all . 
just stick with a ds or an gbasp system to play gba games . 
it would not network lan or send internet . 
i ordered the cet chews to keep her teeth clean . 
the game isnt worth the buy nor the rent . 
look for at least one of them on ebay soon . 
none of my num_num dogs will use this . 
brush is not usefull as it is not soft . 
first of all ,  the directions for preparation use way too much liquid . 
only glad this was cheap as its heading for trash !  . 
this is my first top coat i ve tried . 
they include a first aid handbook as a piece . 
i ordered these slippers for my husband as a birthday gift . 
or do they ?  the new pro version uses a file called num_extend
saw these advertised ,  they looked great so i ordered them . 
this is one of the worse squeegees ever . 
if the zit has a whitehead ?  you can t use it . 
it s not powerful enough to do anything on carpet . 
and so you finally know what you want to be . 
rushhour is crucial to the satisfactory play of simcity num_extend
i cannot stand the long crotches and huge amounts of fabric . 
whisper ?  whisper ?  more like the roar of a mack truck . 
either that or i got a defective one . 
sad ,  cuz you can get a nice one for not much more $
it certainly makes me rethink buying my other vitamins from this company . 
the socks was very thin with no cushion or toe support . 
i found it no different than if i enlarge my photos with software . 
this rifle was a lesson in frustration for me . 
as far as pro wrestling goes this is not it at all . 
have never had this happen with any other holster . 
clumps of urine were still in the box . 
it also had an odd aftertaste . i would not purchase this product . 
i did the same testing as before :  pidgin ,  putty ,  firefox . 
the price is not bad if you try it and like it . 
used a different recipe from the american test kitchen s cookbook . 
i picked this up because my kids love bubbles . 
i do not recommend this case to anyone . 
now these oakleys are cheaply made yet the price has not gone down . 
oh well ,  you can t win them all !  happy food shopping . 
when i woke up ,  i returned it num_extend
i shoud have paid more money the first time . 
so no more of these shades for me !  . 
wyverns have had their name changed to wind riders for some odd reason . 
it also seems to have many components of cheap plastic . 
also ,  the banana flavor overpowers all the other ingredients . 
you may not get clear sound even num_num meter from a base . 
people with small head may not like this . 
when i got it back there were pieces missing . 
but this product is a major disappointment to me . 
it felt num_num sizes too small in band and cup size . 
ok ,  i have had many nose trimmers in the past . 
it is terrible compared to the olympus i bought from amazon . 
these earrings didn t have the definition that the pic looks like . 
bought a num_num pack and threw the other num_num out . 
i also noted your all too equally balanced pie charts and my questions num_extend
my advice is to go there and avoid this trash . 
they may be good for some dogs ,  but mine had zero results . 
num_num scoops of this brand makes it thick but not creamy . 
i wore them for the first time last night . 
i ordered two of them and neither one had a lock . 
grind some more on the same mobs to get rare drops . 
want to turn off shadows  notorious frame rate killers  ,  not possible . 
i made calamari rings and at first it seemed to be fine . 
but finally it became clear to me the fm transmitter was just broken . 
hope you get better and eventually don t even need these . 
i had a bad feeling when this unit arrived . 
before you purchase you need to know this is % fake . 
do you notice how overpriced this stuff is ?  it s corn !  . 
it s really awkward looking ,  sort of off balance . 
he does eat other dry dog food and other treats . 
we love it because it keesp the doll in perfect like new num_extend
i purchased this for my num_num year old daughter over a year ago . 
i ve been eating gf for over num_num yrs now . 
there was no reason why it should have happened . 
maybe it would work better as a coaster for drinks or something !  . 
i figured i would just play the single player mode in the game . 
wore his teeth out in a few weeks . 
i bought this product after reading a;ll the great reviews on amazon . 
few days later i used the compressor to pump up my bike . 
i wet the pad to activate the cleanser . 
don t even think about using it for games like marvel vs . 
this product tasted like it was masked with lots of pepper . 
then i noticed a noise coming from the stand . 
i bought these shoes because of the good reviews . 
i will not be buying this again ,  ever . 
even if it did blend ,  it would not disguise the horrible taste . 
this was a waste of money for me . 
they sent a country meal variety pack and not a gourmet variety pack . 
the animals are adorable and are very well made . 
the handle does not look or feel like the normal oxo . 
that adds about num_num minutes per week to your routine . 
installing this scope mount is a one shot deal . 
when you read the description it says that you get num_extend
they shouldn t advertise it for a service that is no longer provided . 
my fault ,  not the product s ,  yada ,  yada ,  yada . 
overall ,  summoner is a potentially good game gone horribly bad . 
it was one of my dad s and my favorite flavors . 
one was a professor at a dental college . 
however ,  my unit quit working in num_num months . 
i emailed them and am still waiting for an answer . 
initially i was very impressed with the watch . 
on all num_num poles i had extreme difficulty . 
we ll use them on his paws only until the box is empty . 
i m going to stick with buying my coffee at the grocery store . 
this is supposed to work in the washing machine or the dishwasher . 
might be ok for a sleep bra for the above . 
tried these out on num_num different days ,  num_num cloudy and num_num sunny . 
the dogs like the food but the cans were horribly dented and leaking . 
for the past two months its been great . 
everywhere the kids were ,  she d follow and urinate . 
i specifically looked for one that held a checkbook . 
i use it sideways so i can plop and encourage curl formation . 
as am i because i have to spend time building it up again . 
i called and they promptly sent me the bolt for a full stock . 
however ,  i d like to start on the positives . 
it turns out there was a blown part in the motor . 
i don t know what all the fuss is about for this product . 
these are not the socks they used to be . 
oh what a difference between toasty feet and frozen ones . 
so i just stopped using it until i was clear . 
good company ,  but product was a disaster for me . 
actually ,  no ,  it ends up smelling like that but enhanced . 
my son was very disappointed in this set as was i . 
there are all new guns ,  and worst of all . 
this product sounded as if it would be tasty . 
i want a refund on this  ,  what a waste of money . 
i was expecting more involvement from the creatures in the world around you . 
i was hoping for something with less of a strong ranch flavor . 
i say save your money and buy something that will acutally toast !  . 
not sure whether he s not used to this new treat . 
it did work well when it did work though . 
i definitely was not taken back to my favorite european cafe . 
i have read reviews from others saying this thing works . 
plus you have to look like a burn victim while applying the mask . 
great design which is wireless and has excellent audio quality . 
i finally had to drag out the combat gel . 
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived . 
it wiggled in place but did not scoot anywhere . 
the problem with this mask is the material . 
i do not recommend this product for people with thick hair . 
pace is one of the worst salsa s i ve ever tasted . 
it doesn t affect the way it works ,  which is well . 
i sent this crate back because it was not sturdy . 
how embarassing !  i sincerely do not recommend this product !  . 
the headsets work well for a short time . 
this food is junk and i threw it out . 
this of course made for even more lather than it inherantly provided . 
i figured by now ,  improvements would have been made that fixed that . 
it sometimes cuts off when moving large amounts of it . 
i ended up unable to use it after num_num days . 
i think this is a little pricey for boxer briefs . 
i bought this over a year ago for my toddler . 
this product lasted about num_num minutes with my african grey parrot . 
i am not buying sony anymore . there name is loosing its rep . 
when i received this it was broken in very small pieces . 
i bought this led pack specifically because of the agt brand . 
i was disappointed in how cheap this product is . 
a total waste of resources and energy  and your money really  . 
it embarasses a truly innovative line of healthier products . 
it reminded me of rancid tomato sauce from a can . 
as is ,  imo ,  it should be in $ range . 
with this kind of game it pretty much requires you to group . 
the koss are also a tad too tight . 
it costs a bit more but is better for them . 
so i decided to buy this and use it for both cats . 
num_extend now discontinued ,  are notorious for a high failure rate . 
i went away after i left it open for a few hours . 
there is no romance ,  no dating ,  no nothing . 
you only get the teeny tiny cookie sheet and one cookie mix . 
if it worked ,  maybe it wouldn t be so bad . 
beware of buying unless you know what they look like in person . 
item is to heavy ,  not ergonamically for hands . 
you see ,  the average gamer is not extremely particular . 
best commercial anti parasite meds are nitazoxanide and ivermectin . 
the first time i turned it on ,  the power switch broke . 
i had read somewhere that foil shavers irritate some people . 
i was expecting something with an organization structure . 
at least they were easy to work with . 
they run very small . they are also very hot on the feet . 
sadly ,  it was a bit of a disappointment . 
the one i have on looks like the screen is dirty . 
it dies at the same time the iphone does . 
the graphics are really bad too without any kind of inovation . 
did what it was supposed to ,  but stopped working after num_num months . 
i wasted num_num already in my initial application . 
all num_num of these chargers broke in a month . 
for anything else ,  we find a better cocoa !  . 
i have purchased different brands and sizes of knee highs . 
i think it s flat in more ways than one . 
i mean a direct usb connection is all i ask for . 
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools . 
no liquor that i could taste like ashton burg . 
unfortunately ,  i won t even attempt to purchase this online again . 
holds galaxy num_extend att version secure ,  no wobbles . 
i just don t see any reason to use this . 
i have very oily skin and it does nothing to control that . 
i did not snack well on this product !  . 
someone in my family has worn these every day for years . 
tried to use it to film my youtube videos but it was horrible . 
its exactly like it is on the pic . 
everything smeared and i had no choice but to throw it out . 
i bought these crackers and i did not find anything  natural  about them . 
they are very short in stark contrast to their description . 
my dermatologist recommends using vaseline around the eyes . 
instructions for installing this card were a nightmare to follow . 
providing these things for the people will cost money . 
i would not want to live an active child with this thing alone . 
you can t let the slime touch clothing ,  furniture ,  rugs etc . 
yes ,  the first ingredient is meat ,  but do not be fooled . 
many people had told me how wonderful this game was . 
my dog much prefers the nylabone dinosaur shaped bones . 
you can t store it in the original box at num_extend
not sure what to make of this thing . 
the beads in the shampoo can actually stick up in your hair too . 
the bar is definitely blueberry flavor ,  but with a twist . 
sound is tinnyb  i use this while walking  not running ,  just walking  . 
it s dry and looks flaky on the skin . 
will use it in the office to hold the phone up during charging . 
they told me i was very muffled and couldn t understand me . 
it s difficult to live in a disposable world . 
i had always been interested in this particular model . 
im going to stick with the kids clothing stores for boxer briefs . 
the liquid dribbles down the side ,  even when you pour slowly . 
the gray it too light for my liking . 
for the first few days this product worked just great . 
he was devastated a month later when it stopped working . 
as others have said ,  the taste does not justify purchasing this product . 
it get blocked many times mostly when you are sweating profusely . 
product description says the device works with  tablet  . 
im just glad that it was so cheap . 
i placed this order more than num_num days ago . 
it s basically just a fabric bone that you soak in water . 
for num_num bucks you can have both it and a mirycle mirror . 
doing so from the web is also very fast . 
i mean it moisturizes okay ,  despite it s hideous scent . 
i took some benadryl and a chlor tab . 
then it was running on windowed mode only . 
if the photos are wrong ,  then post the correct one . 
even some of their cheaper appliances come with two year warranty . 
i would hate for this to happen to anyone else . 
tried multiple brands of dvd+rs and all had the same problem . 
initially this shirt was a good fit and pattern for a large tall . 
i won t try anymore pure protein shakes because of it . 
the amount you get is also quite little . 
you have to recenter it after multiple shots on clays . 
too tedious to work with the smaller one . 
i am sorry ,  i found the taste of these unpalatable . 
it doesn t do anything at all for me now . 
went to turn it out and it didn t work . 
once opened ,  our jerky treats are best within a num_num month period . 
the game is absolutely nothing like sims num_num for pc at all . 
it is not ,  but about num_num the times the physical size . 
a little chewy and tough even for licorice just turns you off . 
this is not something either my daughter nor myself enjoy . 
the description on amazon s page stated the tablets are num_extend
well maybe ,  but it hasn t made up it s mind yet . 
i wanted to switch to a case with a holster . 
this sort of stuff just shouldn t be present . 
i ordered this while deployed ,  tried to ship it to an apo . 
this threads into the lens with cheap plastic . 
i gave it two stars because the mounting actually worked . 
i opened up starting putting my cards etc in it . 
fabric is thin and not suitable for colder october nights . 
i used this for a few days in my difusser . 
but if it doesn t charge what good is that . 
like it wasn t hard enough to breathe already . 
and i was given a refund by october because this never arrived . 
we bought this as we needed more stoppers . 
if i add real frozen banana ,  the chemical taste still dominates . 
it s totally useless ,  and the electronic help file is totally useless . 
these abc batteries would not charge in my apc unit . 
so i don t recommend them for heavy aerobic classes . 
i ordered two colors ,  both came damaged in one form or another . 
cannot be returned because it s listed as a hazardous material . 
the next day ,  the dish was dry again . 
while finally getting the one side fixed ,  the other would come off . 
don t waste your time or money with this case . 
in the pictures on mophie s website ,  the lights are green . 
i washed my hands several times and the smell is still with me . 
usually ,  this happened before i could even pump num_num psi into it . 
i just hate that i wasted the milk . 
i really didn t notice any difference while using this product . 
the taste is so bad that daily use was not possible . 
oh yes there had been a mouse there . 
please see my review of the sofa cover . 
it was a huge mess and a lot of wasted product . 
i tried this product out and hated it . 
the jabra earpiece has better deep rich sound . 
and the penalties that are called are completely stupid . 
the graphics are pretty goood ,  but are num_extend graphics . 
when i zoomed closer to the num_extend vision became fuzzy . 
it s less expensive ,  tasty and arrives in good order . 
no pc where she is ,  so i tried to download as advertised . 
was way too large and didn t look right on either . 
i m generally a fan of optimum nutrition but not for this one . 
all i can say is that amazon customer service is awesome . 
does nothing to hydrate and felt it dried my skin . 
may be the manufacturer is not an iphone user . 
this ring ,  even in size num_extend is smaller than my wedding band . 
the older model was better  now at half the price  . 
this is a stupid ,  idiotic design shared by all honeywell coolmoisture products . 
as the old saying goes ,  you get what you pay for . 
this is one catit product i cannot recommend . 
hot beverages stayed piping hot for hours and hours . 
i did not use the ionizer ,  only the light source . 
there are many other problems related to this bug . 
too small and shiny and slippery for my growing golden retriever . 
i was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date . 
not ,  the barrel is loose in the receiver pos . 
this is my first pair or merrell and i am not overly impressed . 
plastic itself will eventually degrade ,  given enough time . 
it ended up evening out my hair color across the board . 
this is the second mask of this type that s done it . 
half spilling on the lawn ,  the rest on me . 
save your money and invest in another brand . 
i bought this for my granddaughter ,  who wants to be a vet . 
i was sorely disappointed in the cheap quality of this product . 
it makes my hair feel thicker and helps with the knots . 
i found it too difficult and therefore more frustrating than fun . 
seems to be more of a hassel than what it s worth . 
this review pretty much goes to all the games in this series num_extend
this is not the way to treat customers . 
helpful . i tried doing a factory reset ,  no change . 
just go to target s web site and purchase it for less than $
and my drain now runs quite a bit better . 
i m going to let this run a bit and see what happens . 
she smelled them ,  tried chewing them and then whined . 
i mean did someone fall asleep at the assembly line or something . 
everyone seems to rave about its sharpness and color quality . 
it made my breasts look somehow both flat and conical . 
but my advice is to pass on this strap and keep looking . 
and stoneware will also chip ,  and break if dropped ,  etc . 
i am displeased with the performance of this base coat . 
i bought one and eventually the primary mouse button no longer worked . 
i have been playing the sims ever since the num_extend sims game . 
the games look great but the gameplay suffers . 
this seems well made and it does the job . 
the rampdoesn t cause racing ,  too big and clunky . 
i guess if you can ,  buy your cds in person ?  . 
my problem was with the design and layout of the clock . 
those tv ears are not the best solution . 
it actually appears to make the pencil on the brow disipate . 
of the num_num left ,  only num_num made the grade above % acceptance . 
the fantastic foam ball medium ball is oddly more durable . 
about a year ago i bought a blue eye mask . 
a clearly designed website would be second best . 
num_num cases later and the internal spring  like a lawnmower pull cord  broke . 
the first thing she said was  these are stale ,  paul  . 
i m just writing in to say research before you buy . 
i have not found one that would work yet . 
giving up and going back to my bluetooth earpiece . 
it s the only one we ve ever found that fits well . 
when battling enemies you can lock on to them . 
not a good bra for a big bust !  !  !  . 
i have tried several times to put this thing together . 
you just watch it like a train wreck with your mouth wide open . 
my facial hair is thick ,  coarse man hair . 
the bluetooth headset itself is great and i use it everyday . 
a simple beeno pill is far more effective . 
i would definitely think twice about ordering electronic equipment from them again . 
the dark peacock was just a dark green . 
i use a flea comb and baths with flea soap . 
there is a reason the model looks like her breasts are smashed together . 
of coffee in num_num seconds instead the ideal num_num oz . 
but they ate it ,  and then the explosion came . 
wiggle the wire and the speaker s  might come back on . 
it has very low wireless range compared to similar products by linksys . 
the card slots in the wallet are too tight . 
see i m gonna be honest ,  the controls were not too bad . 
it is hard to keep paired with both phones . 
the screen sensitivity is just annoying at best because its constantly changing . 
and i believe the reason is who would want to . 
i ve had a lot of success with orly polishes . 
too thin material for this type of item . 
the blue and clear tubing are much better . 
this is another joke of a gaming system by sony . 
don t waste your time or money on this product . 
the neck is stiff enough to keep the light were you put it . 
nothing special to make up for the above num_extend
this case is cheap but it does not fit the iphone num_extend
i could ve achieved the same result with a sloppy bleach job . 
graphics are not the best for now but very good for num_extend
exp was not expired ,  but noodle was rancid . 
i bought this for my wife to use with her iphone num_extend
more significant is the large amount of blood this meter uses . 
as its price would suggest this is not worth while for anyone . 
he has very fine hair ,  so maybe that s why . 
it will not shoot a small steel ball over num_num feet . 
for cheap sunglasses ,  shop local and try them out . 
the image pictured did not match what was delivered . 
i actually saw a net loss in milk production . 
the bar was very oily and had a lack of taste . 
it also leaves a nasty bitter aftertaste in my mouth . 
my husband is an engineer and electrician and tried everything to fix . 
luckily ,  amazon makes it very easy to return items . 
but five months after buying this one ,  it simply quit working . 
it works well if you don t want to use the small cylinders . 
there are not a lot of colors that came with it . 
don t let monster mislead you that their cables produce more num_extend
this game stinks on all num_num systems num_extend if you count gba  . 
we were three to five pounds lighter on this than other scales . 
i didn t like the fact it has almost no bass . 
it has a basic spaghetti flavor and it cooks pretty quickly . 
we received this as a gift and really wanted it to work . 
it made no difference ,  the trackball did nothing . 
my wife was convinced the popper had been used . 
the control buttons on the right plug may have contributed to the problem . 
either way ,  my cats really didn t like this . 
simply a piece of junk that went to goodwill pretty quickly . 
this is a comparatively heavy tool to use . 
and will start testing one after another other vendors . 
this holster is not suited for the baby glocks . 
i jiggled the bin until food dropped into the chutes . 
do not buy this for an emergency backup like i did . 
it s pretty and looks nice ,  but started chipping very quickly . 
dumb . the transition between ground fighting and air combat was highly touted . 
case doesn t fit well and had tons of uncut places on it . 
however this recent battery doesn t last much longer than my old battery . 
no single tool manufacturer makes all the best tools . 
tried the case within a couple of hours the phone was getting hot . 
not satisfactory in anyway; not in performance ,  ergonomics ,  or service . 
well i ve seen better graphics ,  and new does not equal better . 
they always sell out at our local shopper s store though . 
gave it to a friend ,  maybe they can use it !  . 
when i activated it on sprint s network someone s name came up . 
this iron left my hair feeling dry and brittle . 
the color of the rubber side is black because the shoes are black . 
the single rocker switch is slick and intuitive . 
do not buy these please !  or anything with lamb in it . 
i can t eat this without getting the most horrible heartburn . 
i don t like the new product at all . 
i don t know why i have stayed with it this long . 
others it seems had the same blade problem . 
last time i checked ,  copper is not red . 
this new thinner style of conditioner seems terrible to me . 
i used it at first as a deep conditioner and was unimpressed . 
i had used this brand years ago and never had a problem . 
i choose my battery according to what my use will be . 
more like a toy or starter set for youngster . 
i have the targhee ii mid boot and it is great . 
this has to be the most difficult bird feeder to manage . 
i have trusted otterbox cases for years and i have relied on them . 
so not off to a good start already . 
the navigation and gameplay are smooth and easy . 
the case would not fit or stay together . 
i was told not to use this product by my medical doctor . 
we received this as a gift last year . 
it stopped working after two weeks ,  so now ,  it does nothing . 
i found these mats to be only somewhat useful at best . 
i experienced multiple side effects that lasted exactly num_num hours . 
ate it with food and almost immediately felt burning in my stomach . 
that s about all it has going for it . 
it is linksys ,  a well known brand . big mistake . 
but it pales in comparison to compressed air cans . 
greenish flare will be always on the pictures . 
num_num star for pure ridiculousness !  !  fix your dam bottle !  . 
i bought the product i expect it to work . 
i want to go lighter i think next time . 
i need a mount ,  so i tried everything . 
meet will get stuck into rough surface and bacteria will start growing there . 
my daughter received this gift when she was about num_extend
the stickers on his chest were peeling off on several of the toys . 
i bought this waffle maker a few years ago . 
graphics and gameplay are very disappointing for a num_extend game . 
very smooth texture with a little bit of granularity . 
i am returning this item to amazon and buying a normal submersible heater . 
for the $ i would recommend keep looking . 
the colors are nice ,  but they are very cheaply made . 
loved num_extend one of the greatest games ever . 
my feet literally turned red within a num_num minutes of putting these on . 
worked well enough until just recently ,  now i have the num_extend error . 
would not buy againand did not smell good . 
i almost always use them instead of matches . 
had that one for over a year ,  works great . 
first ,  it is shorter than it appears to be . 
these are not tunic length as they appear in the photo . 
has a nice feel with the soft sides . 
so my daughter does not want to use them . 
i will use it but im not happy with it or the seller . 
i tried it right away and ,  frankly ,  was not impressed . 
fortress is a poor attempt to modify the tetris formula . 
it didn t just come off; it broke off . 
after three months of use ,  the picture on mine is going out . 
it gets a one star for lack of proper sizing information . 
you don t need it in any of your products . 
they are incredibly thin so offer nothing for padding . 
in the right size it could have been a good purchase . 
the worst purchase i have ever made from amazon . 
however ,  i missed the personal touch of previous games . 
but do you want to spend that much money to find out ?  . 
plus ,  you re under attack constantly outside of cities . 
then ,  the inflammation in my joints and soft tissues . 
it goes on sooooo thin ,  it s basically not worth the trouble . 
i bought this based on reviews i read but was disappointed . 
neverwinter nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense . 
very strange indeed ,  i cant even keep them on my feet . 
this discs even have difficulty ejecting from the computer . 
not a flavor i could get used to . 
choppy terrible graphics ,  horrible sound ,  moves ,  and everything else . 
when i ordered this item the facts said the size was medium . 
i have only used three colognes my whole life . 
i am pretty sure it is the crappy agc circuit . 
i can buy it at the store for $ a box . 
radio has poor calibration of frequency poor sensitivity . 
i won t be buying this new nexxus humectress again . 
via the lush website ,  you can buy this item for halfthe price . 
my skin turned red and blotchy just minutes after using it . 
this game is the top selling xbox num_num launch title . 
looked almost good enough to be real but there were several giveaways . 
this thing is a great concept ,  but implemented very poorly . 
bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews . 
i really wanted this to work for me ,  but it doesn t . 
he wads them up in his little hands and takes them everywhere . 
however ,  once in a while they produce a dud . 
the mesh doorway was no match for her claws . 
this was cut small and the quality was less than i expected . 
my garmin fell off the bike twice using the bike mount . 
i had to apply several thin coats to build up the color . 
it gets old fast . the game physics are extremely chaotic . 
these batteries i bought for my sons phone and what a mistake . 
i don t really see the interest and neither did my children . 
my rabbit doesn t care at all for this thing . 
don t care for this style for my phone . 
i m still looking for socks that were as comfortable as they were . 
problem is there are not many real applications that it is useful for . 
hold in the reset button num_num seconds while plugged num_extend
whole fax seeds bound together into a crispy cracker . 
the contents of the  bagless  bag would literally blow back into the room . 
it may be good for you ,  but at a price . 
don t like the feel of them at all . 
don t waste your time or money with this one . 
they remind me of stormtroopers in black armour . 
it left me pining for something with more depth . 
amazon should stop selling this piece of junk . 
my dog had a skin reaction to this product . 
i went through many other lotions trying to get the breakouts under control . 
my boys love them !  they have cool light effects and shooting sounds . 
when talking to someone ,  they can barely hear me . 
they said zero stars should be an option . 
i thought its just needs some getting used to . 
not sure what all these other people felt that i m not feeling . 
i thought it was going to be a flexible fabric type product . 
also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . 
i wonder how people give it a good review . 
that allowed me to return it if i didn t like it . 
it doesn t set my dermablend foundation at all . 
disappointed ,  but i m sure amazon will take care of it . 
i ve been using blondish for about ten years . 
i tried multiple times ,  all with the same result . 
like another reviewer ,  one of the four stoppers was torn on top . 
when i got home i hated to say that i wasted that money . 
if you have rcbs dies your kinda stuck with this crappy kit . 
help desk is in india or some place like it . 
i can t figure out why she gets bored with it so easily . 
no frills here folks ,  you get what you pay for . 
these are nice for the price but not for me . 
i bought this for my daughter because she really wanted a princess tent . 
it is actually a little bigger  thicker  than i thought it would be . 
he started acting weird ,  not in a good way . 
this product was a real waste of money . 
i had to order another holster to replace this poc one . 
im really good with computers and this game just doesnt make sense . 
the only pro about this product is that it s cheap . 
in other games ,  there are epic dungeons or pvp . 
i don t need atomic precision in my readings . 
the num_extend shipment was tasteless and soupy as other reviewers mentioned . 
my skin is not sensitive by any means . 
it got so bad i thought something crawled under the house and died . 
we wouldn t have purchased this had we known . 
the headphones require you to tune to the base frequency . 
i tried calling evt only to find they have no phone number . 
i really don t believe that is water resistant like said . 
 okay ,  that happens .  second call to customer service was disconnected . 
it has taken a very long time to recover from the itching . 
people who like starbucks will not like this one bit . 
please be aware that each seller has a completely different product . 
even with supervision this didn t look like a goodidea . 
i connected another power supply and the router works again . 
if i do and have better results i ll correct this posting . 
ten bucks on steam and it s the hd version . 
the included adapters were about the only thing that was worth it . 
i used only about half of what i used on my first try . 
i was looking for a game that i can customize the car itself . 
in addition to being loud it is unbalanced . 
maybe you will have better luck than i did . 
these chews haven t really changed any of those behaviors . 
it even has cup holders at the top . 
it seems easier to use and of higher quality . 
warm body relaxes our blood vessels and we have healthy blood flow . 
the hard plastic will snap if you try to take the case off . 
way too expensive ,  bad qc ,  not the sharpest . 
they contain decent ingredients and most seem to really work well . 
i used it consistently for several weeks before giving up . 
this honey arrived barely wrapped in a plastic envelope . 
it s metal and came in a nice box . 
randy johnson s fastball has the same pop as tim wakefield s . 
the picture quality of this camera is awful . 
this product at amazon has the highest review . 
the ingredient were mostly natural too to produce the scent . 
i would have to advise to avoid this dryer like the plague . 
too bad i wasn t in the forty percentile . 
the blade is strong enough to handle that just fine . 
this really affected my reaction and taste to the coffee . 
i think they need to work on the formula . 
i kept fiddling with it ,  but nothing helped . 
you also need to complete the level  or scenario  within the time limit . 
you will enjoy that game much more than this one . 
i just think its not a good mascara and cheaply made . 
i ordered both the num_extend and the num_num plantronics . 
chop blade went dull in one cabling job . 
even campbell s has better chili in it s roadhouse style . 
who rarely uses phone due to her being older . 
the only remedy is to restart the game . 
was isappointed ,  it s a cute little bag . 
there was no tracking chart in it either . 
don t expect angry birds or other animated games to work well . 
it also works with the gunk left from braising in the enameled pan . 
the controls are ok ,  but the graphics are num_extend graphics . 
i purchased a separate brand usb cable and that works well . 
the capezio women s long sleeve leotard was not as expected . 
well ,  my daughter was happy with it for a few weeks . 
everything sticks and it is difficult to get clean . 
i hoped the hot water and steam would loosen the label . 
it fit him perfectly and was almost too small . 
it fit me ok ,  but it felt too constricting for my head . 
barley breaks the wind and on a cold day is pretty much useless . 
you can taste everything if your taste buds are working correctly . 
two in germany and one in a secret country . 
can be done but get ready for an excercise in frustation . 
i use aol cable with num_extend optimized se . 
the amount of num_extend produced is proportional to the bottle size . 
there is a big gap between the spout and the lid . 
in fact ,  only one of the two cars takes batteries . 
i could not trim the hair closely no matter what i did . 
we have gone through three of them and have moved on . 
so it does what it is suppose to . 
but buyer do have to watch out for the fitment . 
but it was too constricting ,  and i had to return it . 
but they throw in a bunch of b vitamins to get you going . 
bought this for my wife and the heading says it all . 
but if you think of them as a disposable item they are ok . 
i picked up a can of the sugar free rock star today . 
i have mini pudle ,  and large is to small . 
i was given this gun as a gift . 
this feeder is suitable for the black sunflower seeds we like to use . 
you have to actually call amazon to return and not worth the hassle . 
my dog sometimes rips them up and the mess they make is awful . 
coffee maker is more  user friendly  than the cuisinart . 
i could go on ,  but i ll stop here . 
i tried it for about num_extend weeks before i returned it to petco . 
i prefer to wear the phone in a horizontal rather than vertical position . 
the plastic is a bit flimsly ,  but has not broken so far . 
you can pick up objects and lug them at your enemies and whatnot . 
or prevent it from staying in the grabber . 
unacceptable ! i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
the rattle made this an instant favorite with the cats . 
it is not worth the fight to get him to eat them . 
it came with a whole lotta stains on it . 
there is a nice blend of little and big pieces of glitter . 
it has num_num calories with num_num carbs and num_num grams of fat . 
this may be easy to use but it is not easy to clean . 
coverage max and there are dry spots that it does not cover . 
now i hear gba sp is coming out and it has a light . 
i did chocolate and vanilla and they looked blue and green . 
that is because that methos introduces other problems . 
this combo of supplements is ideal and good for you . 
most people will be good with one scoop at num_extend of caffeine . 
this is not all it s cracked up to be . 
this works only for short ,  or short torso length people . 
my counter surfer grabbed the whole jar while i was at work . 
it looks different from the other seafood varieties and even smells different . 
i purchased this in january to use with my nikon num_extend
either way ,  its craftsmanship was below my expectations . 
i m not gonna rant and rave about it . 
i love both light and dark agave from madhava . 
i think it s the mica in it   mineral that makes the sparkle  . 
hi i just bought this product a few weeks ago off of amazon . 
when the probe was plugged in ,  it read  hi  and beeped continually . 
did not raise my low t level as advertised . 
alas ,  the little green plug is dead an in the garbage . 
compared to these ,  i was disappointed with konamix . 
i cannot believe how many people worship this . 
maybe if you love tomato taste ,  it would be better . 
not to mention the calories either ,  num_num bears is num_num calories . 
this shoes are too short and too narrow for my size num_extend feet . 
no stuffing i could just feel the squeaker . 
they are  working on new driver  but there s no schedule for release . 
think hogwarts without any of the charm or creativity . 
i guess that s a good indicator of how much i liked it . 
our new pit bull ,  adopted num_num days ago  est . 
this food does okay based on this one metric . 
my cat batted it a little but didn t care for it much . 
if this happens then you have no way to fight . 
i m not crazy enough to play this online num_extend
i m beginning to think i wasted my money on this . 
i bought this after a trip to india wore out my last one . 
sometimes you just have to get you hands dirty . 
putting it on my face made me nauseous . 
after reading the reviews i thought i would give them a try . 
instead of falling for scams like this gizmo ,  magnetic sharpeners and such . 
it heats very unevenly and is hard to clean . 
it was supposed to be hypoallergenic !  it is horrible . 
you can get a colon cleaning by going to walgreen or cvs . 
the foot file did not help with calluses or dry skin at all . 
the controller has force feedback while my num_extend has none . 
i think i ll stick with not mixing her food choices ,  however . 
the spout is very wide and water just bursts out of it . 
so i think that it some how toasted a perfectly working drive . 
my lab and golden destroyed this within the first day . 
i look so hot and strong that i almost can t believe it . 
shop for smaller sizes when ordering this type of item . 
i had such high hopes for this set . 
i didn t have this product ,  even for a week . 
the second time i used it ,  the bottom fell out . 
however ,  for some reason it made me more oily . 
that i give num_num stars too  if i could !   . 
i m sorry to report ,  but this is a horrible game . 
returned this cover and still searching for one that will work . 
it was very difficult to undo and fasten . 
card was upgraded after purchasei believe the minimum card req  . 
first ,  let me say i don t often write reviews for amazon . 
i love my uco candle lanterns so much that i own several . 
not natural taste like the other num_extend  tall can  . 
it has finger prints or water marks on the back of the case . 
part of the catch of these games is that you are nancy drew . 
it is the same label as sold elsewhere . 
the zipper is only on one side and doesn t come off . 
i did not use much of the product .

not worth the price .  .  . these bottles really are tiny . 
dropping $ on a game like this would be unfortunate . 
you can get this game used for $ or less . 
the mic then worked ,  but all the settings were greyed out . 
we could only fill water cups over the sink as a result .

its junk and is a pain to use . 
going back to old fashions press and twist thing from my grandmother . 
num_num stars less because of price ,  noodles ,  and size . 
when a friend urged me try this ,  i gave it a go . 
according to my personal experience ,  much of this product passes through undigested . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
uprights are always too loud and does not clean well . 
i think it s one of the biggest scams going . 
because the wand is short you can not whip the toy very far . 
most of the package is some kind of gravy .

call of duty num_num and num_num were amazing . 
this foundation brush is just not for me . 
i tried two different pair of the brown . 
very disappointed with mequiar which i thought was a good brand . 
the only reason i gave it a num_num star rating is for cuteness . 
don t plan on stacking more than two high at most . 
i sent this one back and bought another one at sam s .

if thats what you want ,  you may like this . 
the best thing about this game is the artwork and the quality .

this is one of the worst electrics i ve ever had . 
circular ,  film or digital versions ,  or quality vs .

first off ,  i couldn t get over the smell . 
if i let it  cool down  the issue would come back . 
i couldn t get it to stand up without falling over . 
after a few rude awakenings ,  this toy was removed from circulation . 
eventually i suspected it s the nia complex and discontinued it . 
it won t stay over your ears and keep you warm . 
npc s repeat the same lines over and over as well . 
i prefer mann or mahle oil filters ,  both made in europe . 
atleast you want to send you num_num to repair for extra $
i don t get upset like so many others . 
turning in either direction caused the helo to over state its movement . 
i ordered a spare gasket from another seller along with this cooker .

talk about cheaply made !  awful product worth about $
gameboy is just trying to make a quick buck . 
this is the worst baseball game i ever played . 
three hours later ,  no call back ,  so i tried again . 
the front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet . 
it s a little difficult to turn the top to the desired bin . 
not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry . 
unfortunately it does not even come close to peach tea . 
this is the worst eye liner i ve ever used ,  . 
the num_extend recording is unplayable on my car stereo num_extend out of num_extend
but my two stars are because of the ridiculous price increase . 
well i learned my lesson with rockstar and rented this one . 
i would really prefer a boom mic and a wind shield . 
honestly this isn t really much of an improvement . 
if you cut them in two the sharp edges scrape your throat . 
after num_num weeks of consistent use ,  i see no change . 
these are things my daughter knew by the age of num_extend
bought one of these for my partner last year . 
i just think it could have been better designed . 
that s good for little boys to see ,  too . 
not very handy when using in conjunction with a smoker . 
i can t recommend the cherry one at all . 
somebody sneezed over at ea and this is what came out . 
everything else is working and i do like the unit . 
this also means the microphone is opposite the home button . 
the color for strawberry milk shown here online is not accurate either . 
for example ,  i have used netgear for less $ but better reception .

i mean customer who ll buy it off me . 
it seems completely random whether channels come in or not . 
shipping was fast but the gun was junk . 
finally found a phone that i like and its fast . 
never will i succumb to blinded critics again . 
beware !  it is not safe for them to ingest this product . 
tacky ,  i was so full of disgust when i tried it myself . 
the controls are especially wack and will mess you up constantly . avoid . 
with each use ,  the noise is louder and so irritating . 
i couldn t even get the multiplayer to work . 
num_num minutes later now ,  and i still have motion sickness . 
it is far too loud for indoor use . 
why people treat their games like this ,  i don t know . 
i did not notice any difference at all after using this . 
as per instructions ,  i tried heating it longer . 
they had several good features as amply covered in other reviews . 
but one thing is fore sure ,  i won t be ordering again . 
i ordered the chocolate sauce to try it . 
the minimum in a saltwater aquarium is num_num times per hour . 
if you re nowhere near thin ,  you can forget it !  . 
on the surface this is a true pos . 
i am disappointed ,  since that is the reason i chose this design . 
just a leap of faith on my part . 
the shorts are really of poor quality and small . 
my little brother let me borrow his copy of the game . 
the bass is awful and sound quality is pretty poor . 
this is an ok radio except for the num_extend am reception needs improvement . 
i was surfing yesterday ,  using my pocket pc . 
i also noticed some breakage while using this product . 
i ordered the silver in addition and really couldn t tell a difference .

i have been wearing pocket squares for over num_num years . 
worked just past the num_num day return period then died . 
i is difficult to handle with my arthritic hands . 
it has a thin blade that wrapped around the point . 
but it does do what bill gates planned . 
i was so excited to give it to our num_num month old lhasa . 
real stuff also has higher vitamin and mineral content . 
it is physically impossible  i know ,  i tried it out  . 
what a dissapointment for me and a delight for my son . 
the oxy spot treatment maximum did a far better job for me . 
frankly i m jealous of those who can use this . 
it was the mohogany golden brown color ,  same brand though . 
and a strong dose tastes like cough syrup . 
i gave it one star in a relative sense . 
something was making it adhere to the cashews . 
we bought a pack num_extend counts  from walmart . 
the holes were just off and the silicone piece was too big . 
i ve been working to eliminate harsh chemicals from my skin care regime . 
this sock has % acrylic and the previous pairs had % coolmax . 
if it wasn t positioned correctly ,  you could only hear one speaker . 
still need to change after num_num hour ,  due to pain . 
it was a basic chocolate chip cookie dough recipe . 
total fail by melissa and doug and a total waste of my money . 
i just didn t like the pink on my phone . 
it s not even as good a value as the old num_extend
my eyes got red rimmed and started swelling up . 
as with other reviews its very loud with no volume . 
certanly i will not buy another belt from carhartt . 
i wish they d just go back to their old formula . 
they do like sliced and grilled fancy feast . 
this little dipper however is chock full of flaws . 
as is ,  it is a mixed bag ,  o . k . 
spend a bit more money and get something else . 
i honestly could not tell the difference while using the product . 
after several weeks ,  i saw virtually no results . 
they just vote for the reviews that support their own views . 
i literally could not get this on past my upper thighs . 
bought the router to ease life in  big brothering  our network . 
i am proficient in cooking for more than num_num years . 
don t waste your time or money on these . 
if you want something quick and cheap go with this . 
not ever have i had such an annoying problem with a wireless card . 
unless these things happen you cannot leave rivendel . 
barely had this a week and the glue is already failing miserably . 
all it really needs is to be priced a little more realistically . 
works good and the back cover fits pretty decent though not quite perfect . 
it did not work well for me and it is an expensive product . 
this costume looked really sexy and decent in the picture . 
i followed directions ,  but the stuff takes two weeks to dry . 
nice looking gooseneck ,  threads are clean ,  fits well . 
every sip was like taking a big mouthful of pool water . 
the wiz is the perfect alternative for this scenario . 
my child received magic fabric as a gift . 
the next came when i read the nutrition facts panel . 
then ,  it takes forever just to get into the game . 
the younger dog num_extend it all ,  though rather more slowly than usual . 
the little details bits can get chewed off the stegosaurus . 
i lost my adapter that came from walmart and was a generic brand . 
doesn t feel like plastic on the outside ,  feels rubberized . 
if you do it again ,  they will come out a different way . 
the packaging was ruined and there was a turquoise ink everywhere from it . 
its like a pair of teeny boy shorts . 
got num_num pairs defective from the actual manufacturer website . 
and health drops are very sparse and very weak . 
furthermore ,  the applicator for this product was on the poorer side . 
love the sensation of a closed masturbator device . 
maybe it s fine if you live in alaska . 
this is a good game ,  but not a great one . 
for those uses ,  this unit will work just fine . 
every time i hook up my usb hd ,  the whole computer crashes . 
it didn t smell funny or anything but they weren t interested . 
so i just use water in the serum . 
num_extend not even close to the best food on the market . 
lot s of static if you even nudge the transmitter . 
the quality of the pants was good however . 
i have never rated anything with num_num star in my life until now . 
i bought the honeywell num_num and after trying it sent it straight back . 
now the bad and there are more of these than the good . 
quite frankly i think that that section is a waste of time . 
i have large feet size num_num w  and these are uncomfortable . 
the parts do not stay on the  potato  very well . 
then ,  after about num_num minutes of watching ,  the picture froze . 
hard to believe they did this ,  but they did . 
the band is not made to be fitted to anyone smaller . 
i m not just talking about handhelds i m talking about all sytems . 
at this point ,  the amazon warranty was expired . 
they couldn t make it out of something less brittle ?  useless . 
it just will not take a good picture without a tripod . 
its hard to clean ,  and doesnot have any basic timer . 
i think the product description is incomplete and misleading . 
i bought this product from the manufacturers website . 
should have just gave them the money to play with . 
i turned it off and it would not turn back on . 
this is the cheapest stuff i ve tasted in a long time . 
one of my main objections is that it s just not that warm . 
if he doesn t touch the tracks at all ,  it works fine . 
friends and strangers alike say :  ooh how pretty . 
this item broke within a week of using it . 
piece of junk even though it cost almost nothing . 
thats what we want to spend our hard earned money on . 
it had seeped from the bottom of the kettle during the night . 
it s only fun if you play with a friend . 
i wouldn t recommend this based on what we experienced . 
i hoped my daughters would love this as much as i loved mine . 
i bought this in january and it worked well until september . 
they still referred me to plantronics . com after num_num prompts . 
unfortunately this happened num_num weeks after return window . 
my bread was falling apart when i attempted to pick it up . 
i purchased this a few months ago and i m now using it . 
overall i recommend renting first to see if you like it . 
it took a good week for my skin to return to normal . 
i was constantly readjusting and pulling it back up into place . 
i m glad amazon has such a simple return policy . 
even at $ it would be a total rip off for materials . 
all it needs is some type of grips on the bottom . 
it had only a minor taste difference when compared to regular unflavored cheerios . 
i bought this unit for cleaning my motorcycle . 
ended up selling this at a garage sale for $
also ,  it is not as finely ground as indian besan . 
it seamed a little too pixelated and dark . 
i had the impression flash cards lasted a long time . 
this is crapola ,  made in china and looks and feels like it . 
the bain de soleil mega tan had a very drying effect on skin . 
this is a ton of tea for what you pay for . 
to me this is unquestionably lazy game design . 
anything other than static lighting yields frame rates down around num_num fps . 
it really does react to your playing style . 
something like this product should not arrive like one of these did . 
newcomers in the diablo world will feel just dandy with this game . 
it was gross and i tossed it out . 
it does boost energy ,  performance and strength for workouts . 
the batteries were the ones advertised ,  just not inexpensive . 
the machine was stopped and the chunks of frozen bananna were added . 
it just sucks because their plus size bras are all discontinued . 
still have rats in the ceiling going back to poison i guess . 
my daughter tried these on and immediately hated them . 
they lasted three weeks before both boots tore across the top of foot . 
it s not to be confused with  monster cable  . 
vendor hasn t repliedto my email of three weeks ago . 
i will not replace this with a sony . 
had high hopes after reading some of the positive reviews here and elsewhere . 
but oh my gosh ,  stay away from this game . 
if i could ,  i would give this product zero stars . 
one half of one was kind of big for my num_num lb dog . 
even with iogear tech support it is useless . 
this lotion is creamy and is meant to be used sparingly . 
this charger is listed to work with the num_extend and num_extend
this game has no sense of linearity to it at all . 
pass on this ,  don t get suckered in by the low price . 
i feel like i threw money straight into the trash . 
one ear bus barely works and both sound  tinny  . 
i have to bang and smack it to start it up . 
not worth the effort to return it ,  bought another . 
it is the voice changer that i had trouble with . 
i bought the identical camo version from amazon for moving soldier gear around . 
i was looking at other types of covers for clothes . 
the sound quality of my music ,  though ,  was excellent . 
there are still great knifes out there just beware the sticker shock . 
i ve never experienced this problem with batteries before . 
if you are going to buy a sigma lens any sigma lens . 
i also like that the beeper will eventually stop on its own . 
i would have never bought this for her myself . 
that decision was made just under a year ago . 
also it was super cold so he could go outside . 
i dont really know ,  i lost track of what happened . 
you use to have quality i could trust . 
too bad i bought num_num bottles ,  glad i did not buy num_extend
looking at the ingredients list ,  it shouldn t surprise . 
i will give it num_num stars for this . 
on a positive note i will say it was easy to program . 
wont buy wont use ill most likely burn the one i have . 
luckily my other cat has always been just fine . 
i didn t want to purchase it because of the price . 
this is the major reason i am giving the bottoms three stars . 
it also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora . 
i don t like this game chiefly because the music sucks . 
this is likely why the storm sounded louder to me . 
needless to say i am not at my best this morning . 
a lot of my freinds have it and love it . 
filter packs have very little carbon in them . 
never before have i received compliments on a phone case . 
it is bs to take them for num_num months before you see results . 
the thickest bones it ran into would be in a pork chop . 
after only three weeks ,  this one started doing the exact same thing . 
size ,  material ,  and workmanship get a thumbs dowm . 
this timer is extremely small and light weight . 
one is that the velcro will not stay latched . 
i much prefer merrick bones and elk rack snacks to these . 
there are like num_num environments that are small ,  repetitive ,  and bland . 
i bought this a few years ago from amazon . 
the handles are small and very close to the griddle . 
which ought to tell you something . google this : blackhawk serpa issues . 
the square is num_num shapes which fit to be a square . 
when it arrived ,  i was a little disappointed . 
this case is better than having no case at all . 
the character models are bland and ,  the animation isn t even noteworthy . 
the object typically being to find and collect the super star . 
 the kong ball is great fyi  hope this helps  :   . 
it was cheap ,  but i wouldn t buy it again . 
i grabbed the phone and it came back . 
the worst part is the smell ,  which is very strong . 
in addition ,  it is light and easy to maneuver . 
i couldn t get it to work and never returned it  my bad  . 
they would leak within a minute of putting my head under water . 
there is a rubber gasket between the glass cover and the metal rim . 
my replay tv num_num died after num_num months . 
that were % better then these very thin gloves . 
never knew an unmanaged switch can malfunction unoperaterable . 
the star rating is no reflection on them whatsoever . 
its like they haven t changed this product since num_num or something . 
but my opinion of it hasn t changed at all . 
now ,  they are curious and stick around because of the scent . 
this is my first time buying this kind of product . 
however ,  mine was only good for num_num months . 
it is just too horrible of a taste to tolerate . 
basically ,  the actuall gameplay is at a num_num year old level . 
even with the bigger size ,  it looks like underwear . 
wish i could find someone that liked them so i could ditch them . 
not happy ,  the hair was the only thing that has any quality . 
i would buy a larger size next time . 
we rush him into the er and theirs reads num_num degrees . 
naturally it was out of warranty when that happened . 
i m disappointed because i really wanted to like this product . 
my daughter has no interest in this at all . 
she picked off pieces of the sticker cover almost immediately . 
i highly suggest staying away from this product . 
mostly the stitching quality on the shoe is really poor . 
it worked for a few months then failed . 
i would not recommend this to a friend . 
i definitely wouldn t recommend this to anyone who has acne . 
the motor gets stuck and it resets or stops entirely . 
it s kind of annoying ,  but not a deal breaker . 
not you typical run of the mill ginger cookie dipped in chocolate . 
if not ,  it can stay on the review page . 
however ,  i m lowering the score and adding new comments . 
this about my num_extend case i ve tried for my s iii . 
then a skating accident smashed my left patella to bits . 
in addition ,  there was a very strong and unpleasant aftertaste . 
the sizes for this product are not true . 
they were expensive and did not fit well . 
i just don t know what the ingredient s  is . 
this one comes from overseas and took num_num full weeks to arrive . 
the end is hard and there are little hard nubs . 
you can t make anything because it falls apart instantly . 
i purchased two and it came out to about $
if your nose is not % dry ,  this will slip out . 
then you try a photosmart num_num and it doesn t even register . 
the sights are a mix of good and bad . 
get rid of the high fructose and you might have a winner . 
this sugar is called turbinado sugar ,  but is misleading . 
these headphones were great when they cost around $
this lens eats light for breakfast ,  and little into lunch . 
basically ,  bring this person x number of y items . 
every turn involves the micromanagement of every possible aspect of running a society . 
oh ,  it also slides around the car while i m driving . 
the low is very low ,  and the high is very high . 
for whatever reason ,  i can t get use to this . 
cheaply made and not at all what i was looking for . 
i have bought other brands and loved them . 
if you have a small head ,  these will not work for you . 
feel it s only a matter of time before the motor burns out . 
but that is exactly why i like them . 
it still charges ,  but it slides out too easily . 
i suspect that these are either recycled or defective batteries . 
i bought two units one still works and one doesn t . 
i put a few of these down and the ants ignored it . 
we re the same people that bought into the amazon rating system . 
after using this product the blades were hot after two minutes . 
whatever the case may be ,  i won  bother with this brand again . 
started having bluescreens as soon as it was installed . 
i think one will find the alternatives far more appetizing and satisfying . 
be careful not to break your leg trying to kick it . 
i just really don t like how these fit or work . 
i purchased maybe ten of these over a year ago . 
i have used several plantronics ,  some i liked ,  some i loved . 
i bought these for my mom who likes sardines . 
no saying how old they are ,  but at least they work . 
first of all ,  it s extremely difficult and frustrating . 
i bought this product ,  but i never saw it in one piece . 
the guy who answered was very rude and impatient . 
i don t have sensitive skin per se ,  but this stuff stings . 
you ll notice every few seconds that cpu usage goes through the roof . 
i had the hardest time finding the right cable . 
it may just be my brand of phone ,  not sure . 
no sound comes out of the left side . 
tony hawk s pro skater num_num is harder than this trash . 
it tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy ,  like tooth breaking crunchy . 
these are as horrible as what comes bundled with most players . 
i got num_num of these bugs for my grandchildren for christmas . 
this only uses weight to keep the lid down . 
i m not sure i would purchase this again . 
the felt tip came off after num_num lenses cleaning . 
phone support tells me to upgrade the firmware to num_extend
as for performance ,  the play of this title is just plain . 
only this mouse gives problems and crashes setpoint . 
perhaps they d be better in soup ,  but probably not much better . 
and it does not keep other smells from creeping in . 
the packaging is so deceiving with a name like dr . 
if he forgets ,  it doesn t register the amount . 
so i am out more than $ and without socks . 
now nintendo is fading and the fad has sadly gone . 
will be requesting a replacement . update num_extend replacement came in . 
i will never buy another !  customer support was a joke . 
unless you re using this outdoors ,  the item stinks . 
i didn t believe it could be at first . 
was shooting aperture prefered with my focus point dedicated to the center point . 
loved it . less than num_num weeks later ,  it would not work . 
the also block out an unbelievable amount of noise . 
there are six buttons for children to press . 
it smells like what would be produced by boiling fish in whole milk . 
it fits like a sleep bra; no support . 
we had to use glue dots to place them . 
they went away in a few days ,  thankfully . 
if you like your drinks very sweet ,  you might enjoy gold kill . 
from the reviews i read i was expecting more . 
there is also no car damage making this game seem totally unrealistic . 
i have a small soft tub hot tub . 
i m sorry i spent the money on them . 
this is way too small to put in the ear . 
the translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading . 
very awkward ,  guess i ll use it when my others wear out . 
i sent mine back without even letting my num_num month old see it . 
the gamecube resetti was much more amusing and less severe . 
i used it up in less than a week . 
it s ok for table setting ,  but that s it . 
i used it for few months and i didn t see any difference . 
the peanut butter flavor is the best by far . 
i was reading on multiple site that this is a common occurance . 
glad i realized she chewed it before taking her out . 
it s like the most popular flavor on the market . 
the pink came out a horrible fright wig pinkish purple neon color . 
however ,  my dog does like the taste of it  at least initially  . 
light weight , compact and the price was right with free shipping . 
the product appears to be ok other than that . 
it simply  gave up the ghost  and was ready for the trash bin . 
i never wore them in snow or wet conditions . 
i believe the pro earpiece was flexed once too often inserting over ear . 
so effectively this case is useless to me . 
also made my stomach hurt like crazy while using it . 
too bad there is not a hiss detector in the fine tune circuitry . 
it might be a great product but not for sensitive skin . 
best i could do was shut down and start over . 
i saw this shirt and thought it looked gorgeous in the picture . 
i end up going back to digging out the hairs with tweezers . 
i left the base out because i need chopped walnuts in the morning . 
i have to constantly force my other computer to retrack the network . 
too bad it doesn t taste as good as it smells . 
as a bowling game toy it does not work very well . 
i see that they now have one with pomegranate and almond . 
to be honest ,  i have not finished the game . 
a num_extend pixel screen instead of zire s num_extend num_extend
it will not respond when moving it to the right . 
i wish i could return these  i bought a few flavors being dumb  . 
the only more unbalanced online shooter i have played in recent memory was . 
save your money and just use baby orgel . 
a month later that toys store burned down . 
tis is a tiny bottle that is overly expensive . 
i ve worn k swiss shoes for as long as i can remember . 
the circuit breaker tripped after a few months . 
it is probably great for people who do not take bp medication . 
the fifth time i used it is leaked . 
hopefully ,  the person who got it knew what they were doing . 
instead ,  the cloths had a thick tissue feel . 
i tried a different one with the same cord and bam it charged . 
my dog ripped them apart in just minutes . 
i used it for weeks and still nothing . 
i was not overfeeding either ,  before somebody chimes in . 
i also like that it only takes num_num minutes to process . 
as of friday morning ,  the player was totally dead . 
my num_num year old niece just received this for her birthday . 
works for about num_num minutes after power cycling . 
i was better off with a top sheet wrapped around the foot . 
it s way too heavy and the openings are just too big . 
i am seeing the same donuts etc from other food sets . 
i bought this product because it had pretty great reviews . 
this game however is a huge step back in both departments . 
i couldn t identify any oolong flavor at all . 
i have no idea what the problem is . 
i turned it off and left it alone for a few hours . 
you need almost a num_num inch thick pad . 
i used this for two weeks without using proxabrushes for my perio problems . 
love the battery but hate the cover would never buy again !  !  . 
you can t replay any of the missions without starting the entire game num_extend
this game has the potential to be great . 
the bots ,  the weapons ,  the levels ,  it was great . 
that happened well with in the first two months . 
i am a big fan of carbonated soft drinks and juice drinks . 
these these are small and hard as a rock . 
within three months ,  the front cover of this box broke . 
it s % playable and combat is an exact clone of the original . 
now looking for a replacement and it won t be this one . 
i found it in left for dead and left for dead num_extend
my tongue got whiter ,  my toes and hands began peeling . 
the detractions are everything that lights up is black . 
according to the bottle ,  it says to lather ,  rinse and repeat . 
you can waste your money if you want but read the real reviews . 
oxo usually makes fantastic kitchen utensils ,  but this is a bust . 
this will also be my last waring purchase ever . 
color is a orange red and fades every time it s washed . 
thought it was going to work but no ,  it hurt me instead . 
guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music !  . 
trees ,  beaches ,  water ,  tightropes ,  platforms ,  rinse and repeat . 
i guess these will be good if you have really skinny legs . 
i wanted to like this tea ,  but i just did not . 
this one is pretty much useless and no fun for my daughter . 
for my part i won t be ordering this again . 
so be sure of what you are ordering ,  unlike myself !  . 
i guess you get what you pay for here . 
i certainly won t buy it again once this can is gone . 
i realized i snore at night because of my cellphone . 
they are made of wood so are durable . 
unfortunately ,  this one was made in new jersey . 
didn t do anything to my stubborn plantar warts on the foot . 
it now rest at bottom of a box . 
and ,  i never could get it hooked up to the bike . 
then ,  when i read the packaging it said % natural flavoring  . 
those received appear to be made of high quality materials with stout connectors . 
i received one gigantic bowl which i immediately returned to amazon . 
i would love to see them do so . 
i tried all the different cords i had . 
the watch looks robust but is chunky and very heavy . 
the flavor is not so great ,  in my opinion . 
i just don t like the fact that the stimulation was so strong . 
spend the extra money and get a quality tool . 
as i said ,  watching the film is better . 
magazine filled in no time with every round . 
i used credit cards and everything and it was still a pain . 
item arrived with key pieces missing and very poor quality . 
no body could hear me or understand what i was saying . 
i just don t see what all the hype is about . 
i thought it was pretty drying and stripped my skin of oils . 
however ,  that is another product and another story . 
it had worked perfectly just a few hours before . 
pnats looked nice ,  but they did not fit properly in the back . 
as i applied it ,  it felt like a glue stick . 
running windows xp ,  i could not get the software to work properly . 
in conclusion ,  gameboy is not all it s cracked up to be . 
this memory card is a complete waste of your money . 
however ,  i have yet to find a way to make it work . 
the whole game just couldn t hold my interest . 
on my mossberg num_num you have to take this off to clean it . 
i do not recommend product as it does not provide adequate support . 
upper was fine ,  sole was fine and both had minimal wear . 
i was far from hitting pan so i m not sure what happened . 
to me ,  it sounds more like a recording level problem . 
no where in the instruction pamphlet did i see this mentioned . 
can t believe i paid so much for this . 
the only word appropriate for describing this product is gross . 
i think it actually enhances the smell of ammonia . 
it was basically like an immersion heater in a plastic kettle . 
this color looks absolutely nothing like the picture !  . 
back to norelco and everything is much better . 
there really isn t anything great about this game . 
seemed like too much trouble to ship back a num_num dollar item . 
need num_num feet ?  you d have to uniwind the whole thing . 
i didn t have the time to deal with that . 
i ended up washing it off and trying to give it away . 
after i acknowledge this ,  i just threw the remaining in the garbage . 
unfortunately ,  i can t remember where i purchased mine . 
i recently got a remington nose hair trimmer from amazon to replace this . 
he says it s cold by the time he gets to it . 
i noticed that others have had the same problem . 
clear ,  understandable and others could hear me clearly . 
it seems way outdated and not up to todays standards in any department . 
for design num_num stars ,  for the size and usability num_num stars . 
the first time was on the num_extend  out of num_extend cds . 
i have a gmc savana that requires two num_extend blades . 
it literally cycled on and off all night while charging . 
worked great for about a week than totally crapped out . 
this was more a processed and flattened with a steam roller product . 
this is not from beets and the taste is the proof of the num_extend
bali has other bras that are way better . 
this was after methodical applications of the uv protectant . 
this is totally worthless and made of really cheap and flimsy plastic . 
don t get me wrong ,  this cereal tastes delicious . 
if it works at all ,  it fails in a few months . 
the satisfaction of knowing a zombie is cornered just isn t there anymore . 
even my boyfriend commented that my hair smelt good . 
it s a well built phone and i prefer it over the evo . 
call back and person answered after about num_num rings . 
my friend took the skirt to a seamstress she knew . 
there are some twists in the story and surprises . 
the sound quality was not very good either . 
the search for a good replacement for the charmin continues . 
i orginally purchased downtown pet supply puppy pads and then tried these . 
using it through an android phone that other mics work fine through . 
the range of the num_extend is very very poor . 
some are better for the same or lower price . 
the product i received was not creamy and white like most reviews said . 
that s not such a great deal to me . 
they took them but weren t crazy about them . 
i think boos sends amazon the rejects just to get rid of them . 
if you need a scissors on your pocket knife ,  get a wenger . 
the side panels only have so much give . 
the mag clip does not accommodate the num_num other heaters i own . 
additionally ,  russell has no customer service to speak of . 
fit except they stretched easily and flop if not wearing socks . 
this is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated . 
at least the size was right and it arrived on schedule . 
i bought these shoes about a year ago . 
the game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayable . 
i tried this cake mix and it came out lacking . 
and there are next to no games to play for it . 
first time i used this pan i boiled potatoes . 
which really defeats the purpose of the product in the end . 
i also noticed that my hair didn t respond well to it . 
i wasn t very pleased with how this timer worked . 
we purchased another pair in a different color . 
this is the only one i would never trust . 
i used it once and will probably give it away . 
i wish i had known about this  feature  before purchasing this scanner . 
absolutely the worst test strips i have ever used . 
i tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail . 
perhaps in acrylic aquariums this product makes a difference . 
nobody could be so stupid as to do a thing like that unintentionally . 
but it served its purpose for the costume . 
so this thing is now in the trash . 
most vitamins and meds don t mess up my stomach . 
it overheats in about num_num minutes and shuts down . 
i d give it a higher rating if it actually worked . 
in fact ,  i couldn t see that it did anything at all . 
the vacuum also loses suction as the canister fills . 
the unit spins around constantly on the counter top . 
that might be the one to get when it s available . 
i followed directions but my nails still broke and split . 
do your homework before you take it as you should with all supplements . 
i have to butt in and give a mediocre rating . 
for some reason he hasn t taken to this at all . 
i bought it originally to make an at home vitamin c serum . 
if not ,  get a pair of danner acadias . 
i can t imagine children being able to do this on their own . 
the moles and gophers are supposedly repelled by the scent this leaves behind . 
i laid this game to rest to stop wasting my time . 
one cracked open and the other had huge imperfections . 
i can dry my whole range rover with the viking . 
the main advantage is the availability of software . 
i heard that castor oil works the best  didn t try it yet  . 
like many things that seem too good to be true ,  it was . 
the capacity isn t the problem ,  the problem is the bowl itself . 
kids drink this stuff nowadays ?  have they never tried coffee ?  . 
shipping was fast ,  but this product is not for me . 
this means creating new files or updating old ones . 
so it was a complete waste ,  and a total disappointment . 
i am hoping for a refund fromcvs ,  even though eight months old . 
i tried to contact the seller and they never responded back to me . 
i wanted a really small nose ring that i could wear to work . 
i ve been eating and enjoying them for almost four decades . 
the mold in peanuts is not as discernable as mold on bread . 
then suddenly you have to switch to using your left control . 
read all of the good reviews and liked the scope initially . 
the only thing is it doesn t have a cool air option . 
save up the cash and see a professional . 
the crate is lightweight ,  sturdy ,  easy to assemble and disassemble . 
when u flip it over the colors move to the other end . 
reeds like to stick very easy with this call . 
most of them were on the cheap side . 
really disgusted with this product on the first try . 
i also did not care for the material . 
i honestly don t feel this combo is worth any more than $
lumines and dynasty warriors both have this design feature . 
they were sorely disappointed in this thing and my friend was embarrased . 
i intend to call virbac back tomorrow and express my disappointment . 
hopefully ,  this isn t the new standard of nintendo games . 
 i bought the delux model by the way  . 
second ,  the microphone is located on the top . 
sadly ,  this also impacts the usability of the camera . 
the first time i played it when it was called turok . 
i am african american with natural num_extend hair . 
it just makes it feel gooey ,  and dull . 
these are just really for snorkeling but they do work for beginner divers . 
i won t order russell anymore with that much shrinkage . 
i bought this lantern for a cave exploring trip to peru . 
obviously the battery died and i couldn t use it . 
popped it into my num_extend and tried to use it . 
but on at least num_num occasion ,  this did not work . 
i am not interested in purchasing a product blind . 
if you want a firm solid shoe you found it . 
but then what happens ?  the control of the weapons is trash . 
it sticks out about an inch or so . 
i recommend buying the cheapest cf card that will work with your camera . 
my low rating is for this version only . 
it has very strong plastic smell almost like glue . 
do yourself a favor ,  skip this and get the armorsuit instead . 
my husband bought this for me ,  which i appreciate . 
despite the bad reviews ,  i also tried this pan . 
so i sent it back for a refund . 
the guns plastic seems like it came from the dollar tree . 
opened the package and found a broken mirror lens . 
i will no longer be getting any more color hair dye from anywhere . 
the power switch lacked the smooth secure feel of the original . 
one attempted battery change ,  and it was ruined . 
that was funny but the game is still a pile of fat fertilizer . 
thank god i only left it on the ends for num_num minutes . 
after about a year ,  the first button just stopped working . 
tom fords  black orchid  smells like over spiced spanish rice . 
which end is supposed to be fat ?  i don t know . 
therefore i can not comment on the unit . 
depending on the brand sneaker i wear a num_extend or an num_extend
how to set it is simply not clear at all . 
the mold that made them must have been defective . 
the spearmint flavor  same brand  is just fine ,  though . 
its just a cheap rubber wrap around your phone thing  :   . 
the medium is the size i should have gotten . 
i have had a lot of trouble with the controls . 
however ,  the whole for step two is just too big . 
i hooked up the second one and the exact same thing happened . 
i tasted this product at a friend s house . 
i d stick with those if you are looking to strengthen your foot . 
but its so flimsy that its hard to use . 
sadly ,  this mount was not designed for anything that big . 
i have a pair of these already in black and i love them . 
for the price there are much better perfumes . 
unfortunately ,  this soap has an ingredient that irritates my skin . 
i finally gave up and threw the whole mess into the trash . 
amazingly ,  the result is a product that appears to be totally artificial . 
you could push down on the case and it was visibly bubbled up . 
the inner box looks brand new ,  with no damage . 
the second cup will have a lot of silt and grounds in it . 
looks like hardware store chain for miniatures or crafts . 
i bought this because everyone raved about the taste and no aftertaste . 
i also have a large chipmunk population that creates other issues as well . 
this product is troublesome ,  unreliable and decidedly not recommended . 
unfortunately ,  we found that they were extremely difficult to put together . 
after rinsing i put another hair mask in my hair for num_num minutes . 
of course people think that feature is good because it s new . 
the parts do not fit properly to begin with . 
this device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws . 
you could be an architect and a marksman if you wanted . 
also ,  it takes at least to reflls to do the mouth . 
i tried the shampoo and the oil treatment . 
if they assist me with installation i will comeback and update my review . 
kitty developed urine crystals shortly after starting spot s stew . 
i actually bought a different one once i received this one . 
the blades were getting dull after about num_num years of use . 
both of the included batteries no longer hold a charge . 
once it s in the pot it won t read the temperature correctly . 
the matches are not water proof as i expected . 
the spoons are too blunt to really pierce the egg with . 
slowly my hair would just become a flat mass . 
it does have a threader portion but no cleaning portion like thorton . 
serious sam upgraded to a better engine  graphics  and ruined the entire game . 
it s been num_num months and the mice are still winning . 
halo pc supports over a dozen simultaneous players . 
they may smell nice but they perform mediocre at best . 
and yet ,  here i am ,  giving this a poor review . 
rings that come with it are also garbage . 
this product has num_num grams of carbs and only num_num of protein . 
it s so time consuming and such a hassle . 
well what can i say ,  i m a strong women . 
i ve even heard martha stewart say to do it . 
but there doesn t seem to be a happy medium on distance . 
i brought this can opener because my mother highly recomended it . 
i ended up throwing it out within a few days . 
as a shooter this game is just horrible . 
linksys customer service recommended the newer num_extend card which is made for desktops . 
after many times of resetting the person code i got it to work . 
and like i said ,  i m a real fan of your products . 
does not work the other way around to tight the filter . 
more importantly ,  this thing scratches up very quickly . 
you ll have to sit through the introduction num_extend
it also doesn t look like pad thai or taste like pad thai . 
this time it was a carpenter ant bite on my hand . 
i was surprised at so many positive reviews for this product . 
the sound quality is really very good ,  far better than the jawbone num_extend
that s the main reason i decided to replace it . 
red rain purports itself to be an energy drink . 
the consistency is a wheat germ meal with an awful old lady smell . 
the explore mode can be a little disturbing . 
sometimes i get complaints from people saying they can t hear me . 
i bought num_num packs for a total of num_num protectors . 
i have a galaxy num_extend with the basic otter box . 
worse yet ,  sony ericsson will do nothing to support their device . 
but i didn t have any problems with installation . 
the plug in configuration was at the expense of unplugging the speakers . 
they probably need to recall the toy and start over . 
i believe it it made for the desire only . 
it turns out i didn t need the cutters after all . 
i have num_num wireless tracballs and num_num broken controllers . 
heed the rather large warning labels on the box please . 
still ,  for the money i liked it and was happy . 
it s not even going to be joining my list of decent rpgs . 
it would be like an adult walking around with swim fins . 
i am going to try the actual powder next time . 
all that s left is the braided flex metal sheathing . 
my friends are ultra impressed with theirs but i m less than thrilled . 
we kept one but i wish we took both back . 
in very small print the country of origin is disclosed . 
i found the difficulty balance here to be about right . 
i would give it num_num stars ,  but probably won t buy again . 
the packaging directs you to a memorex site that is defunct . 
the first thing i noticed is the very strong scent . 
when the item came ,  the batteries were already dead . 
i would return it ,  but threw out the packaging . 
only the thin chocolate coating has a sweet taste . 
also ,  definitely hard to clean ,  very messy  per other reviews  . 
with the new battery he could not get a signal . 
i do not think gatorade tastes bad to give you a comparison . 
the hard plastic case arrived on time and in good condition . 
you re better off looking for better microwavable plates . 
covergirl lashblastfusion mascara says this is their biggest brush ever . 
it s not wide enough for a somewhat overweight person . 
the purple on the website looks nothing like what it actually is . 
my product has a yet smaller usb like connector . 
this grinder has stopped working after only a few months of use . 
over all ,  buy a better one so yeah . 
there is no real point to the game . 
the game will crash if you get a high score . 
if i could give this item zero stars i would . 
num_num of the num_num are now in the trash . 
they stretch out of shape after a few hours . 
i unplugged it immediately and threw it in the trash . 
from the moment i began playing this game i was extremely dissapointed . 
next time i m going to try another brand s penny loafers . 
i returned that unit and ordered a third unit . 
the fit is strange ,  it does not have good support . 
saw so many good reviews so i bought the biggest bottle . 
don t see it lasting much longer than a few months . 
after a few years of sparingly using this toolkit . 
this dye turns sort of a dark forest green color when it activates . 
advertised num_num num_num mg capsules of buffered  vitamin  c . 
num_extend was the only thing it would ever display . 
this is how you see the full capability of the camcorder capture . 
other than that ,  it is a good product . 
my cats ,  themselves ,  just weren t interested in it . 
the knife looks great and so does the sheath . 
the ai and the graphics are not even close to next generation . 
but it all seems that i will eventually return it . 
it was a gift from their num_num year old cousin . 
the product i received was nothing like the pictures . 
the first time ,  he was twisted around ,  practically on his head . 
i make it a point not to buy from companies that charge postage . 
i got this shirt for my husband because it seemed pretty cheap . 
sorry ,  gold kili ,  but i think this stuff is awful . 
that is why they bought the licencse to the nfl . 
do yourself a favor and check out anker s batteries . 
that is why i am a loyal amazon customer . 
i don t plan on purchasing this item again . 
it has features that i would prefer over the creative system . 
when i opened the package it had a weird scent like vinegar . 
color is only a very slightly different shade of white . 
but it soon num_extend it is turn based combat . 
the colors are bright and fun but that s about it !  . 
this is not dual voltage and you d have to use a converter . 
i think i ve got num_num dungeons left to go . 
this is just noodles and the vegetable is more of a garnish . 
this toy doesn t need a hammer at all . 
the first problem occurred about num_num months after purchase . 
it was lemony ,  sure ,  but it was also really spicy . 
my hair eats oil and grease for lunch . 
this game could of been a great strategy game . 
i contacted the amazon manfacture and have had no response !  . 
it also suck the sand out of my aquarium . 
maybe a whole bunch of these were dropped . 
please don t learn the hard way like i did . 
i ll see for the num_num day warranty if panasonic makes the change . 
on top and bottom it is sharp enough to split open your hand . 
it seemed to have the exact opposite effect . 
hopefully accessory export would make its product more quality . 
finally it did work with a sanyo nimh . 
we tried num_num of these and talked with manufacturers support . 
maybe i had my expectations set a bit too high . 
the fda just isn t doing much oversight at all of foriegn food . 
the hoods don t fit right so my dogs heads get wet . 
i m really puzzled why so many reviewers seem to like it . 
camera kept tiping over  it weighs num_extend lbs with lens  . 
the seller apologized and immediately shipped out another one . 
the picture seems to show dehydrated chunks of meat and peas . 
these used to taste like baby ruth s .  . now are horrible . 
this was the last one on the shelf ,  as well . 
i didn t see that this product did much for my arthritis pain . 
then it wouldn t even turn on after one week . 
even with the correct grip ,  the curl feature just stinks . 
if you are hanging sturdy fabrics ,  this is for you . 
i bought these today at walmart ,  and they are terrible . 
both my husband and i tossed it after just one sip . 
the environments are large and exciting ,  the puzzles clever . 
this was not the one to buy for many reasons . 
a very pretty white timer but it does not work . 
its just as effective and more gentle on the cable using pliers . 
they did comment on how clean i kept this unit . 
when i clean the glass moving around in the ring . 
it also doesn t seem to be an authentic product . 
i donated it to a neighbor who used it . 
the normal version of the ipod is the best you can find . 
just stop right now and go look at marineland emperor power filters . 
but they leak !  beware of foods with sauce or liquids . 
cuts open boxes great ,  slices up cardboard fine . 
these were miscut and idd not align properly . 
the colors are nice ,  but that s about it on these . 
if your not absolutely sure dont buy it . 
i ll go back to the drug store stuff . 
i recently purchased a bunch of polishes in this color family . 
if you have to use a num_num oz . 
then ,  super agent  mako  walks in and basically just ended the game . 
the whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player . 
this is the fourth timex ironman i have owned . 
i won t buy this again any more  ,  cheap cheap cheap . 
the power kept shutting off within ten seconds of turning it on . 
it looks as if i had snapped it of in the computer . 
my son is a top crossfit athlete with access to the best gear . 
the issue is in the grip i believe . 
toshiba has shot itself in the foot with this one . 
i never felt so good freeing up space on my hard drive . 
i feel good that they are as environmentally friendly as you can get . 
saitek num_extend have some of the same problem ,  but not as badly . 
i don t like the levels and the powers you can get . 
the website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to harman . 
package arrived on time ,  no issues with overall quality . 
also ,  since it falls over easily ,  it requires constant parental supervision . 
well it looks like ground up lawn grass . 
this one lasted longer than other ones  usually gone in num_num minutes  . 
it does not chop; although ,  it does split wood . 
we probably had it only a month before it stopped working . 
although they normally love grass ,  they won t touch this thing . 
the halo like health system also made the game much easier . 
your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances . 
again ,  this is a real piece of junk . 
they are not scary unless maybe your num_num well probably not even then . 
really wanted to like this ,  but am returning . 
this bar has the makings of a good protein bar . 
if you buy the fuji num_extend you ll be soorrreeee !  . 
then you remember that you have to press and hold . 
i figure since it was a jawbone it would be great . 
however ,  the  bluebell  products do list  fragrance  natural   in their ingredients . 
but she said she would just wear thicker socks . 
where was it when i was in my teens ?  ?  ?  ?  . 
lying on it to prevent reflux didn t work well for me . 
i have not seen amazon carry this old style . 
the strap is too short to be usable . 
also they managed to put in puzzle solving inside some boss fights . 
i was unable to find salt so i tried a fed more bites . 
so people can see your underwear ,  or worse . 
i have bought the lollipops and candy drops in other flavors . 
buy a lifestraw instead ,  they last way longer . 
i m with the dangerous camp on this one . 
i did not even dear to bike in it . 
it won t even ft in my range bag . 
in all honesty they didn t seem interested in providing customer assistance . 
these are very flimsy ,  and they don t stay closed . 
bought two sets for a trip coming up in december . 
the sides are so weak that it broke the first week . 
they have great instructions and a well done video on you tube . 
i wouldn t feed this stuff to my pets . 
the body wash and lotion are just ok . 
so as a treat ,  thumbs up  although they dried quickly  . 
they rub between the toes with a harsh stiffness . 
i went with waring because they used to make quality products . 
the least likeable item was the salmon spread . 
the cutscenes are great ,  the gameplay ,  however ,  isn t . 
one of them just decided it was a pillow . 
use exactly the ingredients as the manual suggested . 
every little movement can be heard rooms away . 
just received speedo goggles and no more double vision . 
i was surprised because my dog loves squeaky toys and balls . 
nice look but construction quality isnt up to par . 
very disappointing especially since this was a gift . 
thought i would save some money on a wall safe . 
 you just bounce a ball on it .  .  .   she declared . 
i got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly . 
it looks awesome ,  it just plays like crap . 
this killed many orders i would have made . 
unfortunately ,  these guys are going in the garbage . 
i took that part away from my son . 
i was pleased to see this one did not . 
we bought one and it kept blowing circuit breakers . 
this is identical to having thugs come in and smash your computer . 
no thanks !  unfortunately ,  this is not a precision styling tool . 
not worth the $ but thank god it wasn t more money . 
slightly improved over ffx  my favorite ff and video game btw  . 
another problem has been the front usb ports . 
we go through a lot of garlic in our cooking . 
i have had it for a while but barely used it . 
the company would not do anything about this either . 
this horrible tasting thing has num_num calories and a whole bushel of fat . 
the back label ,  which supposedly should be leather ,  cardboard seems now . 
i m too lazy to recalibrate for this pitcher . 
then the problem is how to hold the cheese . 
only time will tell how long they last . 
the company should fire anyone who was paid to test this . 
i am a huge fan of the gauntlet series by midway . 
the marble slicer is much smaller than the beach wood slicer . 
i ve used other dry shampoos that work much better . 
i can t say that i noticed any huge difference . 
measurement compared to one to one taken manually . 
the packaging states that it s safe for silver plated jewelry . 
used them a few times but not even every month . 
the game has been well received ,  and maybe it s just me . 
first off ,  i m sure this supplement is harmless . 
this is the biggest drawback and design flaw . 
maybe neither will work and you need something different . 
after reading the reviews ,  this looked like a pretty good buy . 
it s just as bad as mk mythologies and mk shaolin monks . 
they have more eyeliner and mascara than a streetwalker . 
usually land up charging one at a time . 
something like you would see at a convenient store . 
let s say i want to buy my dog some cool toys . 
very stylish too except i don t think they make it anymore . 
what a piece of crap for this price point . 
i was enticed by the low price and decent reviews this trimmer received . 
you cannot sharpen it ,  because the case is plastic coated . 
i mean really ,  it comes from an animal . 
this stuff isthe soylent green of the future . 
other s are advertised as built to last ,  they are not . 
beware , this cable can only transfer data from a pc . 
looked good at first ,  turns a nasty yellow in about a week . 
gun is also brittle plastic literately crumbled in my hands . 
not sure if manufacturing defect or if item was used or damaged . 
i went from no zits to num_num in a week . 
when you trust a picture you re always going to be letdown . 
it s been about num_num months and wanted to update my review . 
this does not make for a good replacement . 
again ,  anything i receive that originates in china will automatically be returned . 
you can lead your troops during a battle . 
it took me a few minutes to figure it out . 
it s too small around the chest and too big in the cups . 
the entire box of truffles had a whitish residue on them . 
document just got stick in the print queue under xp and windows num_extend
it dries very long and doesn t protect nail polish from chipping . 
i bought this because a beauty guru on youtube was using it . 
we have num_num big dogs ,  that leave big and small num_extend
the older model with mechanical rollers was much better . 
i also like my new one because it has taller feet . 
the challenge is to use your ingenuity to cope with your present circumstance . 
the character customization is the only thing i really enjoyed . 
but think about the things you can buy for that money instead . 
so soft every shot looked poor and out of focus . 
ordered two of these ,  and am moderately content with one of them . 
the paper glued on pressed cardboard is not lasting . 
it s a shame because what i got before was delicious . 
i recall reading something like this about this product or something similar . 
i thought it just made my coffee taste like paper . 
i bought a ph meter and it worked fine . 
they are just too tight and pinch my ears . 
this one did not last very long at all . 
i have a feeling that someone at that company stole my card info . 
you d be better off with just the slide side . 
even in the open ,  it picks up very few stations . 
the lid had a huge crack after the first use . 
i washed it ,  which didn t help the smell . 
this one will not stay tuned ,  it is the design . 
this headset works good as far as call quality on the other end . 
please make all food vendors give you an ingredients list . 
so i got her a new phone and threw this one away . 
i dropped it this morning on the floor  tile  and the case broke . 
it was a total waste of my money . 
i don t feel much stretching in my spine . 
there are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this . 
even their laptop wireless adapter works great for me . 
no complaints will purchase from them again and recommend to others . 
i use the plastic tape to label my spice jars . 
be warned ,  this teleconverter does not fit all nikon lenses . 
simply put ,  this is just a terrible looking game . 
unfortunately ,  nothing in this game really earns a special mention . 
i would stick to regular fish oil without any flavor . 
after a week ,  we just threw it away . 
use a power a lot ,  and it levels up . 
seems to me ,  they have already been tested . 
lost its  luster the first time i washed them . 
oh my god ,  yes the graphics are amazing . 
i used it for one week and i really wish i could return . 
there are no ingredients listed on the bottle which makes me skeptical . 
it is impossible to rate  vice city  without comparing it to gta num_extend
no way could i serve that in a candy dish . 
i decided that i couldn t trust the packaging . 
he crawled after it and then it bonked him in the head . 
i will be looking for another manufactuer when i next order this product . 
it sounds like a good idea ,  but it s the complete opposite . 
i read and read and read about zma . 
i expected a lot more from high sierra . 
i will be donating the remaining num_num boxes to an area food bank . 
after blowing it up ,  it was smaller than expected . 
didn t like that it died in num_num months . 
save your money and invest in a nicer brand ,  . 
absolutely love how it is customizable and adjustable . 
i d be careful about using this around the neck and face . 
thought this would be a much tougher toy . 
real stainless steel is supposed to not rust . 
i wasn t a big fan of the burnout series . 
i give my bikila ls num_num stars plus but these only a meager num_extend
may the force be with you and guide your dollars elsewhere . 
they are in the garbage dump right now . 
i am a big fan of coffee and cappuccino . 
the middle prongs also broke on me !  had to trash it . 
i would look for something with tighter connections . 
i thought the  perfect it  cream  step num_extend would work . 
it works about one time out of num_extend
i followed the recharge cycle as instructed and am pleased with the battery . 
secondary to that ,  however ,  is the absence of scent . 
plant an acorn and return to see it become a num_extend
i thought it was going to last longer . 
this toy was not to my kids  tastes . 
i get about a % seal rate on the internal check valve . 
we got this for my son s num_extend birthday . 
memorex is in the trash right where it belongs . 
it vacuums up beautifully and doesn t become part of the carpet . 
this is very evident in electronic arts  port of goldeneye :  rogue agent . 
this makes pulling the hose out a nightmare . 
the pouch could be useful to me so i decided to save it . 
i thought to myself that there was nothing to lose . 
too tight in the toe box ,  too loose in the heel . 
sub standard cables ,  not the belkin quality i have come to expect . 
i returned this mouse to the store within num_num hours of buying it . 
i even see that users of the iphone num_num say the same thing . 
i figured it is the cheapo plastic stock . 
you have to open the flap to use it . 
this product tastes like it has a high amount of alcohol in it . 
if you look at a peg ,  it may fall out . 
on a bad day ,  the battery lasts less than num_num hours . 
at such a high price ,  it s very disappointing . 
i began adding num_num packs of stevia in the raw . 
so no routing calls through your google voice . 
so i cannot honestly say that this product did anything for me . 
constant static whether from a radio or cd . 
some people may feel this product works fine ,  but not for me . 
i got this product for my daughter who has mild asthma . 
i am really ,  really disappointed in this product . 
it randomly took off on its own on several occasions . 
these plastic ones were allocated to my son s play kitchen . 
the only thing this coffee has related to kahlua is the logo . 
i tried it on the cd player again and the same thing . 
the pin pusher on mine broke while sizing a bracelet . 
i see from another review mine is not an isolated case . 
that are now mandatory ,  and must be administered by one player class . 
this product did not fit my need of transporting lantus and aphidra pens . 
they do not warn . i have been cooking a long time . 
had the added benefit of being electronic ,  e . g . 
when this happens ,  it becomes impossible to turn the headset off . 
i swear to god that is exactly what this is . 
not useful unless you are walking on carpet at all times . 
i purchased this unit based on owning a prior sennheiser headset . 
i would have gave it a num_num if i could . 
the bust support is ok for one day until fabric stretches . 
space matters !  the charge plate takes up a lot of space . 
sometimes you can take num_num steps and get attacked . 
i well be looking for a better model asap . 
i eagerly grabbed my hairspray and followed the directions . 
it made me constipated because it is not made from whole grains . 
it s stable when laid flat and you can hang it as well . 
i have a num_extend checked the micro adjustments ,  cleaned the contacts ,  . 
the ants we have here ignore these baits . 
it s kindof an awkward shape too so it s hard to store . 
the bodum arrived with the  retractable  cord unable to be extended . 
they speak down to their customers ,  and will call them names . 
i won t buy this body wash again for this one reason . 
i think it will shake more if the bread recipe was bigger . 
i bought these for a science camp ,  even after reading the reviews . 
the headphones fit poorly; actually drop off my head if i bend over . 
don t waste your money ,  your time and your phone . 
i guess sugar has been around so long for a reason . 
i really hoped to like this but it is just o . k . 
i was in a rush so i jumped to a bad item . 
honestly i don t know how to rate these . 
take a cutting diagonal from the mother plant . 
i found the sound to be sub par . 
in attempt to fix the problem i naturally applied more . 
i sprayed all over ,  every day ,  and still got mosquito bites . 
if you tap the dial ,  it will start again . 
one is a hard plastic model ,  which is extremely inflexible . 
i really wish i went with the $ more expensive gold plated cord . 
the previous reviewers said it wouldn t work ,  and they were right . 
they are not the best quality and they have this horrible odor . 
the tuning dial must be adjusted to get the best reception . 
don t buy this game !  you will regret it later !  . 
the indian kitchen products are much ,  much better . 
the milk doesn t help get cardboard taste out of it . 
the color in the before and after pic is not accurate . 
personally ,  i would like to have seen more courts . 
i m sure it would work on a european snes . 
 with num_num dogs ,  you know how expensive that was  . 
with the crosman ,  two and even three shots to do the job . 
the only positive about this earpiece is that it s pretty . 
my chop wizard is hard to clean but is more useful then this . 
nearly all atari num_num games have more complexity and game play . 
i just played the demo to this game . 
plus ,  running the studio is often interrupted by an awards ceremony . 
take left on xyz street ,  and it was some ones drive way . 
this thing just has such a weak ,  weak charge . 
green is firmer but not as tasty as red . 
so ea s omission is either intentional or lazy . 
i m not sure if they were near expiration . 
when i got this item ,  it looked used ,  not new . 
i dislike products marketed by pretending they might be healthy for you . 
also the game will not connect online or to the servers . 
the taste ,  however ,  is very bland and unsatisfying . 
it does or did work for playing fetch with merlyn the australian shepherd . 
it definitely is not for lg dvd writers . 
i am guessing there are no rocket launchers either . 
for me ,  this stuff consistently gave me a stomach ache . 
these were very old like late num_extend speakers . 
this saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated . 
if you have dirty man nails look elsewhere ,  gents . 
putting it in my pocket ,  plugging it in ,  whatever . 
talk to a senior tech support person . install from cd . 
i even used two bags in a mug and still it s weak . 
we also have local raw honey ,  but they were out . 
however ,  they thought it was funny when it crashed on the roof . 
this would have been a terrific product and it is a great idea . 
you can no longer see how much product is remaining in the bottle . 
i said  whoa !  i m gonna like this game !  unfortunately . 
i would just stay far away as possible from this item . 
the ones with more shapes are obviously more educational . 
it got rancid pretty quick ,  and this is not cheap . 
my ear got sore from me trying it on so often . 
you ll save money ,  and you ll get exactly what you want . 
about three weeks later it stopped charging my phone a;; together . 
i am so giving and buy at store next time . 
after having a discussion with q about metal ,  q suggests he leave . 
it s hard to handle and the ends keep coming off . 
its comfortable as it is really so very baggy . 
if you breath at all in your googles they fog in different areas . 
the first ,  and most positive concept ,  is to introduce something groundbreaking . 
no signs of anything on screen in a very clean room . 
i attempted to contact the seller to let him know of my experience . 
i am pretty picky about what they eat and this was a mistake . 
get espn num_num becuase its better then this lame title . 
the buttons on the side are not aligned with the cutout . 
squeezed it out ,  and rubbed it on my face . 
i am visually impaired and rely on a monocular for everyday use . 
i was so sad because the bra was so comfortable . 
my cats have been eating welness chicken recipe for quite some time . 
just be aware of the garbanzo flour ,  it s a bit much . 
the chocolate was discolored and the cookies were broken apart . 
the smell from this product is still on my skin num_num hours later . 
im actually back here looking for a new case . 
my son had one just like it but our dogs ate it . 
all they do is push the dust around . 
the licorice i ate later is really making me feel a little gross . 
i also experienced the problem with the cap not staying on the bottle . 
i m still finding fluffs of the stuffing under furniture weeks later . 
but the price point is too low to make anything of quality . 
very convenient for measuring exact amounts without wasting ,  and economical . 
it does the same thing ,  as described by others . 
also ,  there are severeal glitches in the game . 
thanks for making it easy to return this stuff ,  amazon . 
i know for a fact that a lot of sellers are running scams . 
by no means am i just ragging on the system for no reason . 
the bottle says ivory on it ,  but it is so orange . 
i then attached the other end of this wire to the new battery . 
had to remove and bag up the whole box to return . 
my kids love the little animals but wouldn t touch the platform part . 
hopefully the dreadful taste will help keep most people away . 
has lots of plastic but then again ,  so does my honda . 
even bring it back again and again if he s in the mood . 
my puppy is teething now and just chews on this pal . 
it would be comfortable if it wasn t leaking . 
the graphics are excellent ,  but game play is too slow and boring . 
i placed six of these around my ants . 
i remember this game being much more fun when i was little . 
i d recommend upgrading to a different system for this game . 
the ending is almost just as bad . the graphics are pretty good . 
the unit looks cool but the sound leaves much to be desired . 
it is pink with orange which means it s coral ,  not red . 
worked for around num_num minutes out of the box . 
but the company did put my money back on my card . 
after a few months of daily use ,  the switch quit working . 
do yourself a favor and buy the expensive one . 
for the high price of num_extend brokeone usb charge plate broke off . 
i prefer the class farming feel of the previous games . 
they don t want you to enjoy this game without buying the wii . 
it doesn t seem to make a difference at all . 
i would not recommend this item to anybody . 
i gave this air soft rifle to my grandson for christmas . 
as of this morning ,  everyone is getting back to normal . 
the handle design is pretty good and easy to manipulate the can . 
it is thin thin thin and not at all worth the price . 
i would not buy this clipper again nor recommend it . 
i got it this morning and will be trading it in tomorrow . 
then about a month in ,  it stopped turning on . 
i have bought num_num of these in the past num_num months . 
they fit really well and were very comfortable . 
my machine worked great for a few weeks . 
for the price ,  this knife was a huge letdown . 
the flakes were almost wax like ,  but smelled very good . 
 other than the fact that you may secretly be mr . 
quite a far cry from the iphone and other windows mobile phones . 
i am so glad i didn t pay full price for this . 
programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog . 
the scent is not as it was when originally made . 
then one of the input  up arrow  buttons stopped working . 
she always ended up adjusting me when i went in . 
and then i took like num_num tsps more . 
very disappointed actually ,  since it is supposed to made in germany . 
whoever came up with this crappy redesign should be kicked in the nuts . 
the same goes for their power cleaning technology . 
i should not have bought this book the first place i saw it . 
it looks far more realistic than most toy instruments . the num_extend
this vest rated to fit num_num to num_num lb kids . 
the green toys tool box is leaps and bounds better than this one . 
also ,  the length of charge seems to be getting less and less . 
i would pass on this razor unless you have a light beard . 
i can t just push or lift my selector valve to operate it . 
i just spent a very frustrating half hour putting these together . 
he loves building things out of legos ,  marble towers . 
they are thinner ,  much thinner ,  and oily tasting . 
i really thought that this product would be like momma used to make . 
the legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline . 
i bought this overpriced item because of the rave reviews . 
had a headache for a few days and stopped taking immediately thereafter . 
i had high hopes for this case but it completely let me down . 
i have had the zojirushi coffee maker for over num_num months now . 
that is why badger is better than most . 
they were almost impossible to put on so i returned them . 
so i first ordered another plantronics num_extend that was decently reviewed on amazon . 
lots like this one and swissco makes quality combs so worth a try . 
the customer service replaced my mount without any problem . 
i would not purchase any of the konad pearl polishes for stamping . 
i bought two of these to use in my clinic . 
my iq is still down a num_num points but who cares . 
when you go to different districts you get a job . 
it was just too lose ,  no matter how tight you pulled it . 
there is only one acceptable armor ,  and a handful of acceptable weapons . 
it is trying to cough up a hairball . 
it has been decided that the practical outweighs the cool factor . 
the beans seem to just cease entering the grinder periodically . 
when we started playing ,  the butterflies took forever to shoot out . 
nope ,  sorry folks ,  it didn t work for me . 
however on opening the package i found the bottle almost empty . 
we bought this blender on their recommendation despite reports of broken plastic teeth . 
my dog ate through the material very quickly and left quite a mess . 
their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities . 
i have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems . 
the instructions were clear stating a small amount makes one gallon of snow . 
while shopping for the ingredients ,  i found this blend . 
will stay away from all netgear s product from now . 
the tabs leave a film that you can t remove . 
qed it won t work with the onkyo receivers . 
using this remote shutter release seemed like the obvious choice . 
the size is big ,  but not too big . 
whoever designed these did not try them on or wash them . 
it is obvious they didnt use a shoe model . 
i know better than to buy items that are obviously cheap imports . 
i can t believe they get such great ratings . 
and it would constantly lose and hunt for signal . 
if i could give them less then one star i would . 
maybe i got a defective unit ,  but this product is absolutely useless . 
nothing like turning a defective camera into a profit center . 
what a hassle ,  it s not worth the effort . 
charge is not held as in the panasonic product . 
it may be right for a smaller ,  lighter person . 
when it stops working ,  good luck with getting customer support for help . 
but the really bad news was yet to come . 
tore when i tried to put my tablet inside . 
fisher price is supposed to be an excellent brand that means quality . 
was not what i expected shouldve known you get what you pay for . 
they feel good ,  look good ,  but fall apart . 
i can t believe all of the positive reviews on this product . 
my advice to new puppy owners is housebreak immediately for the outside . 
my ears always hurt once i take these off . 
this game should have never been released with all these bugs . 
so cute ,  but cheaply made and didn t last . 
wish it worked for me ,  but it didn t . 
i would feel like an idiot on the beach in this thing . 
such a shame ,  it s so cute but totally unusable . 
this is a neat accessories to have but the quality is subpar . 
the bag shows big chunks of beef ,  carrots ,  peas ,  etc . 
my recommendation ,  stay as far away from this frightful thing as possible . 
don t know if they will ever call me back . 
i saw mixed reviews on amazon ,  but went ahead and bought it . 
i had never had a problem and they made my eyes feel great . 
more than % of what i paid !  $ speakers have now become $
based on others  reviews i thought this would better withstand his chewing . 
it might do for a tiny dog if it s older and calm . 
but after the very first wash ,  all of the labels fell off . 
five of us played that game  my four children and i  . 
the smell was extremely unpleasant upon opening the package . 
they were not broken ,  but the taste is terrible . 
i though it was going to be richer ,  creamier ,  and thicker . 
until then my money will remain in my pocket . 
even this one which is their lowest cost one is very very good . 
you build businesses which just sit there and make money . 
i just found this game to be kinda boring . 
they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china . 
my review is of dlink ,  the company ,  and their release practices . 
not sure what the point of that is . 
spigen make superior cases ,  buy from them or get an otterbox . 
however ,  i offer this as general advise on the product alone . 
this provides unmatched stability and ease of use ,  from my experience . 
let me know when the shipping is not off the charts . 
they were very tough and my teenage boys would not eat them . 
volume was ok but could have been louder . 
definitely not what i d call  hi fidelity  reproduction . 
for some reason ,  this one just doesn t hit the notes right . 
my miniature dachshund wasn t too thrilled with the bed . 
definitely do not recommend you get what you pay for . 
if you are quite strong ,  possible this will work for you . 
and i see that many others have experienced this as well . 
for me num_extend it gave me banana boobs . 
in comparison ,  the fruit d or flavor is really intensely blueberry . 
even the camera isn t up to the task . 
we bought two of these incipio cases less than a year ago . 
this barely made it past the num_extend quarter panel . 
every game i know of allows a player to customize the controls . 
i just received the plug and gave it a try on my nano . 
the graphics are a small con ,  but still affect the game nonetheless . 
if you can smell it ,  it has unacceptable levels of toxicity . 
several attempts followed to get this thing to work . 
the plastic belt clip is of no value . 
it saddens me everyone else is so pysched about this game too . 
this radio receives am ,  fm and all seven weather alert vhf channels . 
i am a real fan of ginger and honey . 
the pasta is adequately al dente after microwaving . 
another stupid thing is the missions are way too long . 
for one the internal memory is only num_extend with a num_extend sd card . 
reliance needs to step up the quality of their products . 
will not buy this again or even try to take back . 
in fact ,  it all looks the same pretty much everywhere you go . 
in truth ,  i finished the six levels in breathtaking time . 
this thing promises network monitoring ,  vlans ,  and bandwidth control . 
downside :  will not protect camera from dust and other fine particle . 
too bulky for anyone with a real business sense . 
i love that this product is natural and has a delicious smell . 
my sister had one and i did too . 
i had no roots showing and the overall coverage was really great . 
dragon quest isn t so much difficult as it is a time sink . 
that having been said ,  i cannot begin to understand why . 
i only use these pads when it s raining outside or very cold . 
i was trying to replace a discontinued bra . 
works when it wants as opposed to when i want . 
i guess they just like the  catching  part . 
i own several pairs of num_extend num_extend num_num and num_extend
you really need to run the wheat through several times . 
there have to be better wireless cards out there . 
i think it caused more scaly skin ,  made her itchy . 
i just ignored it and had a bowl of frosted flakes . 
i found this game to be just so so . 
there s no trick and no fun in this one . 
many apps on the google store will indicate not compatible with this device . 
the smell isn t going away easily . so good luck to everyone . 
poshe has worked for many ,  i just wasn t one of them . 
is a bit much for a num_num and num_num year old . 
i also didn t want to go through the hassle of ordering again . 
you could beat the entire game in under three hours . 
i was quite disappointed in hanes brand of panties . 
i am a woman that can deal with pain . 
it ground the first and second time ,  the third it quit . 
this dead mouse is going back to amazon for a refund . 
they arrived quickly and they are super cute boxes . 
mine came with scratches ,  stray paint marks ,  and greasy finger prints . 
i think i will go back to towels . 
for the free subscription you can listen to voicemail and hear weather . 
it s an ingenious product ,  but i won t be purchasing one . 
you then have to reset to your last save . 
what could possibly substantiate a two star review ?  unfortunately . 
the sound effects of automatic weapons sound even better than in num_extend
cookie doughs seems almost too hard for it too . 
after a cumulative num_num minutes ,  i gave up . 
once done ,  it still looked good so life went back to normal . 
yes the music is extremely repetetive although nice at first . 
even then ,  i could have lived with the glitter . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
also ,  they were difficult to fit on top of the cones . 
throwing it out ,  just because it was reviewed here so highly . 
but when i ordered it on amazon ,  nope . 
i don t recommend ,  spend more for higher quality . 
the kids will play with that alot more . 
unfortunately ,  my daughter doesn t care for the system itself . 
it is kind of pricey and has an off flavor . 
i never even tried to see if it worked . 
maybe it is my unit ,  but i would not buy it again . 
the grape ones were better ,  which is why i bought these . 
it is better than nothing ,  but only slightly . 
this was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process . 
i will stick to my trusty shiseido or tweezerman curler . 
its a nice neutral colour but not what i was hoping for . 
i did that for a week and a half . 
not exactly the blazing speeds which were promised . 
it also has a thinner front post ,  which is nice . 
put on your leather gloves and try and get it away from them . 
i had this for two days before returning it . 
these are encapsulated with some form of gelatin . 
the seams inside are very rough and poorly made . 
i m returning it and am contemplating purchasing another one . 
tried to fit on my glock and the rubber get broke . 
simple enough to use ,  but the speaker sounds harsh and distorted . 
i bought this because of the convenient size . 
on the num_extend the buttons were bigger and easier to find and press . 
dents easily and the carry case fell apart . 
well you get what you pay for and this is no exception . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
the cars also don t resemble anything from the real world . 
people could not hear me properly when i used it to make phone num_extend
sorry ,  but it didn t work and tasted beyond gross . 
they say if it ain t broke ,  then don t fix it . 
this is an over priced kit for what it was supose to due . 
have ordered some other brands but never this one again . 
we switched to vxl . the motor has great power . 
we used to build cabins and pastures and barns and outbuildings . 
if you expect to be able to receive a signal . 
thats it folks ,  wwe and thq are no more . 
be careful when ordering as you might not get whats pictured . 
spend an extra $ and get the digital one for $
i finally stopped using it and bought a separate grinder . 
when i recieved i opened the package only to find a terrible smell . 
nothing much to say ,  but there are many sizes . 
i get duplicates by the tons and ,  worse ,  deleted contacts . 
something in that flimsy rear connector gave out . 
i wish i could buy a grinder made in the usa !  !  . 
it will not make a sound and that disappoints me . 
she is obsessed with our laptop ,  but doesn t like this one . 
i am very disappointed in this particular shaper . 
its a very poor experience . the quest system is also poorly done . 
yes ,  it does happen mostly in airports or on the train . 
i read osiris  review about needing the num_extend patch ,  that is incorrect . 
the charging port door is designed to sit flush down when closed . 
the local store  not walmart  had the whole unit new for $
one of the reviews says you get six pairs of socks . 
i did not have any problems with older mice . 
you ll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool . 
amazon should correct this by getting twinings to send updated images . 
pointless to have dual usb if you cannot charge all apple devices . 
it could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash . 
we took sifter out and said  we ll scoop any day  . 
i decided to order a replacement from amazon . 
i should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering . 
i ve never had a game that so regularly crashes my xbox . 
a pill is so much easier for folks like me . 
like two hours later i had barely something on my eye . 
gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization num_num to num_extend
i found it easy to use and it works well . 
if i could give this a zero star . 
we are really hoping it was just a bad batch . 
piece of crap ,  the ear pads keep coming off . 
the game only lasts a tad over num_num hours . 
it will only last for one season and its  effetiveness was minimal . 
they have never vomited on any other food . 
madden num_num was the first game i purchased for the num_extend
i had commanche gold but that was good for beginers . 
the pillow is too small and the velcro strip won t stay put . 
it was hard to even taste the fudge drizzled on the top . 
this is a num_extend person adventure game with some platforming thrown in . 
i travel from house to house delivering and teaching about medical devices . 
it nearly took my head off it was that close . 
manufacturers must be very diligent in all aspects of production to ensure quality . 
but short and simple this knife is really pretty and cool looking . 
this is not an impressive product after several uses . 
for sound ,  i can hear ,  but it is muffled . 
overall i am very disappointed in this toy . 
i used it just only one time and put it in the closet . 
sometimes it would recognize them and at other times it would not . 
i ve used the equate version in num_num day and num_num day . 
i have had this watch for about num_num months . 
i never had this problem with coffee people and will try them again . 
it has a fresh ,  coconut taste and is very smooth . 
as audiophile i ve always been familiar with the harman kardon brand . 
it is extremely difficult to remove this stuff from hair and cloth . 
they also contain a weird ingredient; corn malodextrin . 
kind of like going back to the early days of windows num_extend
recently the service neutral power line was broken in a storm . 
too bad bushnell puts their good name on junk like this . 
that worked for a week or two and the sound was mediocre . 
another purchase that i would rate num_num if possible . 
now ,  i am in nature miracle and works great . 
the texture is like that of a hard pita chip . 
this is supposed to be a m>f extension cable . 
its meant to be played as a mean joke . 
i could not get my foot into the shoe . 
which makes it the most expensive box of granola bars ever . 
i just wish i had my $ back . 
the dry shampoo was extremely difficult to apply myself . 
its a shame the fda does not regulate these companies . 
i literally had no idea what was going on . 
she used to enjoy it and actually looked forward to getting one . 
i contacted to plextor tech support and told me to update my usb . 
this time i m going to get and incipio case . 
and it looks like a lot of other people love these . 
i was deciding between this corkscrew and another on amazon for around $
i just don t have the patience any more . 
the scent is nice ,  but not for me . 
even if you have two spies in every provence . 
i have one computer with rgb ,  and one with dvi only . 
at least on the abc setting ,  it says each of those once . 
i have been a huge fan of altoids for years . 
i wanted a nice looking one in spite of it being used . 
however ,  this pony extension just didn t work for me . 
no eggplant flavor ,  tastes like hummus ,  out of the can . 
in comparison ,  advil does have an effect  generic ibuprofen not as good  . 
my bangle cat lost interest after a day . 
i don t have a lot of time to deal with the return . 
i paid $ for this woven stretch belt . 
i started getting acne during sophomore year of college ,  at num_extend
after several hours of downloading and the installation i booted up the game . 
too inexpensive to send back ,  and not good enough to use . 
i bought a marumi instead and the difference in quality is astounding . 
it hard to enjoy listen to music with one ear when exercise . 
a friend told me about the gel padded types of gloves . 
may not be as foolproof ,  but it feels more like yourself . 
friend told me i had to have these . 
this defeats the purpose of hands free in a car . 
sending it back and going back to a hand towel . 
i ordered size num_num toddler for my daughter . 
next time i d buy them a real one instead . 
there s no tv output on this ,  what a shame num_extend
this ,  and  vocal ease  have the strangest tastes and they burn . 
so i would have to recommend against buying it . 
they re only $ each so we can t be too disappointed . 
i bought this product a few months ago and it s already broken . 
you can t get your hand inside to wash it . 
the taste is sweet sweet sweet and my cinnamon tastes artificial . 
the problem is with the cheap material hb uses to make the beatters . 
its does nothing but an additional piece of insole inside the shoes . 
i don t expect it to last a year . 
heard good things about this product from another woman . 
i don t know what the big deal is with this product . 
maybe some people can buy batteries at this rate ,  but not him . 
the celetron adaptor doesn t accomodate large eypieces very well . 
these look cuter in the photo than they are in reality . 
every time you lift the console it comes off . 
this term was new to me and another surprise . 
my socks are always damp now when i remove my shoes . 
unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset . 
i had to go out and buy a new battery . 
it was bland and i couldn t pick up any  peanut butter  flavor . 
always cuts out and no one can hear me . 
the percolator part just does not live up to expectation . 
saw my doctor and blood work showed elevated liver enzyme . 
the zipper has a flap that goes the wrong direction . 
also when it is finally connect it swipes the opposite way . 
amazon sent me out another one ,  num_num day shipping . 
if you don t press down on it firmly it doesn t work . 
needless to say these have since been returned . 
this product is inexpensive for a reason i guess . 
the only way to really protect any phone is with the otter . 
the boots are very expensive when you consider the quality . 
this is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game . 
i looked around and found the syma chinook helicopter . 
it doesn t charge well and a complete waste of my money . 
the frosting kind of cracks off and there is not much filling . 
there aren t enough bristles and they are too soft to clean effectively . 
i notice that there s no mention of al lowe anywhere from sierra . 
i even advanced my system ,  but it didnt help . 
i would recommend trying their red kidney bean curry  rajma masala  instead . 
or maybe a lawnmower in the dead of winter . 
he loves fire engines just not this one . 
this was the beginning of an expensive nightmare . 
thinking it was just a fluke ,  i exchanged it for another . 
i bought this lens after much research and procrastination ,  it was expensive . 
the questions were really silly ,  for the most part . 
too bad ,  i was hoping this could occupy his teething needs . 
the bottle is pretty small too for the price . 
he says it pulls his hair too much . 
seemed like a good idea and liked it at first . 
the legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline . 
i would not recommend this tube to anyone . 
otherwise works great  :   will make great garage sell item . 
i will try it again and return if i change my mind . 
the other unacceptable flaw was the flimsy mounting system . 
i then tried the  cultured  version which didn t do this  asin num_extend
don t think they ll last more than a couple of washes . 
i am double bagging these till i run out . 
i am just going to use these and not buy this one . 
bought this drive to use on an old system to archive data . 
i think the  peanut  will bridge the gap between usability and reliability . 
i will not buy lodge logic online again . 
it s not even worthy as a kid s toy . 
and i know it s going to get scratched and dirtied easily . 
just smelling it made me want to get sick . 
this sounds like a lot of micromanaging and it is . 
i guess  animal digest  is not one of his favorite ingredients . 
by the time i got the fourth screw in i called it quits . 
my num_extend however ,  is due for a trip back to amazon . 
it also got stuck on the same number and wouldn t move . 
any type of shadow makes it go off . 
lots of static in the background on my end . 
yep ,  it broke in the same exact spot . 
i have thick ,  coarse ,  color treated curly hair . 
the problem though is that all the characters are the same . 
i bought this product in december of num_extend
the seams have a started to come apart . 
and the one with the bandage felt better . 
it looked more like num_num day old hair . 
i m a relatively fit dude but not overly muscular or skinny . 
the nozzle on the bottle clogged one time after use . 
what i do not like about the game is how weak it is . 
this product has not been effective in treating my mild acne . 
i really like now brand ,  but this product is no good . 
it would be cheaper and would work better . 
i didn t feel like it did anything for me . 
these don t fit on a single pair of earring i own . 
save your money when it comes to this one . 
it is still a junk product but it works fairly well as fixed . 
i had to return it for a refund minus the handling fees . 
the fit on this bra was not right for me . 
not a problem :  amazon allowed me to return them . 
she just tips herself right over quite often on a perfectly flat surface . 
i will never buy these again from amazon . 
especially since the errors are of their own making . 
wheels did not spin . cheaply made piece of chinese crap !  . 
but we are englishmen ,  of the finest character . 
after opening mine for the first time it never really closed again . 
it will randomly jump to the top or the bottom . 
although there were a few in there that i couldn t pronounce . 
the foam is not very secure on the end . 
plus ,  the eggplants are not fried that well . 
we had to go outside for it to work . 
by the second stage i quit because it became frustrating . 
my puppy played with for about num_num minutes squeaking it like crazy yesterday . 
when i did get it to pour ,  too much sauce came out . 
i ordered this and a different product arrived instead . 
the patch is supposed to correct some of the more obvious bugs . 
they have sharp edges !  !  !  they chromed rough areas . 
received this today and tried it in my iphone num_extend
i bought this @ walmart when it num_extend came out . 
all num_num turned their noses up on this food . 
not surprising for the price . i put a fresh battery in it . 
mine lasted about num_num weeks of weekend use . 
she has a galaxy num_extend and it struggled to pair with the headset . 
you have to have num_extend of ram to load a picture . 
i dont like it and wish i could return but she scratched it . 
not sure if i will buy this again . 
it does work ,  i ve begun to see results . 
this thing does not stick to the ipod it always keeps falling off . 
think fly paper when you buy this item . 
when i was able to use soundsticks before ,  it was great . 
anything like this is worthless ,  i have found . 
plus ,  it s rather pricey for the amount of product you receive . 
summary :  a lot of the positive reviews are quite old . 
either go to a raw diet or use a premium food . 
it s easier and cheaper than you might think . 
i wouldn y buy again due to the smell and size . 
if the battery worked it would be a winner !  . 
the other problem was the collar would loosen up from daily wear . 
the toe on this one was just too long for me . 
other than that they are great tasting peas . 
now ,  after num_num months ,  it is completely corroted . 
leonard s and they said they would take them back . 
this is just how triethanolamine reacts with acid . 
not worth the hassle of trying to find less expensive plastic rolls . 
he managed to break it after about num_num hours of play . 
the second one ,  a teddy bear ,  wouldn t stop chasing me . 
the num_num mp doesn t give enough picture quality . 
pop tarts also contain gmo sugar and gmo soy . 
if you have long ,  slender fingers ,  give them a try . 
this is one hell of a mediocre game . 
i have a milk allergy that makes my face break out . 
the ear loops are of lightweight plastic and not adjustable at all . 
but in subsequent calls ,  they told me to do it again . 
i used it to try to deodorize my dogs between baths . 
when it was running ,  other applications didn t get a look in . 
my last subscribe and save shipment was $
a few of the reviews were spot on about the major flaws . 
she loves animals so i thought she d really like it . 
i have since purchased a stansport black granite mess kit . 
forget taking a photo while standing behind the camera with the remote . 
my mastiff weighs num_num lbs and the advertising says the ramp will hold num_extend
from the start ,  this machine screamed at me . 
the construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap . 
however ,  it is much worse than the iphone s browser . 
this tie out is not the red color that is pictured . 
too bad ,  this one could have been fun . 
this will affect my shopping at amazon considerably . 
it s hard to go totally wrong with that type of lineage . 
it was not easy to spread and the color was off . 
i was in sea water and these batteries got ruined . 
if the zippers fail ,  this bag will be worthless . 
i don t care about the many useless functions . 
i will post a pic as soon as i get another camera . 
worked fine but would not hold charge but a few hours without use . 
but i still see his sun spots on his face . 
everything in the nutrition label under carbohydrates is sugar . 
what is not okay is the screw that holds both scissor pieces together . 
especially if ,  like me ,  you are sensitive to smells . 
i regret to write that this chain had to be returned . 
i ordered this case well over three weeks ago . 
the pepper overpowered the taste of the cashews . 
not from dirty hands ,  from the material they used . 
it didn t last num_num minutes before my dog chewed it off . 
what i received is cute ,  fur lined ,  well sewn . 
the noise is loud and i repeat ,  very annoying . 
i do love the taste of goats milk . 
i wish this phone was more polished ,  i do . 
i guess i like a little more weight to my undershirts . 
it suppose to be able to shoot single or double action . 
if your beard is slightly growing in ,  forget it . 
our num_num pound lab demolishes the similar but smaller orange bone chews . 
window does not properly line up with screen . 
i guess this product doesn t work on some people . 
luckily we were able to ship it back . 
i bought this for my num_num year old son . 
okay ,  so i was excited to get this . 
suncast products took a big turn for the worse with this product . 
after a few uses i became disappointed with the results . 
just a bit of alcohol and average scent . 
given that ,  i had to return the watch . 
the cables are too thick ,  bulky and stiff . 
get better fitting shoes since these will not hold loose straps up . 
most of the time it never worked properly . 
worse ,  there s very little difference between the various fighters . 
the suction was weak to begin with and got worse over time . 
they just twist all around making it unusable . 
i bought mine at a local micro center . 
it kind of kills the fun by level num_extend
i was hopeful this product would help me insert soft contact lenses . 
i used this packet in unsweetened iced tea . 
the medium version of this shirt could maybe fit an num_num year old .

this will make the rainbow six friends very disappointed . 
i bought one of these at a   .  .  .   . 
yes it is dependable whining away without fail . 
and then oh no ,  it does not work . 
might as well go back to the wired mouse and keyboard . 
run your hand across the board and it is a bumpy mess . 
it was over all cheaply made and presented . 
this sight appears to be built very well and made from good materials . 
i tried it with all of my chargers . 
it does play ok over the internet though . 
initially this smelled good ,  when i dabbed a bit on my wrist . 
i winded the crank and out rolled away on the counter an .

after about num_num month of usage ,  it is broken today . 
it seemed to work fine in the usb num_extend port . 
it tripped every time i let the handle go .

but here s the low down if you re an analytical thinker . 
what fun is that ?  i d give it a zero . 
the session always failed regardless of the fax recipient . 
good introduction to digital photographer for younger folk . 
unfortunately ,  neither of our kittens has had any interest in them . 
what s the need to have them run so large ?  disappointed . 
they are a very tight fit to get it onto the iphone . 
but i will be purchasing a replacement from another manufacturer . 
it is not at all intuitive and the graphics are horrible . 
really really bad design . i really wanted to like this game . 
great idea if it would fit tighter and was constructed better . 
so when you order make sure you are getting the right size . 
i am num_extend and num_num lbs and it looked ridiculous .

my cat is okay ,  i digged through his poop to find it . 
i received this game on friday the num_extend of march . 
the sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray . 
i think liner is the wrong name for this product .

from very expensive electrostatic units to cheapy sony ear buds for my walkman . 
the most attractive thing is how narrow it is . 
i have almost two tones dark skin around my mouth .

i guess i will stick to buying what i generally buy at safeway . 
the other still works ,  but im not thrilled . 
these boots fits very snugly around the calf . 
the mechanical weapons are boring ,  the biological ones more interesting . 
i read the reviews and watched the youtube reviews . 
a lot of money for such a poor fit . 
the construction is nowhere near the quality of the old version . 
it s slightly less and the quality seems even better . 
the nook looks so cool ,  until you own one . 
i would not recommend this mask to anyone . 
frustrating to say the least but they still are functional . 
older babies ,  or developmentally advanced ones  ,  the product should be fine .

i never got more than two devices to work simultaneously with this router . 
i routinely have to force close verizon s backup num_extend
the outfits would fit an infant or baby doll . 
we would reattach per instructions and have two green indicatorrs . 
it is loud !  it was fun ,  at first . 
unfortunately ,  the readings are consistently difficult to read . 
was not able to use the adapter sucessfully . 
num_num stars because the wireless and optical part works fine . 
after three tries i struck out with this item . 
i will be filing a claim with amazon . com .

in that case ,  this unit fits the bill . 
i then tried scaraway silicone sheets which helped tremendously with my scar . 
now i have to package up this mess to be returned .

i own num_num camera backpacks a tamrac adventure num_num and this one .

i thought since dw bradley wrote it ,  it would be turn based . 
i bought this carrier for my tiny maltese puppy . 
this only works if i use it while things are still  fresh  . 
but so far as i can see ,  they have not . 
the epic feels like the same plastic as a pop bottle ,  literally . 
it doesn t matter how great they sound if you re getting headaches . 
it wasn t just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . 
it did not help me with freeze ,  dryness or anything .

this was a great pan and one that we used everyday . 
what little i was able to use of it ,  it seemed fine . 
i purchased this phone but turned out defective . 
we use these in salads or we mix in mayo for shrimp sandwich .

tried reinstalling drivers ,  and on different pcs ,  but it s dead . 
my hair slid out of the roller before i could secure num_extend
i add pumpkin pie spice to the coffee grounds before brewing . 
the game is a disappointment to say the least . 
if we lived in a milder climate they would have been perfect . 
i want to make sure i express how horrible they were . 
i have been buying these and loving them for a long time . 
i would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange . 
kind of a rip off unless you have lots of free time . 
i thought i had found the ideal solution . 
not impressed with these ,  wish i had not ordered them . 
it just doesn t work like it s supposed to . 
it isn t the brand ,  it s something about this particular shoe . 
it comes in around the toes ,  not over the top . 
he said it was too difficult to aim with the spring action . 
it is very difficult to lock and to unlock . 
i got num_num hours of standby tops without putting it in airplane mode . 
spent about num_num weeks upgrading drivers ,  playing the game for a bit . 
it was not worth my time and money to return it . 
there are literally hundreds of errors in this game . 
if you are wanting a refreshing drink ,  do not get this . 
so ,  it might not make sense to purchase it anyway . 
so tight that i initially thought they had sent me the wrong armband . 
it does not fit on the iphone num_extend
this is a disposable bike ,  and a $ disposable bike at that . 
it has an overly sweet ,  artificial taste to it . 
i would recommend spending the extra $ to buy the jabra freeware . 
well the product said it takes num_num weeks to see results . 
after reading all the positive reviews i was so hopeful . 
it s a filler and somehow associated  at times  with vitamin b . 
for this reason it simply does not react well with most num_extend polishes . 
as of this date i have not been able to make a repair . 
the purple one pops up when she barely slides the switch . 
buy a leapster or an apple product instead . 
i ordered two  at separate times  and they both were damaged or defective . 
final fantasy doesn t make you buy items from a save point . 
i was not happy with the results at all . 
well you really get what you pay for . 
i also emailed kuhn rikon ,  but no response . 
it s a nasty habit for a robot to get into . 
i bought my first smoothie pro at the end of october . 
i am disappointed and feet are still cold . 
might work best for people with back yards dealing with dry poop . 
it s just the graphic itself that i m not thrilled about . 
either way ,  this desert essence deodorant is getting returned . 
there was absolutely no positive difference from using the product . 
the batteries that came with it wouldnt even fit in the charger . 
it simply couldn t pull up one of the fish . 
i may end up going back to them . 
ea should stick to the generic bond face like in this one . 
this is one of those products that it depends on who you ask . 
please consider yourself warned before buying this game . 
kid loved it but .  .  . scope quality isn t the problem . 
we did extensive research on ramps for our num_num year old doberman . 
i guess i would call turkey a ripoff . 
it has a bitter taste that nunaturals didn t have . 
when i first got them they were very comfortable and i was satisfied . 
maybe i will if i end up playing a lot with my friends . 
these noodles have the weirdest texture ,  flavor and they stink like fish . 
i m thinking about gluing the thing together and then trying it . 
this is not black with an auburn color to it . 
not to mention the prices is much better . 
you re paying $ basically ,  for a piece of paper . 
save your money and do not buy this flat iron . 
where netgear saw num_num networks this carrd saw zero . 
purchased to hold my iphone num_extend to dash of my new num_num passat . 
but the game could have used much more tech support before release . 
yeah sure ,  that sounds like fun as well . 
thinking maybe it will increase the signal but i was wrong . 
please avoid unless you want a disappointed child . 
i only bought these to use while running . 
we have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly . 
tends to push it forward and out or let it be wobbly . 
i never got a call back . i returned the router . 
fast forwarding num_num weeks since ,  and it has num_num visible white scratches . 
although it clumps well , my cat objected to the smell . 
taking it off feels like breaking the case . 
i sent this one back right away ,  hated too ,  but did . 
i suggest looking elsewhere for a natural body lotion . 
each time ,  it just does not work well on my lashes . 
the cover is attractive as the pictures indicate . 
very poor design and fit around the cup . 
instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom . 
the buttons were awkward and hard to use . 
though it wasn t  great  it at least felt like a batman game . 
i think it does work for some people . 
a very nice lady at amazon gave me a refund . 
i also purchased the corresponding conditioner which was equally useless . 
just stick with regular pictionary and you will be alot happier . 
the good points are the good graphics of the soldiers however . 
shame on black ops and ea sports for releasing this disgrace . 
i wouldn t recommend unless it is for a child . 
they make an interior fence system that works with sportdog fence collars . 
this game was an amazing game until xbox num_num got dr . 
i had sent the original and i no longer have it to resend . 
i will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow . 
after some online research i learned its just regular coconut oil . 
save your money and get a different brand . 
this game has some pretty lackluster graphics even for num_extend standards . 
useless piece of device for a device that already has a mic . 
i think either one would work for most feet . 
but i m returning it because of the odd photo coloration . 
this knife is over sized and makes cutting difficult . 
i use frisbees to play with my dogs . 
i ll be surprised if this one lasts a year . 
while i open the package ,  it is not what i like . 
possibly the worst multiplayer of any game ever . 
in fact i think it made my hair dryer . 
the lyrics on this thing are really embarassing and cheesey . 
i should have realized that sugar free means artificial sweeteners . 
a disappointing item from a usually fantastic melissa and doug product line . 
my husband and i ran to see what was going on . 
this coffee isn t bad ,  its just not one of my favorites . 
shampoo makes hair puffy and frizzy and spray irritates the skin . 
all in all not a well designed toy . 
last night i had a major problem with it . 
why ?  it feels chaulky during application and makes me look washed out . 
i can not stand the ,  this is not jerky at all . 
the problem comes in with trying to save . 
that makes the keyboard completely useless on the iphone num_extend with num_extend
from our experience cameras take a beating and continue to work . 
save your money and look for other product . 
it was a big chunk just the right size for choking . 
how much actual meat is in these treats appears to be negligible . 
it has a very odd artificial flavor and overpowering . 
this is not what i expected from this manufacturer . 
it just made my dark circles look dry and ashy . 
sorry that i ve had to donate this product . 
one little piece of packing tape held the top in place . 
this was listed under the made in usa section . 
i am constantly cleaning crumbs off my counter . 
i owned this camera for less than num_num hours . 
this kind of defeats the purpose of a food processor in my book . 
way too salty ,  with num_extend of sodium in a single num_num oz . 
it stopped working after about num_num months though . 
wouldn t even bother to buy if i knew . 
so i m out of luck until i find another one . 
strongly recommend buying about two sizes bigger than waist size . 
i think this product should be pulled from amazon . 
the paper plate of the cone wrench world . 
took it off to remove it ,  and it was impossible . 
starforce can cause your computer to mess up and also . 
good thing seller gave me a refund thou . 
i agree with most of the other people that posted . 
the markers are terrible ,  like they don t come with enough ink . 
i consider this product to be a conditioner . 
i then spent all night on the web searching for some help . 
i applied coat after coat ,  and still it looked like nothing . 
the last order i received ,  in each of the three bags . 
it became a flat duck in a matter of minutes . 
i had one just like this before and i jus loved it . 
well ,  the top did not come off so i looked for instructions . 
try it if you want ,  but pay attention to the side effects . 
all mobile phones tend to be treated pretty roughly . 
the scent is perfumey strong ,  and not all that pleasant . 
i ordered this product which came in pieces . 
for features that should always be in place . 
i just didn t like the control at all . 
the point of a screen protector is protection . 
i don t plan to buy this ever again . 
drop few more bucks and get something else !  . 
the brush itself is very stiff ,  even after soaking . 
even of its not baseball ,  the graphics are inacceptable . 
there is no flash ,  so that accounts for the darkness . 
i like kernel seasons and many of their flavors . 
but unfortunately ,  the gel wont cure n it stays in liquid . 
we said it before ,  and we ll say it again . 
if only this problem could be fixed ,  i would keep ordering . 
just holding that one in the hand shows a much higher build quality . 
games started locking up left and right after i started using it . 
my favorite murad cleanser is still the vitamin c one . 
wish i would ve reviewed this item before purchase . 
i ended up with buying  moshi screen protector  for my iphone num_extend
i took it off after a couple of trys . 
i compared the original and this one ,  it s % fake . 
she thinks its a toy or some kind of game . 
hardware  ,  the cams are third class quality and so is the support . 
that one is great for thick hair like mine !  . 
they are a bit smaller then i would like . 
it has black rubber ends and in the middle . 
i also have a tarsal tunnel because of the two above . 
why though ?  the first controller does everything besides one thing . 
it shouldn t have even scratched the case or band . 
after three days of using one ,  the microphone snapped off . 
i bought this for my daughter when she was around num_num months . 
boiling water is a simple ,  every day task . 
buttons fall off ,  the plastic is cheap and poorly constructed . 
the stitching was coming apart and he was missing limbs by new year . 
there are only num_num different levels and num_num different characters . 
the quality is fine ,  but the functionality leaves something to be desired . 
you will save yourself a lot of trouble . 
you may reap big dollars while helping us to vent some anger . 
the delay was long enough for me to miss many great shots . 
the first time i used it the battery cover popped off . 
so i purchased it and it smells very musty and thick . 
not likely to sell into any business that has num_extend only . 
the taste is okay but a bit bland . 
i only had about num_num pictures that were just about ok . 
the rubber also becomes lose and doesn t hold its original form . 
i would never recommend this product to anyone ,  not even a cat . 
i can not believe i fell for this . 
i have been using this color num_extend deep copper  for a while . 
his mom decided to let him keep it anyway . 
i don t know if it s going out of business or what . 
we will get back to you within num_num days . 
this city is designed to be seen from a distance . 
i have yet to be able to get the picture of this thing . 
do not spend a penny on this toy . 
first of all this system has terrible graphics . 
does not have any style after initial wear . 
now that i m num_num it s just a bunk cheap release . 
the space bar does not work when hit on the right side . 
i received it on time ,  but it didn t work . 
i am so glad i didn t pay $ for it . 
cheaply made ,  not much weight to it at all . 
i had already paid shipping and now another num_extend to return it . 
i sure wasted my money on this piece of junk !  . 
if the cats had used it once ,  it would have fallen off . 
they do not last through even one batch of cookies . 
i did so much research into what i could do to combat this . 
i opened the box for mine and immediately it smelled like burnt wires . 
i ll post two photos to show what happened . 
you don t even fight you don t controll the pikmin . 
it starts with zooming around trying to save metropolis from a meteor storm . 
okay ,  i will deal with the lag ,  maybe tamron is busy . 
you play as a group of youths fighting for a rebel resistance movement . 
that is the best way to cheapen any chocolate item you are creating . 
as others have noted ,  nearly all the cans were significantly dented . 
it is a seamless transition but they left out that one important factor . 
i have to agree with the one review . 
my girls really wanted this toy and received it as a holiday gift . 
i receive ,  and make ,  a lot of technical support calls . 
coffee in the past has been a good value . 
reviews talk about wearing these for hours on end . 
this didn t really seem to help very much . 
purchased this toy for my daughter last christmas . 
the coconut milk has a strange smell and flavor . 
it was a huge pain !  i would not recommend it . 
frankly ,  this looks ,  feels ,  and functions like a cheap knockoff . 
i emptied the mag ,  tried again ,  and had the same results . 
it s rather large compared to most stuffed toys the cats have . 
i got her another one and resolved not to play as rough . 
but gave it to a friend with smaller phone . 
it had a vent in the back to channel air out . 
i used this in yellow stone wyoming with no issues . 
i consider that old version  ff iii  more fun to play than this . 
these bb products are way overpriced for the quality . 
we ve lost countless hours of work due to this coir . 
that s when i switched to organic shampoos and conditioners . 
i think this might be for an air soft pistol . 
it was everywhere on my clothes in the dryer . 
the metal is very heavy grade so it took some work to bend . 
my children opened their new leapsters with delight on christmas morning . 
i ordered this based on many of the reviews . 
currently in my box of  miscellaneous junk stuff  . 
now ,  the basket style filter as opposed to the conestyle filter . 
my biggest complaint ,  though ,  is of the mess that it makes . 
unfortunately ,  i am on the negative side and will be returning this . 
i will gladly pass this expensive jar of honey on to her . 
within a week ,  it looks like i never bothered . 
there should be a warning or claim about that somewhere . 
i tryed the micro crystals for s short time . 
the cable ,  however ,  was wrapped as if new . 
there is a giant bee and the flowers look computer animated . 
i have tried to put this product on my phone several times . 
looks like i wasted my money on this . 
so ,  i was looking forward to trying this . 
but i look at it as a investment for my feet . 
i m out $ and am now researching the other one cup machines . 
however at this point and time ,  mario is definitly showing his age . 
what wasn t minor was the terribly offensive odor in this third bottle . 
it does not work in uk safety sockets . 
num_num hours into this mess and i have lost num_num cardinal tetras . 
i have other galaxy siii cases but did want a purple one . 
buying online and return is a pain now . 
i have thick ,  wavy hair and this stuff sucks . 
but if num_num bottles don t help ,  we re done . 
i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic . 
i can only use them on shoes that are quite big . 
plus this vignetting is not a pleasing vignette . 
looks like a stretch tube with a slit . 
i checked three different sites to check on how much potassium they contained . 
i suppose for us ,  that remains to be seen . 
my emperor num_extend filter pad looks disgusting after a month . 
the shiny handle material on mine was all scratched . 
i do not know why anyone would give this a rave review . 
this review is for the chocolate fudge flavor of the think thin bars . 
we have standard silverware and they just fell over in the compartments . 
i can see why this model is no longer available . 
presenta una muy buena imagen y una nitidez y fidelidad normales . 
he rated it num_extend and i would rate it num_extend
my kid will hardly touch them ,  and i can t blame him . 
reminds me of our fussy touch screen fax machine at work . 
maybe i ll wait another month before trying it again . 
i would rather pay more money and get better quality . 
i will keep it as a nice cover . 
i ll repeat that since it is very important and ridiculous . 
not only that ,  but the batteries die out quickly . 
frankly ,  likes his clifford the big red dog regular books much better . 
maybe you saw the original version of this review . 
does not actually prevent ,  or even seem to inhibit ,  lifting . 
when i was given one of these cards i was really happy . 
the grinds stay put ,  without being bothered by static electricity . 
also ,  the red paint has flasked off all over it . 
my experience with this product was very disappointing . 
the smell ran us out of the house . 
i have tried their hazelnut flavor and liked it well enough . 
it s a great idea but not well executed . 
the snaps on the side wouldn t stay snapped shut . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
that makes it hard to apply much force . 
i went back to the swim diapers and ditched these . 
fruit of the loom stopped using tags about a year ago now . 
i tried this product last year ,  with high hopes . 
on average you get num_extend  copper  per quest completed . 
so in that regard ,  i can t technically find it at fault . 
it looked awesome and had a nice feel to it . 
it s not organic ,  but at least you can drink it . 
and they don t need to shove their product down your throat . 
i have seen kids toys built num_num times better than this . 
not that great of a product but great customer service . 
thq really needs to recall this product and finish the game . 
my dogs do not like the minty taste . 
he started swallowing the hair !  i find this toy to be dangerous . 
at least not in the way that i expected . 
this product lets in a lot of dust and then traps it . 
this looks to be a lot safer than the box kind . 
otterbox replaced the case because they figured it was defective . 
just hope that they had better luck with it than i did . 
it did not hold in the liquid at all . 
he is a kitten and everything that moves is fun to him . 
they don t last long before they come apart . 
this one is the poorest quality of the bunch . 
it is especially difficult if you have arthritis . 
i bought an num_extend because i wear a num_extend shoe . 
the belt is pretty wonky from being rubber and being folded during shipping . 
i bought this unit to replace num_num sony num_num cd only disc players . 
i had purchased the same opener several years ago at a department store . 
i have used other krud kutter products that are outstanding . 
how can it be rated low ?  the bristles are way too sharp . 
this is supposed to have a one year warranty . 
this was a very pricey item that was a poor fit . 
this is by far the worst game i have ever played . 
measuring that would probably require some very sophisticated technology . 
i was using them around my farm ,  so basic use . 
the bottle could not have been full when i got it . 
i m still uncomfortable ,  and now my coworkers are as well . 
it was wonderful for paella ,  omeletes ,  sauces ,  etc . 
ok ,  how many people know the difference ?  i do now . 
what about the actual gameplay ? this game is very linear . 
tech support said i had an old driver . 
here s the caviat ,  enemies don t always drop loot . 
i bought this at the same time i bought the loreal perfecting base . 
i will not repurchase ,  such a waste of $
this did not work for us at all . 
my son received this as a gift ,  and loved it at first . 
i d return this but that would seem really gross and weird . 
most of the time the mouth doesn t even open . 
spend a few bucks more and get something of higher quality . 
the timer and light worked ,  but the plates did not heat up . 
leave it on jsut to test it and not another problem . 
i bought this gun for my little brother . 
i now just use my phones without the screen protectors . 
i thought i had a much better steamvac in the hoover . 
after it s washed it will be good for nothing . 
sodium ,  in its natural state ,  is extremely volatile . 
then i read that you should take specific acidophilus for your particular ailment . 
putting something heavy on the rack causes it to sag in the middle . 
holds a lot of dvds but the materials are flimsy . 
you wouldn t want to do it all in one sitting . 
it was less than a week later that is quit working permanently . 
not a product for the weak of stomach . 
it requires constant reapplication which defeats the purpose of it . 
actually ,  it felt like it was too rough on my gums . 
there s no need for cleaning solution after every use . 
velco and glue doesn t keep it in place . 
when i opened the bottle ,  i got an unpleasant surprise . 
when it worked ,  it was fantastic and stylish . 
after is it running you then feel this chill come over you . 
the unfortunate news is the included foil is not compatible . 
i would never leave it mounted it slops all over the place . 
unfortunately ,  it made my hair feel very dry even with the conditioner . 
as you might expect ,  sand doesn t clump terrifically . 
i d be afraid to put anything warm inside it . 
maybe this product is terrific at what it does ,  once configured . 
my biggest peeve about this game is the lack of save points . 
the fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow . 
i d give it one star ,  but i like the initial texture . 
you need a good extender for this to work . 
if i still had the box and receipt ,  i d return it . 
i played probably num_num games and gave up . 
i have the nalgene as well that works great . 
at first i was very excited about this game . 
the rubber piece rippe the same day i try to put it on . 
when it is good it is beyond num_num stars . 
i felt great at the next day but my face had some acne . 
be a man and buy the gransfor bruks scandinavian forest axe . 
i felt like a little kid in a hospital again . 
there was glass num_num feet away from the stove . 
this toy in no way stands up to powerful chewers . 
i use half the package of cheese powder . 
its an ok color but not something i ll be going to . 
i found these tires to be a constant frustration . 
nice finish but i need a battery not something that looks pretty . 
only reason i d give them num_num star is for the graphics . 
i thought would look cute over a french nail . 
bleah ,  we sent the vcr back to amazon . 
remember they are plastic and given the pricing one should not expect more . 
wonderful pistachios used to be my favorite brand . 
also ,  one of the bunion pieces is missing . 
i plan to discard this unit and buy a sangean . 
i couldn t get the medium over my thighs !  order large . 
i d figure i d lose half the cost of the item . 
good old gravity siphoning works about num_num times faster than this pump . 
it is still very strong and spicey and to much for me . 
i had assumed everything made by ranch rewards was made in the usa . 
i bought these for a  treasure chest  for my kid s school . 
it dried my skin ,  has a strong fragrance . 
i am being generous in giving num_num stars . 
compatible with my son s nokia ,  and my husband s samsung . 
if i could return this contraption i would . 
not sure why ,  maybe lots of new ingredients ,  some artificial . 
bravo to amazon for standing behind their products . 
this game is like a bastarized verision of a once proud series . 
when i tried to detatch and change the oriantation . 
i have purchased several varieties of cesar canine cuisine . 
overall the quality isn t as great as my first one . 
price was attractive but very poor quality construction material . 
there are better foods at this price point . 
but the flow of water from it is very slow . 
it looks like it would work great for someone with a small head . 
these people need to buy a tape measure . 
i have to put it in the roof of the mouth . 
i have always loved oxo products for their innovative and ergonomic design . 
a dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all . 
get a tipman num_extend or something like that . 
cook some basmati rice and you have a meal for two . 
even better ,  the beautifully matte is much more affordable . 
it boils water quickly plus the num_num oz . 
i should have just bought one at joaann s . 
the power light would turn red immediately after a long charge . 
this food was sent to me in error by cat food direct . 
perhaps the blueberry brown sugar or raspberry chocolate varieties are better options . 
for full disclosure s sake ,  i did not drink the entire mixture . 
even as an adult i couldn t make the drum respond every time . 
i went the cheap route and bought the back to basics peeler . 
i saw this and decided it was time start it up again . 
i found this product dull and left my hair limp . 
it helps some ,  but will not really solve the problem . 
maybe i ll hit the lotto and afford laser therapy . 
wow ea really tricked me into buying this pathetic excuse for a game . 
i purchased this product ,  but was concerned about all the negative reviews . 
this case feels cheap and like something will break off of it anytime . 
it is small and did not filter well . 
in short ,  the whole production simply feels glitchy and incomplete . 
loaded it up with num_extend of gear and went hiking with it . 
it was the first of its kind ,  or one of the first . 
but it s so heavy ,  it really isn t practical . 
after heating the soup ,  the base was still very oily . 
i purchase these after reading so many good reviews . 
once i removed the cream the itching stopped . 
sort of watery and hard to rinse out . 
i use to shave against the grain my cheeks and under my jawline . 
they screw on top and are real crooked . 
we walk over to check it and it goes off and sprays us . 
i put the strips on the recliner last night . 
these are smallish but definitely not pocketable in a shirt . 
halo for pc is not only outdated ,  but not very fun . 
the are itchy and baggy they look nothing like the photo shows . 
this is the second  bottle  of olay regenerist eye serum . 
i bought the recommended size and they don t fit . 
it s been several months ,  and it hasn t come back . 
if you play with you team past num_num to num_num etc . 
these are made in china and quality fits the stereotypes . 
it s a very generic case that does the job :  nothing fancy . 
at least it wasn t pricey and is a good moisturizer . 
from point blank range num_extend feet  it does not hit the target . 
they sent me a new one ,  i was excited . 
had to buy grout paint and redo grouting but it now looks great . 
maybe i just have a lazy cat but he did not like this . 
it was nowhere near as pretty as in the picture . 
how do i know this ?  on installation the metal warped . 
around star num_num i lost my interest in continuing . 
i couldn t stand to be in the room with it on . 
however ,  i just couldn t get them to stay on the screen . 
plus the necklace was on the tighter side . 
it s faint and i cant smell it after i apply on . 
it is very light and not very loud . 
it might work fine for other pets so your mileage may vary . 
i cut myself a couple of times and threw it out . 
i spent half an hour getting them out and then detangling it afterwards . 
too bad as the price is so low it does not warrant returns . 
i received a return label in februay num_extend
first rechargeable batteries that i have ever had a problem with . 
i have to take it apart daily to clean it . 
everything just looks grey and dirty and it s absolutely hideous . 
and ripped on pieces  ,  don t wasted on this product . 
don t buy them if you want a quality product . 
i tried to polish them but nothing worked  ,  they are just dull . 
i am much happier with the cardo scala num_num bluetooth headset . 
after a few weeks the whole thing quite working . 
the hinge also broke on mine after a very short time . 
all in all ,  a very poor product that has disappointed me . 
but when you get down to it ,  this game is just boring . 
to return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worth . 
perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours . 
check out the yamahas before you make a final decision . 
works fine on windows xp ,  but does not work well with linux . 
slipped num_extend into case ,  very easy ,  but some issues jump out . 
this experience will deter me from buying bose products in the future . 
really my hair seems indifferent to the stuff . 
this seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on amazon . 
all the other ones broke eventually but its pretty silly to come broken . 
if not i am sending this unit back and requesting my money back . 
the water level is on the back side . 
so ,  sadly ,  i won t be keeping these  :   . 
it did not look like new per the reviews of previous users . 
and that s a shame because i loved the mink colored suede . 
both you and your pup will be pleased with it . 
a subpar product but you get what you pay for . 
you get a nice little assortment of extras in the box . 
i would give this really a num_extend star ,  but i was generous . 
its like cold cream .  . same texture as noxema original . 
when i called this company no one ever answers the phone . 
i did not follow everyone else advice and went ahead and bought it . 
poor product ,  poor description ,  and poor customer service from niagara cycle . 
this cable will not give you hd i . e . 
i honestly used this once and it went right into the trash . 
i should have listened to all the other reviews . 
real disappointed with this entire line of skin care . 
ucreate has been a disappointment over and over again for us . 
it is an hp pavillion num_extend with dual dvd drives . 
save your money and just get rechargeable aa batteries . 
there s no way i could replace sugar with this stuff . 
i have to agree with the latter grouping . 
this cologne is so bad ,  it smells like dirty bo . 
it is convoluted instead of a real circle . 
i bought the num_num pack because of the raving reviews here . 
this one has a slightly thicker corkscrew so it breaks the corks . 
there are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against . 
show me a decent springboard module you can plug into this . 
they are okay if they are placed on top of a cutting board . 
i ve had this for a little over num_num years . 
i bought the num_num cm ball because i am relatively tall . 
we paused our  intimate moment  to go rinse everything off . 
well ,  as far as i can tell there is none . 
i used the spray also and found it not to help . 
broke super fast stupid and not worth the money . 
i called sennheiser and they do not carry internal parts . 
i then sent two emails ,  neither of which have been answered . 
they are just like any other brand you chose . 
this made a huge difference to the efficacy of the product . 
guess those great lands end shirts have him spoiled :   . 
most of the time there is a save point just around the corner . 
i think they re better than num_num star ,  but not much . 
then she also does that dog thing where she leave a little trail . 
i returned the entire product ,  stopped membership and was returned all costs . 
i emailed the manufacturer and they did not respond . 
you first must attach a small device to your phone . 
look for a better product and save yourself the aggrivation . 
this game has no replay value at all . 
red num_num and yellow num_num may cause hyperactivity in children . 
on older skin it sits on the surface and makes it look dry . 
this i think is one size fits all ,  adult as well . 
she loves these so i ordered two big bags . 
too bad it has absolutly nothing to do with the movie . 
until that happens ,  i can not recommend them to anyone . 
it connected to my pc like a normal one would . 
works great for a while but then has tendency to start slowing down . 
the amazon page says to buy a size below your normal size . 
this product is good ,  smells like tea very strong . 
but they are unbearably tight in the crotch . 
not impressed ,  did not last for more than a week . 
bodyglove may be irrelevant in the smartphone generation . 
i am num_num years old and perhaps the others are alot younger . 
i really don t like them because they are bulky and heavy . 
the sims num_num is the best horrible game of all time . 
i am a lover of all things lemon . 
because that is what you will be doing with this toy . 
no num_extend error or  no disk  .  .  . just turns off . 
the luscious orange flavor was only hinted at . 
this is a bad product that should be taken off the market . 
may try to get rid of them on ebay one day soon . 
perfect ! when i actually started eating them ,  i was really disappointed . 
i chose to return these and look into other solutions . 
i just got the garmin forerunner num_num about a week ago . 
i love chocolate and have had some of the best . 
again ,  consult your local county extension office or the usda website . 
these things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small . 
everyone should drink more water ,  or so we are told . 
had to throw it out and buy a bigger more expensive pool . 
i m a gourmet cook and use the pressure cooker a lot . 
someday i might need to have my information portable . 
i was surprised how cheaply made this is . 
even more painful is reviewing and deleting pictures . 
she has a large black kong that seems to work so far . 
it shuts off while still full of water . 
this waffle iron worked great until we tried to clean it . 
well when i put it on ,  the color was a bit weird . 
how many poles do you find that size ?  pretty much zero . 
the raspberry pi went into a reboot loop with this power supply connected . 
spring for a little more in a better quality product . 
cod : uo might be short but atleast it was thrilling . 
review dropped to one star ,  blades tossed in the trash . 
amazon was great and took it with my description of the problems . 
this game is the same like the first one for xbox . 
nba live is just teh same as it was num_num years ago . 
paid a little more and got one with accessories . 
all of the legs were off and the stuffing was pulled out . 
unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews . 
i am num_extend with an hourglass figure at num_num lbs . 
my carrier also checked the battery performance and found it was not good . 
it had no branding on it and shipped in a clear plastic bag . 
not what i need from a bra at all . 
this product simply gives you lots of empty calories which adds weight . 
it comes out way too thick and the scent is heavily perfumed . 
and then you start another level ,  another eternity of a delay . 
after that they had n tee at in this piece . 
  except hit and run and road rage . 
this means it is not compatible with other iphone camera apps or functions . 
my own experience with this router was not good . 
i am enraged right now at this godforsaken pos laptop  lock  . 
i would not pay full price for this . 
this is a complaint i don t often make ,  num_extend
have to really bend and twist them to reach certain angles . 
it is as difficult to put on as it is to take off . 
the width band is almost two inches smaller than what it actually says . 
my personal opinion is that this it s not good at all . 
this is one of the most beautiful iphone cases . 
it claims to also fit ruger num_extend but it did not . 
i  itched  it through the cap ,  but it hurt worse and worse . 
however ,  it has already cracked and it leaks onto my porch . 
people that love this game seem to love it for the theme . 
i bought this based on all the glorious reviews on this product . 
it did do a good job of cleaning the carpet . 
recognizing your favorite players are not a problem . 
i expected something a little more imaginative instead i receive an . 
i would recommend using the similarly sized havahart num_num instead . 
the screen is excellent ,  and it is thin and light . 
alba definitely should seek out gentler surfactants for facial use . 
i went to charge my ipod when the battery . 
i loved the cut scenes and the graphics . 
i would not recommend this toy at all . 
it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes . 
really ?  we teach our children not to tattletale . 
i ll start by saying what most people already know . 
love those as they protect the whole scope ,  not just the optics . 
one day it simply stopped working without warning . 
needless to say ,  i returned it within num_num mins . 
broke on my first try when used on my wasr . 
money part needs length to really pack some cash in . 
the cord is way too long for my liking . 
i think you ll have better results with the num_extend and num_extend
a sturdy and compact toothbrush that is reasonably priced . 
well the iphone came and i had to restore it . 
the original ship date was june num_extend num_extend
the plastic can t withstand the vibrations of the road . 
this was a completed disappointment and i have num_num boxes to go . 
it rusted !  this is an umbrella !  my $ umbrellas faired better . 
i downloaded the num_extend patch ,  but it wouldn t install . 
your better off with a logitech  ,  or anything but this . 
this is a serious flaw that makes the case quite frustrating . 
i would not purchase again and have not ordered any refills . 
i am not impressed with the results from taking this . 
it s nothing like the videos and image samples they provide . 
avp gold has a limited number of saves depending on the difficulty . 
it is  okay .   just do not get your hopes up . 
if it really works i could care less about what it smells like . 
first time i tried it it said accessory not optimized for iphone . 
i expected the cleansing cloths to have more texture . 
i then hung up and tried to get help thru the  sales  extension . 
it was making a loud sound and not emitting any fog . 
it s a pity there is no warranty . i m very dissapointed . 
i bought these sony mdr num_extend about num_num months ago . 
i have to admit i only used this once . 
apparently ,  water does a very good job with cleaning tear stains . 
that s all i have to say about it . 
its battery cannot be replace what so ever . 
i purchased this game and had multiple issues related to the driver . 
i ve sent them back and will not be reordering them . 
even that was fluke and not as a result of following instructions . 
say what you want ,   black arrow  isn t that great to me . 
for the first num_num days it made me feel very tired . 
no tutorial ,  datalog or even an adequate description in the manual . 
meanwhile ,  nazis are coming out of the woodwork . 
too bad ,  the other fiskar products we have are great . 
my skin isn t fair ,  but it definitely on the light side . 
good product but will not connect with canon num_extend
one thing i had a problem with s vs . 
this will allow rain water and splashing to flood the box . 
i had to sand the bottom until it would fit . 
i brewed it weak and strong and prefered it on the weak side . 
not creamy in texture ,  but still a nice frozen treat . 
i ve got one at work and my wife is using the other . 
it isn t even as long as the original . 
i have isolated the problem to the epson printer driver used . 
when corn worms bite into it ,  their stomachs explode . 
just got it so can t say how well it actually works . 
i am a hunt and peck not a real typer anymore . 
the game went backwards for improvment except graphics . 
i am not associated with yhm in any way . 
he was pulling a goldilocks and num_num bear thing . 
however ,  i have crimson trace laser grips on the pistol . 
i think they are more for an ipad . 
i ve owned this headset for about two hours . 
this unit also sells at the apex num_extend same unit different number . 
using less resulted in a watery drink without much flavor . 
another neutrogena product that amazon is not carrying . 
it made me feel lightheaded ,  so had to stop taking it . 
and most of them tell you useless crap . 
then i can be placed on the list for a replacement . 
either too bland ,  too sweet ,  too just plain gross . 
good graphics but the people are small and very hard to see . 
i run over and over the same area and no hair comes off . 
we used to have a hooded litter box . 
do yourself a favor and pass on this . 
they have idoits with no training answering the phones . 
it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . 
loved the color but it did not last more than an hour . 
there isn t any  this was very disappointing to me  . 
sometimes he reverses his numbers and letters ,  but not a lot . 
i reconnect it and it shows now that is has one power light . 
the overall construction and design of the mask isn t all that great . 
the board requires a little bit of assembly  nothing complicated  . 
it is not a clasp that grips closed on the fabric . 
enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha . 
honestly ,  i wouldn t even use this in a pool . 
i double checked the connection and everything is set up per the instructions . 
this is a really nice case for the galaxy . 
it s very very sticky and it doesn t absorb either . 
i wish nature s way would put it back the way it was . 
it is a modern manufactured window unit widely used in the building industry . 
it left funky looking grease stains on my clothes . 
i had absolutely no issues with my walgreens one . 
this brand is over hyped and over priced . 
it s very hard to get the settings right . 
this one has nothing to keep it together . 
inferior metal ,  ridiculous cutter material ,  cheap metal with no edge . 
and when i tasted them ,  i could see why . 
this made for extremely frustrating gameplay from the very first level . 
i purchased this to charge my new blackberry bold num_extend
spend some more money and find a quality product . 
i am a big fan of treats that are digestable . 
i dont know how anyone can eat these !  yuck yuck yuck . 
ca fais cher pas mal pour un seul jeu . 
yellow kitty is fed by the back door . 
i sanded ,  i polished ,  over and over again . 
the remote buttons are small ,  close together ,  and not clearly labeled . 
i imagine if you let your dog lead it would be fine . 
in fact i cannot imagine any animal fitting into this . 
and they love to chew toys ,  so i m a bit puzzled . 
some more undercoat came out ,  but the cat was not looking happy . 
they actually told me to try restarting my computer . 
the smell is akin to the cheap spectre tvs costco used to sell . 
if it wasn t such a hassle i would return it . 
i have several old pairs of fownes and they have been great . 
these headphones work perfectly with my num_extend phone . 
this grill is new for num_num and it was very easy to assemble . 
so i advise buying it used and trying it . 
i am probably not going to purchase these again . 
hair product also sticks very easily to the plates requiring clean up constantly . 
i absolutely will never again buy levis products . 
there is only one  town   and it s dull  . 
mount is cheap plastic and customer service could care less . 
high freq notes sound very shrill and broken . 
so it actually makes a bad problem worse . 
my dandruff was mild to moderate ,  never anything crazy . 
the smell didn t dissipate ,  so i had to throw this away . 
i found this version of dove quite disappointing . 
this feeder is a great idea with a poor design . 
i am only wearing these while i wait to buy another pair . 
small pills of fuzz appeared after every few wipes . 
i got bored with this really ,  really quick . 
this is a joke and not worth my time . 
like i will ever buy another hoover product after this fiasco . 
but buyers believe it on the printed label . 
it s time to move out of the stone age . 
if you try to uninstall steam the game will not boot up . 
sadly ,  this tea does not rise to that level of distinction . 
got one for myself and one for my wife . 
so avoid touching your eyes at all costs . too bad . 
they were easy enough to make right ,  though . 
the manual says the range for good quality is about num_num feet . 
i d say it works as well as most deodorants do . 
but after a while ,  the bluetooth gave out . 
i mean they are okay but barely okay . 
no way would i pay any money for it . 
my dogs usually chow down their food really fast . 
i think that i was hoping for something that it isn t . 
fits tightly for a month or two anyway . 
on the plus side it had excellent power while it was functioning . 
it tastes ok ,  but you can find much better . 
i need at least a num_extend maybe num_extend
we bought a night splint for him to use instead . 
so ,  all in all ,  the num_num star reviewers were right . 
it s much less than that of the conair infiniti . 
after a couple of uses ,  it soaked oil from pizzas . 
it becomes a brick instead of a light gaming console . 
they agreed with me and issued me a complete refund . 
i think this will end up in the trash . 
i gave my dog composure for about num_num week plus and nothing changed . 
threw in the garbage after seeing no results in several weeks . 
i think someone else likened it to a  cracker jack toy  . 
the silver piece on the back ,  popped off after a couple days . 
i looked on the sizing chart and everything . 
you can t even attack ,  whats up with that . 
when it comes to taste ,  it was lacking . 
i didn t know what to do with it after it dried up . 
beautiful to look at but finish was chalky . 
it never tells you which side to use . 
it has lots of impressive looking meters but lacks performance for its pricepoint . 
the game uses a heavily modified version of the quake num_num engine . 
i ll stick to that ingredient from now on . 
with a phone call you trade places and play as the other . 
only num_num tricks are customizeable ,  but that s not the problem . 
therefore ,  i have lowered my rating to num_num stars . 
i have used it for num_num years and it is a work horse . 
i was really disappointed of the broken box taped in bubble wrap . 
the problem :  it would not allow me to uninstall . 
this full num_num degree viewing is totally gross . 
we will no longer feed these to any of our dogs ,  ever . 
you can send stuff to each other ,  and expand them . 
works ok as an audio cd player though . 
so ,  i returned it and got my num_extend unit . 
there isnt any variety at all to the gameplay . 
i loved this coat for my dog when it first came . 
the autofocus doesn t work correctly in anything but bright sunlight . 
if you care about your health ,  choose a different sweetener . 
smokey did not want to have anything to do with it . 
bought two of these cables last week for a tradeshow in las vegas . 
then the same thing happened with that side . 
it has turned out to be one expensive water bowl . 
so this stupid thing has died twice in less than six months . 
i measured my knee before ordering and ordered the medium . 
i m going to go with a different brand next time . 
i bought these num_num lights to try before buying a num_num set . 
i did like the fresh mint and left my mouth fresh and minty . 
so i only took on days that i might have missed this protocol . 
if you can read the tiny little screen ,  this thing records nicely . 
the problem is that i have yet to find that perfect product . 
i want them covered and supported and this bra did neither . 
my previous dog loved them ,  so i don t know why . 
the phone has a charger in the box . 
it fell apart as soon as i got it . 
i have contacted them again ,  but they have not responded . 
the only thing they stick well to is metal . 
i couldn t believe they charged me over $ for it . 
this is just really drying and made my spots ten times worse . 
my num_num month old daughter certainly wouldn t be able to do it . 
i love the color but the design was not what is should be . 
needless to say ,  it was not a good looking shoe . 
you replied and i explained in simple terms what was wrong . 
the catnip drives the kitties crazier than usual . 
i dont know why they put that plane in the game . 
this polish was too dark for my taste . 
it does move air around but that s about it . 
the most flimsy camera nikon has ever made with a very bad lens . 
there is no timer or stop watch function on this num_extend audio quality . 
this product is a complete waste of money . 
with joint problems use this at once ,  it really works for them . 
i kept dropping them  ,  i bought but deeply regret buying a clie . 
their sound is marked by a midrange that is mia . 
any bass seems to make them strain and distort . 
i bought this product for a few reasons . 
they have a great crunch ,  buy have almost a bitter taste . 
just not as pictured at all so don t buy it . 
i understand the sequel is supposed to be much better ,  but . 
guess i should ve stuck with the more expensive kind that actually works . 
i ve tried other products from this company that worked . 
this product didn t work as well as i had hoped . 
anyhow ,  i will not be repeating this order . 
the covering on the buttons make it very hard to operate . 
but they are tight fitting around the foot . 
it has a battery for a virating shave . 
i did that wile in the bios too . 
but $ isn t worth the hassle of packing up and sending back . 
i am very disappointed in this belkin product . 
i could honestly wash my face with an exfoliant and feel more revived . 
this one is defective and unfortunately it s over num_num days since delivery . 
and some of the characters are fairly interesting . 
guess i m not the hipster i thought i was . 
they also made my face feel dry and parched . 
when i loaded the software onto my computer ,  the problems began . 
i had my sks for num_extend with no issues . 
fiskars badly missed the target on this one . 
but then i noticed there was no battles . 
the wrinkling is slight and right across the center . 
also ,  the board has odd pictures for the letter . 
magnets are not strong enough to even carry very light kitchen utensils . 
my num_num siberian huskies and my lab mix would not play with ball . 
also zoomed out all the way the clarity was terrible . 
i will never deviate from what i know to be true again . 
and please don t use the  but my dog likes this brand  test . 
no matter how you fix them nothing made them taste good . 
feel free to repeat this  or similar  process periodically . 
i will update if the unit fails too soon . 
it s extremely rare nowadays and for good reason . 
my cholestrol came down to num_num but my liver enzymes went up . 
i could go on and on but i think that s enough . 
i won t be going back to goddess bra s ever . 
the worst cover art i ve ever seen for a game . 
this was a gift to our son at num_num months old . 
because they still buy the same type of bras their mothers wore . 
feels well made but is not powerful enough . 
the crease brush is huge and not good for creases . 
if you don t have vista i m sure it works fine . 
a roll of num_num cookies in a pack . 
it s more fun and at least has the benefit of originality . 
after reading the reviews here ,  i am perplexed . 
the molds need to be easier to clean out . 
i bought num_num more bra s along with this one . 
even when you get the hang of things ,  you never really do . 
if anything this stuff made me want to eat more . 
if you want a baseball game for your dreamcast get wsb num_extend
although more watery than shaving cream ,  the noxzema worked out reasonably well . 
very good heater ,  keeps temp within num_extend degrees f . 
i still would advice against purchasing this item ,  however . 
i was looking for something to smooth out my dry hair . 
those who aren t voiced by celebrities don t sound all that great . 
the description of this product met that search . 
at least i didn t pay twice that for this dog . 
i disliked them enough that i am returning them today . 
if you take the new weebles out ,  it spins . 
some of my friends who baked cakes ,  breads ,  etc . 
i also did not care for the smoky taste . 
is there anything good to say about this game ?  ?  ?  no . 
don t buy it ,  it ll be money down the drain . 
this is ok but just wasnt what i hoped it would be . 
to call this input device a  trackball  is misleading . 
bah !  can t believe these things have the gold toe label . 
normally ,  i love things from oxo good grips . 
not hammie ,  not meaty ,  just a salty rubbery texture . 
perhaps the maker will be destressed and see what they can do . 
but this did not work for me at all . 
first of all these say that they re ardell lashes . 
just needed something to boil water for my morning coffee . 
anything would be more thought provoking and challenging than red faction num_extend
however ,  none of them like these ,  not even num_num out of num_extend
so the vendor sent my stuff in that condition . 
i ve never had a shoe brand not fit one way or another . 
this managed to get tons and tons of this stuff in the air . 
i understand this is endemic in many copies . 
belts are inexpensive so i plan to replace it yearly . 
by the way most of them are old ports of playstation games . 
this new design is thick and too heavy . 
our baby didn t even have num_num whole day to enjoy it . 
my main gripe is how terrible they are in the ice and snow . 
maybe the fleas have built up a tolerance to it . 
ink isn t cheap and it doesn t last very long . 
i had fashion plates as a girl and never remember having any issues . 
for the price ,  this truck should be more durable . 
this added an element of challenge and fun to the zelda franchise . 
received quickly ,  tried to install but would not fit my truck . 
i m so glade it didn t damage my skin . 
if you want a horrible but babe game buy it !  . 
the graphics looked like something from num_extend or the orginal xbox . 
activision failed to keep the hot streak going with this franchise . 
sadly this is poorly implemented in legend of mana  lom  . 
i consume onion all the time which are the best . 
i m going to buy a wooden one like they use in mexico . 
this thing rolled away a long time ago . 
finally the screw vibrated loose and i lost it somewhere . 
i do not recommend this leash to anyone . 
even the nintendo ds is just a slightly improved sp . 
if forced in place it pops off once pressure is relieved . 
i have had this camera for about num_num months . 
i got a regular ,  to long ,  instead of a short . 
busting the cd into little pieces was gratifying . 
could get phone to turn on and charge battery . 
how very disappointing for a brand that markets itself as healthy . 
while i m on the subject ,  the graphics are terrible . 
not a fan at all of this knockoff ,  folks . 
i received a huge box on my front porch today . 
one dog is allergic to both and i read labels . 
i have owned one of these burr grinders . 
the car charger plug died with in num_num weeks . 
slow and uninspring ,  this game lacks any new imagination . 
the top runs num_num sizes smaller than what is normal . 
goes to show brand name is not always better . 
it didn t make my blonde hair all that shiny . 
makes the taste horrible so it s impossible to use . 
i was hoping that the litter would be trapped better into the mat . 
when the box arrived ,  i saw loose tea under the cellophane . 
the product does not provide the required voltage to charge the phone . 
it was like they sort of skidded or did not funstion properly . 
people are giving this camera num_num while defending its flaws . 
i gave some to my num_extend son who typically loves stuff like this . 
i wish there was some kind of notch to indicate the level position . 
it is total and complete waste of your money and time . 
that is not the worst of the problems i have encountered . 
it is not very sturdy and does not hold up well . 
then i ll give it to a friend who likes to tinker . 
num_extend the inner plastic case is very hard to open . 
the only thing that is pretty decent is the wig . 
i wasted about an hour of my life with this device . 
i wanted to love this because of all its positive aspects . 
very disappointed with the quality and functionality of this gate . 
it does not feel like a successor to civilization ii . 
i bought one of these for my business and one for my home . 
that and the shipping was certainly nothing close to what they charged . 
this particular blend does not make the cut . 
i only got num_num out of num_num that were okay . 
it s like a peel ,  but not as harsh or drastic . 
but even my powder eye shadow does go on with these . 
my dog loved the original purina one adult chicken with rice dog food . 
it fit strangely and it is not soft at all . 
you cant troll or land fish one handed . 
contrary to the image used ,  the chute cannot go flat . 
i would recommend you look elsewhere for something of higher quality . 
was not worth the cost and trouble to return . 
it s a pleasant fragrance ,  i just should have saved my money . 
you just play long enough and you ll eventually unlock it all . 
jet fuel is by far the least tasty of the brews . 
this case is light and fits very tight . 
already familiar with this brand ,  i expected a quality product . 
my ankle immediately starts hurting when i stand on this shoe . 
the one i ordered came with only one . 
i am very dissapointed that people would have overlooked this very simple detail . 
poor quality and ran num_num to num_extend sizes too large for me . 
but warning ,  you ll feel ripped off if you rent it too . 
i enjoyed zelda phantom hourglass ,  but could not get into this one . 
why do this ?  i simply don t understand it . 
the build quality is less than i expected and feels really shabby . 
but i don t like saying i hate it . 
i couldn t drink enough water i was sweating so bad . 
update april num_extend gave it to my school teacher son . 
finally someone has built a better system then num_extend and gamecube . 
supposedly the warrior is the start all and end all class . 
ntfs access was deliberately disabled from the embedded linux running num_extend
so just use that instead plus my reiko case . 
the smell is actually quite pleasant ,  it s a clean fresh scent . 
i am charging the battery through a seperate dock charger . 
if you are not strong you will not get it together . 
this phone case sucks and the tail doesn t work . 
linksys technical support first indicated i had a defective unit . 
however ,  recently i ordered full fat coconut milk . 
i love my mac ,  but quality is definitely going down . 
i saw absolutely no difference in his behavior . 
this is a nice selection of wet flies . 
ended up throwing out to the birds ,  squirrels . 
it s quite honestly the only decent automated litter box . 
so far she has had little interest in it . 
i m not happy at all about this transaction . 
it tastes like pure spearmint oil to me . 
i believe this product was not good anymore . 
jarrow ,  spectrum ,  nutiva ,  vitacost and swanson are much better . 
these looked like they were damaged before and probably during the packaging . 
number one ,  i don t like how in humane this is . 
i definitely prefer the gel cleanser from yonka to the lotion cleanser . 
it reminds me of the wet food i feed my cats . 
then i ratcheted up the difficulty and still won by num_extend
so ,  for ginger lovers only all others should probably steer clear . 
just too burnt bitter a taste for me . 
liked the price ,  for sure ,  but won t buy it again . 
just beware of possible side effects like this . 
i bought these cables to hook up a computer to a projector . 
i used it consistently for a month and no results . 
then again ,  playing this game was kind of like that . 
i m in afghanistan so i can t return them easily either . 
i will keep this review updated as things change . 
the amazing thing is it is not drying or peeling . 
it uses voip calling backed up by both sprint cell and verizon roaming . 
this mirror does not really work with my sunglasses . 
the sleeves were so long it made him look like a child . 
it was almost exactly the same as medal of honor frontline . 
so ,  both the new screws and old screws are useless . 
i now have a tracking number and hope for a total refund . 
that s about all i can see these being used for . 
i love most chai teas and this reminds me of those . 
my guinea pigs have gone through many water bottles . 
i think this is only a problem for larger dogs . 
the intellimouse is simply the best mouse i ve ever used . 
i was hoping the bad reviews were wrong on this product . 
stopped working after less than a few month s of sporadic use . 
i was given one of these at work . 
i run at the gym and they fell off twice . 
he sniffed it and turned away from it . 
i would never try any philips products again . 
after bedtime ,  i put s mores together with no problems . 
so the cost is pretty high to use these tablets . 
we had two old kongs this size ,   large  that lasted for years . 
otherwise ,  these are too expensive for me to buy again . 
yet another waste of money on my part . 
it s the fact that the enemy ai is literally retarded . 
we sent it back and purchased a smaller one . 
i ve done this before with other presta tubes no problem . 
i already had three koss headphones :  portapro ,  num_extend and num_extend
doesn t smell like mimosa ,  maybe a whiff of num_extend
it was a waste of money for me . 
this certainly does protect my phone from scratches . 
barbers have said no to giving me a shave . 
however ,  it was pretty much useless for us . 
one of my other favorite features is that you can upgrade the filmware . 
it has too much cotton in it and not enough polyester or knit . 
i bought two and both broke in less than a month . 
i d say this is just your average hair dryer . 
expect intuitive city management and troop creation menus . 
the return policy is worthless ,  you are better off purchasing another unit . 
i never got much use out of them . 
i got this as a freebie with my invicta watch purchase . 
it was bound to happen; it was only a matter of time . 
i found them too uncomfortable to wear for the entire night . 
i have had inconsistent experiences with bewley s teas in north america . 
i would definately try to get a sample packet before buying in bulk . 
i was dissatisfied and disappointed with this product . 
i d used my old pressure cooker for over num_num years . 
ventilation ain t the issue ,  louie  the microsoft tech s name  . 
i thought i was ordering the pizza crust which our family just loves . 
again ,  no reflections on the guns ,  but we do have shadows . 
do not waste your money on this item . 
otherwise ,  i d recommend skipping this and looking elsewhere . 
it has one high point ,  which is odor control . 
the pictures are grainy and you can t look at them . 
just in time to change the cartridge again  talk about annoying  . 
brand new . ping pals didn t even hit that low . 
it was also much smaller than i expected it to be . 
controlling the game is terrible especially the putting ,  which is almost impossible . 
it is the manufacturer who packaged the item who is deceiving buyers . 
it got very annoying ,  so i never finnished the game . 
get final fantasy xi ,  or dark age of camelot or something . 
my dog likes round rawhides ,  so i tried this as an alternative . 
would have given four stars if it had been complete . 
using the keyboard for this game is just plain awful . 
didn t slide when i tried moving them around . 
the first ones i owned ,  the flimsy cord broke . 
the cord seems permanently attached unless you snip it off with scissors . 
it breaks where the handle meets the paddle . 
this was just a waste of $ in my opinion . 
perhaps it works only on minor aches and pains . 
right out of the box i could tell . 
i am supposed to receive it within num_num weeks . 
it has poor quality sound so its hard to play the game . 
fighting battles in your saucer is also difficult due to this . 
i thought this was so cute and it was . 
the base is too small ,  the blades are not that sharp . 
love the color ,  made it easy to find in my purse etc . 
that right there is the gravy though ,  fire starter . 
just don t buy these cheap things ,  even for training . 
and chess kombat ,  to name the main elements . 
cans of cat food ,  not the num_num oz . 
the seeds do grow ,  however it will be messy . 
so rhyno cannot do gore after gore ,  because he would get tired . 
so what good is an upgradeable remote when you cant get customer service . 
someone gave this as a gift to my dog . 
they are not weak or gentle with their toys . 
these are not the docs i normally wear . 
i had wanted a product like its description and am disappointed in it . 
the coffee is not any better than my way less expensive coffeemaker . 
btw ,  my cat is a full grown large male . 
the star on the front turns and clicks . 
should the watch stay wound reasonable time ,  i d buy it again . 
only buy this for the outfit and accessories . 
it only tastes like cinnamon as i like cinnamon on my toast . 
the packaging states the bubbles will leave a white residue when they dry . 
i won t be feeding this to my dog . 
i wanted this bread tray to match what i already have . 
she figured out what it was and began to just ignore the sound . 
this smoothie really tasted a lot more like medicine than a smoothie drink . 
spend a little more and save the hassle . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
put in fresh batteries and it won t turn on at all . 
i have a decently sensitive nose ,  and i just cannot handle it . 
it also was not easy to apply as it streaked and applied unevenly . 
the collar itself is kind of cheap and not very well designed . 
the vacmaster container was sealed at the same pressure level with no problems . 
also ,  there are way too many of them . 
first time i plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly . 
this is supposed to be a quick release collar . 
my son seems to like it so far though . 
sadly this is not a case i will be using often or recommending . 
it is an okay product but not for my i phone . 
or worse . imodium itself is good at what it does . 
the back starts to turn a different color from using it often . 
you then shoot him in the back of the head . 
the num_num sterile gauze pads are in a wax paper like wrapper . 
this is just way too much work for me . 
i should have read other reviews before buying this cable . 
the speaker that did work sounded pretty good though . 
what if i had left him alone with it . the story ends . 
well the maker of this product has a bad surprise for you . 
she immediately ordered me to take a shower . 
it knocks when the light is on ,  when it s heating . 
in the picture you see the wide comfort waistband . 
scared the living daylights out of my cats and family . 
i wasn t pulling on them ,  they just came out . 
the dryer is only num_num watts ,  not exactly powerful . 
i ve a had my now for a little less than a year . 
second ,  the bar does not have any knurling for tricep workouts . 
i tried it this morning in my coffee . 
the steel is very hard and should hold and edge . 
as soon as i received the product ,  i took one per directions . 
was hoping to control ammonia levels a bit better with this . 
no adjustment of the seat i found relieved this pain . 
next time i ll take the negative comments more into consideration . 
consider this :  the primary ingredient of chicken mcnuggets is also chicken . 
this would not charge my ipad even though the listing said it would . 
i am on the fence about returning this to amazon . 
it finally went out on me after a ton of abuse and travel . 
i use it about num_num times a week . 
the quality was nice and they were enjoyable to use . 
it didn t fit my suv s factory cargo holder . 
it is not a picture of the item they sent me . 
i ordered num_num and i am returning them . 
i swear .  .  . that was the epitomy of all gaming . 
they still slipped and looked really dirty really quickly . 
not because of careless ,  but of the cdr surface quality . 
it did not fill the huge shoes of my reliable manipulator . 
i haven t tried it yet since i m discouraged before i start . 
get the sym smaller helicopter for indoor use as that was fabulous . 
have reused them as planting stakes in my garden . 
i went back through the trails but didn t find it . 
we will not be buying this product in the future . 
but this is pretty much the essence of the game . 
the anchor points for the posts have broken repeatedly . 
i bought this sometime ago ,  the one star says i hate it . 
i ve used other products and this one is my least favorite . 
bc no one order this stuff like me . 
they are not very comfortable ,  just like every on the ear design . 
it lasted one year after the warranty ended with very little use . 
another fail on the part of the adapter . 
the stairs also got dirty faster than ever after i used this product . 
i also love the freeze dried peaches by other companies . 
they have learned how to make potatoes out of plastic . 
it is a good idea if it was better made . 
a penny more and it is a waste of your hard earned money . 
and the sugar alcohol gives you horrible gas . 
i tried a couple of applications in various places . 
the game gets really repetitve when you beat it unlike gta . 
not compatible with nfc ,  you can t beam or use bluetooth either . 
at the time she was num_num months old . 
i found myself fart around half the time . 
its day num_num and my stomach still hurts trying to digest this creatine . 
both num_extend pants were too tight through the seat and thigh . 
it s very very strong which is not my taste . 
i think i like wyler s a little better . 
it was good for a while ,  then it started being bad . 
central standard time if you would like additional information . 
the rear sight would not slide into place on my num_extend glock num_extend
amazon was prompt and courteous with returning my purchase price . 
be clear ,  it was not a minor amount . 
don t get me wrong ,  i like the basic game engine . 
think micro scratches on your clear coat if you have a newer car . 
it would run fine without a can in it . 
i loved these canisters for about num_num years . 
grappling doors and enemies isn t very fun either . 
i was disappointed and had hoped for more . 
peppermint flavor has a strong beginning and a weak ending . 
i walked back out to the pickup to get the next box . 
was heavy ,  noisy and it didn t even cut that close . 
and i think it may actually be helping the fungus grow faster . 
others had the same problem that i read in the reviews . 
if that bar was curved ,  it d work ,  but its straight . 
the shirtd does have the champion logo patch i remember . 
it kind of makes me feel like the whole thing is dirty . 
now i use shark ,  which is a lot better . 
most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie . 
that s how many i ate when i got it . 
it was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti . 
i echo the rest of the reviews on this site . 
this powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when i wear it . 
i have a specialized hardrock and it did not fit my bike . 
then after only num_num months it completely quit working . 
sharp cat nail clippers do the job nicely . 
this is a belkin cable and came in the sealed packaging as shown . 
this is the first time i purchased a topical benadryl for rashes . 
the gel isnt shinny enough and i wont be purchasing this brand again . 
i don t care that much about processor speed ,  apps ,  etc . 
this was a gift for my son s num_extend birthday . 
these tablets really dissolve really quickly ,  similar to a chewable . 
maybe i just wound up with bad one ,  but beware !  . 
buy this product only if you have virgin hair !  !  !  . 
there was almost no peach flavor and it was supposed to be sweetened . 
the grapics are good and the load times are quick  saving is agonizing  . 
listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster . 
i had high hopes for this cereal based on others reviews . 
i was thinking of more chocolate than mud taste for this product . 
it is rechargeable ,  comes with its own charger stand . 
there s minimal space to adjust the shoulder straps . 
clever realization of super powers ?  um ,  again ,  not so much . 
i think over time it will distort the plastic around the slot . 
the review here is solely to warn unsuspecting consumers . 
the texture is like milk of magnesia ,  which makes this really disgusting . 
i wear a size num_num so i thought i should be fine . 
this item was to be used for the purpose of skiing . 
these are just not as good as they re supposed to be . 
my grandson has not yet mastered it ,  not for lack of trying . 
shipment from the vendor was fast and no problem . 
i think it is a counterfeit of blackberry oem one . 
person and tried this junk in my prep . 
go to sally and get better quality for the same price range . 
ok .  . been a palm customer for a few years here . 
i m actually a big fan of olay regenerist . 
unfortunately ,  it did not turn out to be the case . 
vanicream num_extend offers titanium dioxide % zinc oxide %
they are double the price but num_num times the quality . 
i wouldn t purchase again and don t recommend either . 
i decided to buy her this to just give it a try . 
that leads to a lot of wrong turns and backtracking through levels . 
i liked the look of these when they arrived . 
they came off right away and weren t very stable on my screen . 
my hair stylist noticed it and couldn t figure out what was wrong . 
the price was so cheap that i went ahead and ordered two more . 
you will be in for a long cold night . 
the product probably cost them $ to buy from the crap chinese manufacturer . 
they feel less like the sound is in a tin can . 
waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task . 
num_num hours with heavy use ,  no bluetooth or wifi enabled . 
i ve had one nail break and another crack from the side . 
and there was no mention of this promotion in the item description . 
i originally had a ge electric knife for over num_num years . 
have already thrown away and will not ever reorder this stuff again . 
i remember these games being so much better . 
and dont get me started at the warior template . 
the pear isn t as crispy as the apple . 
they sound much worse than my $ sony earphones . 
healthy foods for healthy mind and body not chemicals . 
i do not like the consistency of the product . 
so there was no way i could use it . 
have gone back to just a plastic litter box with far less smell . 
i wouldn t even sell this used to anyone . 
i ve had this can opener for a few years now . 
using a soft bristle brush ,  i brush in the product . 
but i prefer the suction cups ,  those fly more accurately as well . 
the entire product is based on misleading hype . 
this product is sold in pet stores all around the country . 
cute case ,  but it is too bulky to plug in a charger . 
it took about num_num minutes to brew num_num cups . 
this was the bowl where the spraying cat often ate . 
two of them were really nice and i was pleasantly surprised . 
this product smells and feels too much like sunscreen for me . 
and it tasted much more like sardine than salmon . 
so ,  i took it apart to see what went wrong . 
definitely not sharp enough to cut without discomfort . 
it has a good feel in the hand . 
shocked !  do no waste your money on these . 
my dog  which loves tuna  just refused to eat this . 
it is truly odor free ,  which is nice . 
i don t know what happened or why it didn t get here . 
kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste . 
on the very first shot for each target ,  the sticker flew off . 
the first time it just had trouble holding my interest . 
our cat  orange tabby  likes kickers but for some reason ignores this one . 
would like to know if anyone else has had this problem . 
smoke issued from the bottom and it was too scary to use anymore . 
it s made of cheap plastic and is very weak . 
my regular size would have been too small . 
my cat is totally uninterested in this toy . 
you can t miss it this time of year . 
maybe it s time to get an hdmi graphics card . 
it turned on and i saw it was at % battery . 
this was definitely not the best digestive enzyme for my body . 
i also tried bowing them out with no improvement . 
coleman better source from a better supplier than this made in india junk . 
i think the ad photo has it right . 
if so ,  i m out the ten bucks ,  but i tried . 
when you plug it in ,  it says it is fully charged . 
i was not a fan of the smell either . 
they are difficult to hold steady and difficult keep focused . 
i ve been playing civ since civ num_num back in the early nineties . 
i would not recommend or buy this product or products like it again . 
for expensive shampoos ,  i like matrix and bed head products . 
i knew i needed a stone so i bought this one . 
i ordered num_num of these cases as gifts . 
i give this credit where it is due . 
we were not aware that this was a form of a choke collar . 
check out the facebook page animal parents against pet treats made in china . 
i bought this for all the amazing reviews . 
so i decided to reorder from the same company . 
the scent is too artificial and it is not effective at all . 
i bought this game thinking that i could play it on my own . 
the holes are too small for the posts . 
i would buy this if it always worked ,  but it doesn t . 
i used these ankle weights for a long time . 
wasn t blown away by the coffee it made either . 
for some reason i could not get the cuff on tight . 
i read the reviews so i was expecting a solid product . 
i bought this because i loved optical mice . 
the sizers slip and slide around the ring and sometimes pop off . 
plugged in the ac power adapter that came with the unit . 
purchased this battery as spare battery for my canon num_extend
i liked it well enough to use it . 
fan started making a loud noise and just quit . 
what you see and what the life gauge shows are often very different . 
this game has nothing to do with the epic looking cover label art . 
but it s marketed as something that will provide you with energy . 
i ve been using proactiv for maybe ten years and still break out . 
my new fusion num_num air pump is decidedly not quiet . 
but for whatever reason the odor control is horrible . 
i can see how this would be an allure to small dogs . 
my wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden . 
i bought it because of the other excellent comparative reviews . 
the hd s simply blow the older model away . 
the primer is cakey and a sticky mess . 
i was mad too ,  because i bought an expansion pack as well . 
doesn t even come close to my older and less expensive spinner . 
in the exact sense of the word ,  the game cheated me . 
now i have to try to unload these jeans on somebody else . 
it s cheap plastic with a lot of play in it . 
i have other num_extend cords and this one will be trash soon . 
nobue uematsu left them and they replaced him with some clueless punk . 
but the black on the stripes wore off really fast . 
mug or kill someone and the police are on to you . 
my daughter had destroyed a few pages in a week . 
they are not large enough ,  and fairly inflexible . 
dont buy it even if you liked jak and daxter . 
it plays like a genesis game with crude num_extend backgrounds . 
i ll not even talk about the scam that is the drm . 
still ,  it smells and tastes like oil gone bad . 
the chemical is absorbed into the skin ,  readily . 
but ea is making that impossible with this ridiculous scheme . 
 sony  has now become part of my vocabulary . 
good graphics ,  great story ,  and a huge fan base . 
i m also don t want to be taking pineal glands . 
the bottom two corners of the remote are kind of square and sharp . 
the quality of the picture is too blurry . 
these usb cables are not the original samsung usb cables . 
not a geyser of brown scalding hot liquid spewing everywhere in the kitchen . 
this is what i was expecting when i drank it . 
so i m sorry but i have to give this perfume two stars . 
the end of final fantasy as we know it . 
i don t think i will be ordering it again . 
he wouldn t lick it alone on a plate . 
the powdered cheese was all over the place . 
it melts right off your face after about num_num hours . 
i really liked this little bag for about num_num minutes . 
i have never written any review for any product so far . 
i seemed to stay pretty dry during my morning walk . 
we decided to try again ,  and had the same results . 
being a good samaritan can have its downfalls at times . 
meantime i noticed the same as i got in the water . 
hodgson mill needs to change this produce or lose it all together . 
she didn t really take to it and now ignores it . 
all the slime did was ooze out like snot . 
i iced my eyes most of the day . 
it s not that it can t catch a mouse . 
the inside card slots have stretched out and look awful . 
but you have to be very diligent with it . 
i thought perhaps indian quality may be better . 
grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game . 
it pulled hair from my face rather then cutting it . 
they preferred the older snoozzy beds for some reason . 
the quad split screen was a big nuisance . 
it weighs nothing and is easy to use on hikes . 
i have a num_num glastron num_extend with a mercruiser num_extend and mercruiser sterndrive . 
on the plus side ,  amazon s return process was very easy . 
this stuff appeared to have no affect at all . 
i like the low profile design ,  but cannot recommend based on quality . 
it looks like like the picture and installing it was a snap . 
i ll use these until they entirely tick me off . 
i think i ll toss the stamp pads and keep the stamps . 
you are forced to go to your carrier . 
also the cups are very thin material and not lined . 
don t even think of fitting peg or sound puzzles into this . 
i picked up a set of these from best buy tonight . 
had i not wanted to actually use it ,  it would be fine . 
just a note about two technical problems i had with this game . 
the problem with this bird is the poor trim control . 
let me just say how much i love amazon . 
i cleaned my screen before applying them ,  and still no luck . 
first wash the bandana began to unravel by itself . 
this game should of never been made for game boy . 
i prefer using regular batteries now ,  since they last so much longer . 
it is so soft ,  that the fir is lose . 
don t bother even buying this till it s on the $ rack . 
but all in all ,  i could not stand the taste . 
it was decent on short hair ,  but not great either . 
a few days later ,  odd lumps appeared and have not gone away . 
i am very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of this product . 
it makes my hair hard to comb through . 
i borrowed my daughters elf primer and liked it much better . 
the second thing i noticed is where it s made . 
my desktop computer could not get out on the internet . 
i won t be purchasing any of these again . 
that breaks down to $ x num_num oz . 
i give this a num_num based off my usage . 
i highly recommend the santuko shape ,  but not kitchenaid s handle design . 
i think you ll be frustrated and disappointed in the end . 
an equally unforgivable offense is the atrocious  d pad  . 
then i needed somewhere for quick access to my phone . 
instead ,  you  hotswap  to another soldier on the battlefield . 
i bought three of these as gifts ,  one for my own child . 
i feel that the game shouldn t even be allowed to be sold . 
hopefully it lasts long enough for me to find one in stores . 
after repeated use ,  thesheath looses it s ability to retain the knife . 
it hasn t broken ,  but it is light and flimsy . 
this time; however ,  it simply did not work . 
ive spent entirely too much time trying to adjust the pack . 
from what i m reading here ,  it probably isn t the problem . 
it takes a little bit of creativity to separate them . 
it would overshoot due to moving too fast even on the slowest speeds . 
also the list price is too high on this amazon site . 
i thought it said num_extend not num_extend inchs . 
but i m not using it for towing or emergency recovery . 
i found the beatle blowing me away in a audi tt . 
the hummers use every single feeder .  .  .  . except this one . 
it was so firm ,  it felt like a filled sandbag . 
i do not recommend this skirt at all . 
easy to use and a nice ,  light tactile response . 
these skin protectors will last you longer that your phone or tablet . 
if they do not work or do not last ,  they are worthless . 
there s something weird with the keyboard layout that makes texting really num_extend
i jumped onto amazon and sure enough there it was . 
it turns out that this  liveaction  mic will not work with the software . 
if i held the usb cable in place it would charge my phone . 
it gives me a feeling that the product is inferior or cheap . 
it is like the consistency of yogurt ,  only with lots of oils . 
the description and picture shows cars num_extend not cars num_extend
that option won t turn on at all ,  it says  activation required  . 
the only good thing about this product is the bottle . 
babies has to push a bit harder to get the num_extend
it sat in the fermenter for num_num months ,  forgotten . 
the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before . 
even the very first level  the street level  is pretty tough . 
this one is just way more trouble than it s worth . 
this bag is ideal if you need minimal things . 
this should give you an idea as to what to expect . 
for that it is coming off right away !  . 
but probably better to wait for the jewel case release . 
basically ,  this in one time that you get what you pay for . 
i will use it up but i will not purchase this product again . 
the other squeak toys do not scare him . 
i havent found any of the soups from amys good . 
timex use to be a great company not so now . 
buy a more expensive one and save your dollar . 
try sennheiser hd num_extend you will not be disappointed . 
go figure .  .  . one month after the warranty was up . 
this is a waste of time and money . 
the reason i gave these jeans a num_num is because they shrink . 
i should have paid closer attention to the ingredients . 
i found no customer support or warranty information in the package or online . 
at first these jeans were a good fit . 
i really thought i had a winner with this steamer . 
i really wanted this to work ,  but it doesn t . 
there s only room enough for one bleeder in my house . 
maybe a shoe stretcher would have worked better . 
just do everyone a favor and go out of business . 
this item ,  as listed ,  costs $ per box . 
the last batch of xl s i ordered were perfect . 
you have to very delicately lay on the pasta . 
i have requested a replacement and hope the next one is normal . 
i had to remove it from him before he started eating the pieces . 
if you have medium to large hands ,  it will be too small . 
i almost threw up when i opened it . 
i would have rated it minus num_num stars . 
this is the first time i ve noticed this on a supplement . 
my cat chomped down on it and broke the sound chip . 
even from the outset ,  it did not toast very evenly . 
kind of a bummer because i thought that would be cool . 
this makes the screen easy to read ,  even in dim light . 
they were easy to put together and very ,  very difficult to use . 
also ,  the button didn t seem to work correctly for us . 
really disappointed i spent $ on this useless thing . 
i would rather pay $ on something that works . 
but she has had the same flip phone forever . 
i have been careful with the stand and it has been fine . 
the color is a great black and it goes on pretty easily . 
it really doesn t seem to be a very robust case . 
unfortunately there is no better alternative at this pricep oint . 
num_extend is not a good game on any terms . 
but i had decent expectations about nikon which i regret now !  . 
i ve been using this router for a couple of years . 
after num_num nights of using it my cracked heels are actually worse . 
mainly it is a waster of time and money . 
eventually ,  the cheapy plastic got torn and the stencils were lost . 
on one hand ,  these are cheap little routers . 
cute slick production ,  but short on material and songs . 
if it helped anything ,  it wasn t enough to notice . 
i must admit i was disappointed with this product . 
and once in awhile rolled off of the toy shelf when put away . 
the edge is absolutely horrible; it s too high . 
we bought this for our three year old for christmas . 
my review is on this review and not this seller . 
we ve had our presto num_num coffee maker for about a year . 
all i can say is that this is a piece of junk . 
forget about the num_num grams of fiber per cup . 
it might help some but you have to be careful . 
people i don t even know don t get it . 
i bought this as an alternative to my neutragena . 
it really didn t help the pain at all . 
the smell triggered asthma symptoms so i could not keep it . 
of the entire collection only asteroids can be truly called fun to play . 
but for food i expect a safety seal . 
these in size num_extend were horrendously too big . 
doh !  !  !  !  it s slightly larger than a table spoon . 
the smell of this soap is too strong . 
while the bottle looked nice it didnt meet my expectations with the nozzle . 
looks nothing like the picture ,  it is hideously ugly . 
this stuff stinks horribly and leaves a terrible film on hair . 
the digital pressure gauge doesn t seem to work at all . 
i believe there is a problem with the labelling . 
however ,  neither the jars nor the lids are high quality . 
should have tried your product before ordering large amount . 
too bad because i really wanted this to work . 
it seems unsafe ,  and it certainly doesn t seem worth the money . 
and this for an item i ordered directly from seidio . 
jabra gave me all sorts of headaches to get a new one . 
this knife is very sharp and holds an edge reasonably well . 
my discs on ii were stuck and ruined my zwilling chef knife edge . 
the supposedly chocolate coating left an artificial taste in my mouth . 
however it does make your hair much much healthier and glossy . 
check my other reviews ,  i may have reviewed it too . 
so i don t think weight is a factor . 
obviously its an old model ,  but don t bother regardless . 
more for clowns in a circus than for men in an office . 
i found it very cumbersome to work with . 
i did not like the way this doll looks at all . 
it s beautifully made but the cups were huge on me . 
i started having eye infections soon after using it . 
the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking . 
i am on my num_extend replacement from kensington in a year now . 
well it turns out that i was right . 
once i got it off ,  it left markings all over the matte . 
i rented this game and i played it for about num_num minutes . 
i m so frustrated i don t know where to begin . 
it wont even work for playing gamecube games . 
for safety reasons ,  this toy was thrown out . 
the longest it stayed on my phone was num_num hour . 
i actually really liked this hair dryer while it worked . 
none of these calming or stress relief methods work . 
it honestly looks like it hasn t had an upgrade since num_extend
you can easily cut one with a pair of scissors . 
if it were possible i would give num_num stars . 
the bottle i received in the mail smelled so awful . 
don t waste your time money and energy buying this product . 
the thing broke before i even put bbs in the mag . 
historically ,  my family has had great success with frontline . 
way to small even for a small person . 
never have i a seen a pair of earphones deteriorate so quickly . 
it s a good idea but this one did not work for me . 
my cheap crappy $ store pitchers can take it . 
the exploration system is my primary problem with the game . 
i took one taste and threw the balance in the garbage . 
i should have listened to the reviewers saying this sunscreen is really greasy . 
 actually ,  that is being unkind to small dogs !  !  !   . 
i used to buy loose leaf chai from a place online . 
it s a game that screenshots do not justify . 
i take great care though when throwing this with my kids . 
the conversations you have to listen to are sappy and boring . 
now need to brainstorm how to keep the dirty tsa agent out . 
a bit in the morning and a bit at night . 
i have had two defender series cases and loved the protect . 
otherwise ,  i have the ends of the filter lens in the picture . 
the first couple minutes of having it ,  the mount broke . 
we had bought this a while ago with the two refills . 
i am going back to my orgain protein shakes . 
the boxes are just too short for big cats . 
this electric sharpener nearly ruined my good knives . 
don t buy and expect to bake in this . 
i use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes . 
it is a little on the big side . 
what i had not remembered was the caustic feeling once on my skin . 
i m going to try the pure australian one now . 
i also don t like the way this makeup looks on my face . 
got this compression wrap along with a foam roller . 
indeed the logo comes off with nail polish remover . 
might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor . 
the game is completely incompatible with a number of video cards . 
i have a size large in another brand that fits quite well . 
use your money wisely and avoid this trash . 
this was put out by num_extend games not sega . 
we sent the cord from the unit back and got a replacement unit . 
the product itself looks good and i like the creamy consistency . 
it s kinda cute ,  but not really  fun  or  entertaining  . 
this machine worked very nice the first two times i used it . 
i cannot recommend it to anyone at this point . 
i am going to sell my copy of major league baseball num_extend back . 
grinds end up all over the front of the unit . 
they pulled the sqeaker out and bit the tails off . 
it is bitter no matter what strength i make it . 
the shipment did take longer then i expected . 
took the other two out and cleaned them up . 
knob breaks with regular or less than regular num_extend
i noticed few days back it is playing only one side of speakers . 
it really was the cheapest case i ever bought in every way . 
i promise to rebuy if you fix it . 
they are an inch long and a half an inch wide . 
give me a break !  guess i just have to laugh . 
i immediately put them in the freezer after getting them num_num weeks earlier . 
i would highly recommend checking out other products . 
they just munch them up with their kibble . 
hopefully after a few more plays i can be friends with lara again . 
i tested at home ,  and it worked fine . 
my son raved about it and he has two . 
first of all ,  i m a microsoft certified professional . 
you can not honestly play this and feel like everything is ok . 
they continued to clean effectively but the contact noise was not tolerable . 
not what i d call good ,  but at least drinkable . 
this bowl is aesthetically pleasing ,  but material quality is lacking . 
the sound is even worse now on the other side . 
it could work on the back of a door . 
nevertheless ,  i can t recommend any product that only lasts one time . 
almost every area has sharp jagged residual plastic which could injure a kitten . 
i spit it out because it was disgusting . 
it has a poor finish and gave me an excruciating pain . 
it leaks and its hard to spray enough oil for regular cooking . 
within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems . 
it squeaks and creeks when the motor turns . 
my son got this for christmas last year . 
the great thing about this game are the options available . 
its a challange evertime i want to do my nails . 
i have num_num maltese dogs on which i used this . 
so ,  i ended up throwing away the several boxes i purchased . 
penny s and see if they still carry the  real thing .   . 
i will only use this lens for items far ,  far away . 
there are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare . 
so i didn t get to see if it actuaaly worked or not . 
an old girlfriend of mine bought me the num_extend oz as a gift . 
about a week later i found them swarming one of the baits . 
this item is a cheap knock off of a us military jeep hat . 
but the dye runs when it gets wet . 
will not purchase again and do not recommend . 
a knife is almost as fast ,  yet effortless . 
that kept me trying for a long time . 
i m hoping that skip it returns some day . 
he does love throwing him though !  so there s a positive . 
if you like that sort of thing ,  you ve found it here . 
it worked for num_num months and not it will not charge my phone . 
i ve used about a dozen stereo bluetooth headsets . 
this shampoo is probably best for straight hair textures . 
if you have difficulty swallowing pills forget these . 
too much to spend just to get these headphones back up and running . 
the idea is a good one just poorly manufactured . 
this is just an opinion ,  don t get all hurt . 
then the cheap tabs on the replacement broke within weeks . 
buy a different brand so you can at least get customer service . 
my face looked rather unnatural and uneven after this . 
i have bought a lot of ncstar stuff and always had good luck . 
please put this in the main body of the description . 
every game i play sound be as amazing as the last . 
in the end this only lasted a few weeks . 
measurements :  band num_extend breasts num_extend used to be a num_extend
if that s what you want it for ,  it works fine . 
the cup itself will probably hold two cups of liquid . 
the opposite side is why i m giving this a big thumbs down . 
to me vita coco tastes like sugar water . 
this is simply of one the worst games currently out for the num_extend
and if money is not a problem ,  gucci pour homme . 
then i realized that there s not really anything to do . 
she answered me only when i was considering purchasing the product . 
this one looks good ,  not lumpy like some others . 
i returned them and ordered a different brand . 
otherwise the watch stops unexpectedly when you least expect it . 
it was hideous and i doesn t look anything like the picture . 
i toss some of this on there as a stopgap . 
i do like nylabone brand but this isn t the best so far . 
i doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise . 
it is way too small to cover the screen . 
for less than a dollar shipped i knew i shouldnt have expected much . 
this item never arrived so it cannot be reviewed . 
it takes num_num seconds to get a temperature reading . 
this is normally a great company but don t buy this bra . 
quality is good ,  but this is a big holster . 
i am now afraid to change the bags on the vac though . 
i did use it as directed and used it for over num_num days . 
i wish this had rigid dividers instead of just fabric . 
left a big ,  crusty stain that took me forever to get out . 
it withstood a lot of banging and dropping . 
it was like a creamed soup and had very little lobster in it . 
i m going to return this piece of junk . 
this shoe was about a half to one size too small . 
the odd part seems that this seems to be random . 
this game could have been a great game had bethesda finished it . 
the latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy . 
while it might help some people ,  it didn t help me . 
i find that the text is distorted and fuzzy . 
in fact ,  the resulting color with this product is good as well . 
made my hair break ,  turn green and orange . 
i initially went with the samsung because i trusted the name brand . 
i even switch the cables to different ports . 
i was pleasantly surprise for the first num_num months . 
i found these shoes by searching the women s option for running shoes . 
this is one of the worst games of all time . 
save your money for something up to date and more fun . 
however ,  this was offerred on the vine program . 
i don t like the way it makes your hair feel . 
but honestly ,  i m not a fan of it . 
also ,  the stickers do not adhere to the body very well . 
i myself find it kind of awkward to do so . 
coffee continues to turn out great ,  very tasty and very hot . 
in my opinion this is a toy and it s junk . 
stick to well known brands with plenty of good reviews . 
i think this toy would be great for a smarter breed !  . 
can you say repetitive ?  the game starts out fun . 
it feels like felt and it snot very secure . 
the giro indicator is similar in price and puts this helmet to shame . 
i took this thing apart multiple times to mess with it . 
i was unable to sync them up and try them out . 
if you have a narrow foot ,  these shoes would be great . 
this happens every time i start a new game . 
my hair feels soft but that s pretty much it . 
i drive an num_extend and this headset captures too much background noise . 
the dvr arrived dead out of the box . 
apparently the manufacturer made there money and quit supporting this remote . 
my pool was beautiful before that ,  without this product . 
these were too small even though i used the size chart when ordering . 
maybe someone will buy them out and restructure . 
this is with brewing it in both a drip coffeemaker and a press . 
worked as soon as i put the battery in . 
dog food like this is made for the human palate . 
i have a narrow foot and couldn t get these comfortable . 
instead an extremely annoying philosophical message appears for a number of seconds . 
don t waste your money if you want security on your network . 
they very quickly shipped me a brand new replacement unit at no charge . 
selected this bag in the num_extend size ,  received a num_extend bag . 
however ,  the bag i received was very soft and sweet . 
amazon has been very competitive in price for most of everything . 
the solution in the kit just fills the little apple . 
this is an anchor brand glass batter bowl . 
do yourslef a favor and don t buy it . 
it left peeled off adhesive on the dashboard . 
i wrote a review for the other one that is not good . 
i added some freeze dried peas to liven things up a bit . 
my hair is like stretchy string and we all know what that means . 
this product does not decrease nor repell fleas . 
more difficult ,  but way safer in my opinion . 
at walmart they start at $ up to over $
i had shampooed my hair with the mediocre just not for me shampoo . 
so for her the shirt increased her anxiety . 
i didn t notice any of the skin brightening claims . 
but i didn t order the packaging ,  i ordered the butter . 
the stupid wire keeps getting in the way . 
in other words does not hold him at all . 
this left my hair dry and needing moisturiser . 
they also are too stiff to conform to the contours of my teeth . 
she was excited when these new dancing ones came out . 
i didn t see the big deal in it . 
if you re an experienced player ,  just read past it . 
after reading the disclaimer that it is known to cause cancer . 
i researched these speakers extensively before purchasing them . 
i can verify unwanted spikes in my blood sugar using this product . 
had much higher hopes for this kong product . 
ride to the colossus ,  defeat it ,  rinse ,  repeat . 
one more reason not to purchase this again . 
i would have to terminate the call and then call back . 
i chalk this up to poorly optimized code . 
also ,  dont think it is as effective as gaba supplement . 
he did not know how to push it . 
the reason is that i don t like to play this game . 
thanks to all of you for your many considered opinions . 
if i didn t have big pores this might work okay . 
i have tried it for my self to see if it works . 
that said ,  it did not survive one day of light woodsball play . 
these batteries are in the original sony pack . 
so applying this morning and night is no picnic . 
though there is somewhat of a story line ,  the game is boring . 
i confused this with beef jerky ,  but it is beef steak . 
ours lost air the day after i blew it up . 
amazon . com did replace the num_extend one i bought last yr . 
i have sciatica and this cushion is for what it is titled for . 
comparing this with num_extend is really very tough . 
one of those  bad buys  that the kid will never play with . 
i don t remember the aftertaste so much in milk . 
it s basically a tear drop from a stud . 
not sure what i m going to do about this . 
unfortunately one day the spinner motor stopped working . 
the l could work for sleeping ,  but does not stay in place . 
the battery door is hard to open ,  and the screw nearly stripped . 
the same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk . 
i went to youtube to get techniques but nothing seemed to help . 
we got it out and began the process of charging it . 
we chose this model and used it to cook burgers . 
this phone has the serious problem of not enough internal storage . 
i applied the mask ,  and left it on for fifteen minutes . 
i also was shocked at how stiff and uncomfortable the ear cushions were . 
i will never buy clothing again on amazon . 
it s sturdily built yet lightweight and the perfect size . 
this double holder is way too bulky to ever carry on a belt . 
the problem described by  moondrake  is not limited to high altitudes . 
they can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour . 
i guess it is different strokes for different folks . 
they just didn t put much thought behind the rest of the design . 
perfect size for a key chain ,  but the lock doesn t function . 
i know that sunblocks are very unique for each person . 
when i purchased it in sept num_extend it was listed as  new  . 
it can be just as easily matched with duke nukem num_num for num_extend
i ended up sending the other one back too . 
while cooking bacon ,  it stuck to the pan . 
taste is ok; texture is something like straw . 
then an error code appears that there is a printhead carriage jam num_extend
i would give it a day before it would start looking bad . 
i don t understand why but the two brushes i got were terrible . 
not up to isotoner s reputation sorry to say . 
it is the worst product i ve used in that regard . 
it was so loud we could hear it inside . 
i hate fighting games with no weapons and this is no different . 
after one trip ,  the pin is coated in rust . 
the effects are hit and miss as well . 
i ended up returning it since it tastes horrible . 
i got this top to wear for barre and yoga . 
there is no vitamin a in this salmon either . 
i bought this based on the positive reviews . 
i have dry ,  processed hair that is curly . 
nothing happened the first time ,  smooth road ,  no bumps . 
the problem is the filter streaks even after you clean it . 
all in all ,  i am disappointed with this purchase . 
i had already reviewed it and received a call because of bad review . 
the song  pop goes the weezle  is barely recognizeable . 
however ,  this magnesium powder made me quite nauseated . 
the carafe does not keep the coffee warm very long . 
it was of a much thicker gauge and better built . 
as a result ,  i am dropping my  stars  down to num_extend
so i repositioned the unit and tightened all the tie downs . 
i can t tell you how disappointed i am with this kitchenaid mixer . 
i cannot tell you more because amazon won t post it . 
i used these years ago to put movies ,  pictures ,  data on . 
the texture is thicker and it smells better  :   . 
i got this for my yorkie as she has a very small mouth . 
my family tells me it tastes just like sugar . 
second ,  i use them when i work out  and sweat  . 
this unit definitely is much better in those areas . 
i got mild rope burns on my legs despite being fairly careful . 
check it out online if you do not beleive . 
the two solar panels are small num_extend each  . 
it was so cheap that i thought it was worth a try . 
more importantly ,  odor protection and wetness protection also did not last . 
according to amazon ,  i bought this back in june num_extend
i purchased these to plug into walkie talkies . 
pay a little more for a real one . 
the edamame is over dried with not much taste . 
ive descovered some good proucts over this journey . 
the blueberry flavor is extremely subtle and easily overpowered by green tea flavor . 
cm .   with no side smaller than num_num in . 
he ripped this thing to shreds not long after he got it . 
i am pretty sure i went through two if not three of these . 
if it is still bad then i will completely return it . 
i also thought i was getting a pair . 
it s actually very distracting after the novelty wears off . 
alas ,  today they no longer hold a charge . 
then i moved it to the low setting . 
i bought this to use on my daughters long straight hair . 
stuck under the landing and unable to hoist onto land . 
not the older and much better egg crate style foam cases . 
so every couple of months i ll just keep getting new machines . 
given the birds  reactions ,  i wouldn t get this one again . 
i never thought it would happen to my dogs . 
i called kodak ,  and they said it is not within spec . 
i remember this scent as a child and i love it . 
this is so loud it hurt my ears to use it . 
later ,  i thought about those little round rubber jar openers . 
every one makes you select the access point every time you use it . 
and for numbers only num_extend num_extend num_num and num_extend
i no longer have a use for it . 
i even checked the date for freshness but that was fine . 
got one from verizon on sale and no problems there . 
it was num_num boring and i just didn t like the control setup . 
it could be made differently without effecting use . 
but it has broken too many times for my tastes . 
i ordered this for my son and was fooled . 
singh ray s are the absolute best as they are glass . 
i was amazed how flimsy the internals were vs the exterior build . 
this if what i hate most about it . 
she used this and eco style olive oil gel . 
do you want us to go through a big hassle finding one . 
i liked this hair dryer at the beginning ,  it seemed fine . 
i liked choosing my favorite character and playing against all comers . 
i am back to the old fashion one . 
they dont even have all of the characters . 
the large one he just ripped apart but didn t eat the strings . 
this eye shadow base got great reviews and i m not sure why . 
one of the teacup seats does not move with ease . 
it cuts slowly and it broke in the first num_num seconds of use . 
i absolutely cannot stand when a product does not match the picture . 
however ,  today ,  num_extend will quickly prove too small . 
the replacement was accurate and was good for about num_num miles . 
when you do ,  you are forcing the camera in . 
the rubber stretches out after just a few months . 
they took one bite and never touch them again . 
i remember playing this game a few times with my friend . 
but this recent purchase has left me disappointed . 
so i m still searching for something for him . 
the game has a bad story and poor camera controls . 
after eating it her diarrhea was so watery i couldn t scoop it . 
i tried to return it but the time period had elapsed . 
it looks attractive in the picture but not as good in person . 
the overall feel of the game is very unplolished . 
and the head strap broke in the middle . 
if you choose a play ,  the replay ends . 
you can do what microsoft apparently convinced eidos to do . 
these turned out to have a short inseam . 
so i thought i would give it a try . 
this product is supposed to cut the glare and doesn t . 
the whole  paleo  thing is just selling scam . 
  and that s a kitchen mess none of us want . 
at first this product left my hair greasy . 
it is expensive and especially if you give it away . 
i purchased this from my hair dresser because she suggested it . 
tastes like tap water with a squirt of grapefruit juice added . 
sadly ,  this  and the money i spent  are headed for the trash . 
i will not be getting these for our office . 
i always seem to have difficulty completing timed puzzles . 
you can download one off the internet for free . 
when i first got this case i was really pleased with it . 
i purchased these for half the price listed here on another website . 
good thing i kept my old mouse . im sticking with logitech . 
i have no other complaints with them other than this . 
good velodyne subs cost a grand and then some . 
i even held it up to the light . 
the liter box will never be clean ,  clumps fall apart . 
it smells like a hint of chlorex and feels like dense watery liquid . 
it had the look of foam and not cake . 
i leave the fluval pads in the filter to hold the beneficial bacteria . 
bolts that fell apart !  never seen anything this badly manufactured before . 
it s just not that great for a white phone . 
this is really no different than any other nylabone other than the shape . 
i d be stretching to call them even tart . 
the first wouldn t take a charge the third time around . 
but yeah these ones didn t work for me . 
only get the blue light when connecting battery to pins num_num and num_extend
definitely ruined my sharp picture on my phone . 
its an unbelievably versatile pedal ,  and its even true bypass . 
i purchased this for a candy bowl ,  but it broke immediately . 
i saw this on sale at my local grocery store . 
i wouldn t recommend to anyone who likes a thicker bra . 
but this bt one is only just okay . 
but they broke only after a couple months . 
however ,  he s not too interested in this toy . 
i was expecting many more years of use . 
the size is good for my num_num inch waist . 
do yourself a favor and pass on this game . 
this is not a true conical burr grinder . 
they came with no problems with shipping or anything . 
using a pump should not be this hard . 
it was great until suddenly the speaker didn t work anymore . 
num_num out of num_num mysteriously stopped working at almost the same exact time . 
your opponent is there at the beginning ,  but he never moves . 
i wanted to use this as a usb charging station . 
i wonder if all of the positive reviews are by mk sales reps . 
the white paint peeled off after one day of use . 
looks cheap and cheesy inspite of the effort to make it free roaming . 
it s not  rubber  but a cheaper flexible plastic . 
not recommended at all ,  unless you just want room decor . 
i ve had no issues with that in the past . 
i did not have a good experience with my purchase . 
too thick and it sticks out too much . 
once a day just never cut it for me . 
i am sure it will work on some dogs but certainly not all . 
my old zyliss expired after years of hard use . 
i used to use clinique oil free gel for moisturizing . 
guess i will spend the $ next time for the real thing . 
pliers are not high quality ,  not aligned properly . 
it has been soupy before but not like this gray mess . 
you can achieve better results using your oven . 
the guitars do not sit very well in this stand . 
this is not doing the job i thought it would . 
i wish i would have bought my kids the original operation . 
i think the take and play series are great just not this one . 
unfortunately ,  the clock does not keep time accurately . 
why have a case if it won t stay on ?   :   . 
some of the hair had a very slight ,  strangely shaped curl . 
i bought this watch after shopping around for a new g shock . 
this is a unisex sized item which runs smaller than men s sizes . 
this game is by far the worst db game ever made . 
after all the great reviews i read here i am disappointed . 
another thing i noticed is that they are not packed with flavor . 
if you live in a warm climate ,  don t buy it . 
however ,  the bracket attached to my handlebar stem was still there . 
difficulty : the game is somewhat difficult by modern standards . 
the molle straps seem to be cut off in places . 
i ll continue my search for the perfect eye makeup remover . 
not teal  more green  like the color of the cartoon character . 
poor battery life :  this heli drains batteries very quickly . 
probably my fault for not reading some part of the description . 
fell apart num_extend day ,  is now held together with tape . 
i gamble on cheap products like this sometimes . 
i ended up throwing these in the trash after trying one . 
looked like someone had tried to hide this fact . 
i bought this for my miniature pinscher and she really loved it . 
despite the holes ,  it still holds up and fits my sv perfectly . 
im returning my set that i just recieved today . 
well ,  they sure look the same to me . 
thus it is unlikely to ever be linux compatible . 
it might be good to have around for certain reasons . 
if it was darker maybe with the glitter than that would be pretty . 
but please be warned these are absolutely terrible . 
the sides are so weak that it broke the first week . 
anyway ,  i know a little bit about sunglasses . 
i don t see that clearly mentioned from scott s ,  either . 
halo combat evolved is the most overhyped game i ve ever encountered . 
not sure what was up with this as its not my machine . 
i bought this bottle thinking that the same thing was going to happen . 
can t believe i used this for so long . 
the texture is very gummy and it does have a weird taste . 
its still usable and pretty much protects my droid . 
i used hot water and mixed up the drink . 
i bought tekken because i like one on one fighting games . 
we tried this vacuum a few times and everytime it stopped working . 
i tried both the lighter and battery connections with the car running . 
a worthy addition to any kitchen or madman s house . 
old purchased at toys r us for $
i returned it num_num more times all with the same result . 
it just wasn t worth the time or the money to return it . 
these were a big flop in my house . 
it is slick and thus difficult to hold and probably easily dropped . 
i got this from my iphone five but it did not fit . 
this proved too painful to use for my wife with her arthritis . 
i don t know why everyone loves these chips . 
was bought as a gift for a six year old . 
the little blow up toys wouldn t stay in the holes . 
at first it does a great job of building volume without clumping . 
this rice vinegar is absolutely the best salad dressing just as is . 
while i cannot explain why ,  it is worth mentioning . 
i love my foodsaver ,  but i wish i never bought these canisters . 
the top layer of fabric on this item was very cheap and thin . 
i was expecting american made quality ,  but these were cheap . 
for others ,  however ,  the game may be less enjoyable . 
the directions recommend applying the antiperspirant before bed . 
from time to time my computer said  bluetooth device not found  . 
wanted to like this bottle ,  but it has a major flaw . 
i can get it to finish by turning it back on . 
it came today and i m returning it tomorrow . 
all the moneymaking is on the console side . 
so far i have not seen any noticeable results . 
hair came out clean ,  so no worries there . 
this gift was given to my son as a gift . 
i am not a fan of this product . 
plus i was looking for a cleanser not for a moisturizer . 
the product didn t cost enough to bother with a return . 
you can t even log on without the mouse . 
didn t know shrade sold out when i orderd this one . 
you have to get this info from the phone . 
i own a previous version of this jump starter . 
i m returning due to the lack of noaa as stated . 
i like the concept ,  but this isn t the best execution . 
i had the same problem so of the other reviewers have mentioned . 
i ve tried this armband while working out at the gym . 
when i opened the box ,  the shoes were black suede again . 
save your money and go pick up one for a $ at walmart . 
could not get past the dragons in level three . 
the whole fear thing on the captives doesn t mean anything . 
did not like the fit of these shorts . 
i m on the second mission and i m bored to death . 
they have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast . 
many of the other reviews sum up the device well . 
the material is very different from the other ball . 
our dog biggie is notorious for destroying any stuffed toys . 
it doesn t get any more juice out either ,  maybe even less . 
so if it had fitted maybe i would have liked it . 
but i need to look through them ,  not just look at them . 
i stopped playing this one about ten percent into it . 
beard needs to be incredibly short for this filmy soap to work . 
the ghosts and the mansion look very creepy . 
either it works for you or it dies within a few months . 
if you have a wii ,  then you most likely have wii sports . 
tea has quite strong lemon essence smell out of the box . 
i ordered the num_num pound weights and tested it on three different scales . 
i stepped to level num_extend after using level num_num for about eight months . 
my modem and palmpilot work on the laptop but the garmin does not . 
i highly recommend the dog food advisor website when comparing brands and formulas . 
i can t believe i paid money for this . 
take my advice :  buy the commuter case instead !  . 
bought this barbie case for my daughter and am disappointed with it . 
it does not have a wire brush nor a cotton swab . 
details shall be discussed under the gameplay heading . 
but when you try to reconnect them ,  big problem . 
it s all been said so i ll just num_extend
this broke two weeks after i began to use it . 
no thanks ,  this was a clunky piece of junk . 
so no matter how you put it ,  this crap ain t working . 
the cradle is difficult to set the unit into . 
it would never protect your phone at all . 
this epilator ruined my legs for quite some time . 
i did not notice any change in how i felt physically or mentally . 
i enjoyed the chocolate mint taste and the texture was soft and chewy . 
we tried to fix it ,  but it was shot . 
this kvm switch looked like it would be just the thing i needed . 
when i first seen the graphics it was awful . 
it is painful and only execrates my post nasal drip condition . 
but the formula is too streaky for my taste . 
this chopper is just not worth the $
on top of all this it really doesn t have a strong motor . 
my take on it ,  your mileage may vary . 
there is probably something better quality out there . 
feel like i was ripped off !  this does not work . 
this goes into my top num_num of disappointing games . 
as a phone ,  good audio quality is important . 
if you have windows vista ,  it will not install . 
there are other sets which include the pad . 
please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order . 
i bought a black pair of these shorts for working out and jogging . 
that was the main purpose i bought this over the cheaper photodiox hood . 
not that it s horrible ,  it s a decent turntable . 
but i digress ,  you like it ,  you buy it . 
requested return and sending back for refund now . 
getting accurate measurements for dieting is crucial so this is unacceptable . 
they are good for that and the lids fit well . 
when i plugged it into my iphone ,  the end fell apart . 
if i could ,  i d return this thing for a full refund . 
i started to feel itchy and immediately looked for a natural remedy . 
it is now made in asia of lime silicate glass . 
anywhere else and it s too noisy to enjoy . 
i guess noise is endemic to these adapters . 
for one ,  i hate that because it just looks sloppy . 
it stunk so bad that you could smell me wherever i went . 
you cannot find any accesory pieces for this set . 
just num_num smll dose has me doubled over in pain . 
this stopped working one day after the num_num day return policy . 
overall ,  i was not thrilled with the taste of this product . 
not so !  especially if you know and love indian food . 
needless to say ,  we won t be replacing this item . 
i was hoping to hit a jackpot and have a good sample . 
however ,  only the rock songs are the good songs on here . 
my table arrived with a num_extend jagged crack in that plastic . 
it scratched everything up and then i quit trying . 
i finally broke down and rooted the phone and installed octane rom . 
not the rest of the crud that we all accumulate . 
trading migraines for intestinal troubles was not my goal . 
it is a stainless steel unit of commercial quality . 
when i stopped using this product the itchiness went away . 
i ordered the tiffen num_extend uv filter to use on a nikon num_extend num_extend
originally purchased during the second fall of law school . 
if you get a good ranking you ll be rewarded with an emblem . 
the plugs i got did not have any marking or reference to hosa . 
but when i seen this i was really upset . 
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot . 
i came from a tempered glass screen protector and opted for this . 
tried numerous usb ports and replaced the batteries . 
this is it ?  i ve played many more better than this . 
i changed my rating from num_num stars to num_extend
still stinks and off to the trash it goes . 
too bad it s too late to return it . 
we ve nicknamed them the  stinky beefs  since the smell isn t great . 
not highly reccomend it ,  iunless you have something short to plug in . 
love fiskars products but this is not a good product for my use . 
this did not change after giving her these . 
maybe if you weren t working with acrylic nails . 
but i really disliked the style of this game . 
then the fifth time ,  the tender charge light stayed red . 
i evenutally had to replace it with a different one . 
but the price was good and delivery speedy . 
i feel totally ripped off by this pathetic excuse for an expansion . 
this is my first review of a product i ve ever written . 
some of the stages were scrappy and poorly designed . 
also the graphics are no better than the gba s . 
surprisingly ,  the blade is ground to an aesthetically pleasing clip point shape . 
wandering around towns and seeing people milling about made it feel alive . 
i purchased this for my youngest daughter s first birthday . 
i think the term failure to thrive applies . 
i probably will give it to gamestop or goodwill . 
that s why i am giving it a num_num star . 
glasses are held in place just by dynamic action . 
if you have the money ,  go ahead and buy . 
i see the price is around $ which is insane . 
daylight is really dim looking on top of it all . 
i threw the stone away and bought a better ,  more expensive stone . 
he was so easy that it was laughable . 
this game right off the go has great graphics and music is ok . 
my second pregnancy and i developed bulging vein in my groin area . 
the handle is too heavy so it does not sit flat . 
the tech support people seemed as clueless as i was . 
i finally took him off the salmon food and the gas got better . 
wouldn t mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop . 
i don t plant my weight on my seat either . 
at this moment ,  i have no idea where it is . 
there were a lot of sparks ,  but nothing caught . 
so we just bought a breville and i will see how that does . 
 the issues are not due to user inexperience with consumer electronics . 
it left my hair feeling gluey and heavy . 
i thought this one would do the trick . 
not anything at all like what i expected . 
i will not continue to use this lotion . 
the leveling system was neat ,  but only superficially so . 
the same is true for when you hit someone  shooting them  . 
we had an iphone num_extend case that did the same thing . 
this helicopter was a lot of fun while it worked . 
i now understood why my husband stopped taken it . 
even in bright outdoor situations ,  the pictures were under exposed and grainy . 
i was not happy with the sound of these strings . 
the small pieces in the new england states are hard to fit . 
don t buy this ,  its not worth the $
i plugged and unplugged the hub and devices one more time ,  nothing . 
i needed to put two packets for every cup of water . 
i was surprised by the number of num_num star reviews of this product . 
num_num a pain to change the filter bags . 
my complaint however is the quality of the cardboard used . 
if you ve ever eaten diet candy you ll understand what i mean . 
i had hoped that polar meant it would be good in freezing weather . 
the one cake i tried was almost stale but still edible . 
it looks good ,  feels heavy but does a terrible job of blending . 
received this toy for my son s num_extend birthday . 
this surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size . 
and the black starts wearing off and looks horrible . 
please do not buy this !  i threw mine in the garbage . 
that is how low the sales of the num_extend are . 
i found them cumbersome ,  touchy and slow and gave them away . 
both have negative reactions like skin peeling and dryness . 
i have used olay regenerating serum for years now . 
i get grass ,  sand ,  and dirt on my phone everyday . 
i read other reviews and decided to try it . 
they would probably be okay for a kid especially for the price . 
don t waste your money ,  invest in something better made . 
even my three year old knows its fake money . 
num_extend was crisp and detailed enough for this style of game . 
it s not the model i have by htc . 
due to the unpleasant experience ,  i cannot recommend this product . 
i purchased this after reading the reviews on here . 
so i give my kid the iron drops from rugby . 
the can reads as a gigantic billboard of overzealous claims . 
they did this on purpose to annoy me . 
this product does not hold your ends down . 
i gave ths num_num starts bc i am feeling generous . 
this case is nice but not worth the money . 
i use this to help lower blood pressure . 
i bought this hoping i d be able to watch and record tv . 
this listing says medium to accommodate a num_num lb animal . 
i will never order used to save a few bucks again . 
turns out i like the old one better . 
those are absolutely awesome and worth every penny . 
when i tried the starbucks i was very impressed ,  however . 
i would look for a better quality product . 
it s like playing with cheats ,  while trying to have a challenge . 
up yours and the ship you rode on . 
fixed with glue but it got really dirty when i dropped it . 
we threw ours out after giving it a few months of use . 
this product i do not recommend for ebony skin .  :   . 
washed it out well with water and tried again . 
you d be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder . 
i do not recommend this version of braun . 
otherwise ,  these gloves are still holding up pretty well . 
let me begin by stating i love nars . 
i review form ,  function ,  ease of use ,  and construction quality . 
don t bother with this model ,  it won t last . 
the vanila was borderline ok on not being overwhelming . 
i thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away . 
we replaced the battery and the watch still does not work . 
after that it turns into a boring rts game . 
please be kind to yourself ,  avoid the hassle and purchase another brand . 
it will soon be without teeth altogether and useless . 
i am definitely returning it ,  then i will try the replacement item . 
i have to add my review to the rest . 
i looked around for any obvious issue but could not find one . 
great lace up design with hooks above the ankle num_extend
this problem is prominent when you have wep enabled . 
the graphics arn t the best and the sound sucks . 
really dull ,  really bad steel ,  ok sheath ,  poor quality firestarter . 
the bottle clearly states that the medicine must remain chilled and refrigerated . 
more than a day or two and it has a very hard time . 
that wouldn t be a problem if surviving wasn t nearly impossible . 
contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement . 
another thing ,  killing lowbies doesn t give dishonorable kill points . 
however ,  to my surprise this charger suddenly quit working the other night . 
it is a serious pesticide ,  and i will not use it . 
ran the seagate diagostic software and the drive did not pass . 
if you want something that will last ,  look elsewhere . 
i bought two ,  from different stores ,  and both failed to function . 
my friend s chihuahua could get this thing squeaking and drag it around . 
i didn t care for this coffee at all . 
the positive on this game is that it is beautifully illustrated . 
never again will buy from this company again . 
this was not enough to keep it though . 
the smell of the cat urine was as strong as ever . 
does amazon have anyone who could help me ?  . 
i ish i had the experience some other reviewers did . 
after using it ,  i feel that my skin is squeaky clean . 
the pack doesn t contain any micro fiber filter to clean the screen . 
maybe i ll give it another try with just half a capsule . 
replaytv refused to refund our money or make it right . 
either way the cats are not interested at all . 
cross your fingers when you get to the update screen . 
there was absolutely no plot in this game . 
cute enough ,  but i need the safety factor as well . 
i guess in this case ,  i got what i paid for . 
the seller took three weeks to send me the wrong color product . 
also ,  the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right . 
this boss pedal just didn t work that well for me . 
they are a lot cheaper and more reliable . 
game is a total joke and a waste of money . 
i have skinny feet and it barely fit under the strap . 
there is no eye relief built in either . 
i have had this case for about two months . 
but still going to wait for the stainless steel version . 
not sure if this makes a difference or not . 
it s just no way to keep the pet still while in this . 
i bought one to help deal with the folks at work . 
the online part of this game is really bad . 
i ve been playing strategy games for a long time . 
they taste like rather a cross between rolled oats and farina . 
it s almost painful to reach the center of the universe . 
first off ,  the photo shows  nikon  in yellow stitching . 
perhaps those with drier skin will see more effect . 
so ,  i returned it to  a local store  for a replacement . 
this stand is a huge waste of money . 
maybe if you change everyday this could work ,  otherwise . 
so even with low expectations i ended up disappointed . 
you should save your money and do the same !  . 
didnt really make a difference ,  if anything made the problem worse . 
i purchased these filter for a simple nikon num_extend lens . 
even still ,  with the clean up effort ,  don t bother . 
this case totally didn t fit my phone well . 
there is something wrong with the construction of the mouth . 
these are annoying to put on ,  annoying to wear . 
it didnt perform for me as an exfoliant . 
i don t think we even got excited about a winner . 
i needed a thermometer i could set a temperature on and an alarm . 
lasted num_num months almost to the day ,  then it died . 
i guess if you have nothing else to use that it would suffice . 
i don t know what it is ,  but my dog knows . 
i doubt i would purchase this in the future . 
my fuzzy fish simply did not like it . 
i ended up buying different shirts from kohls for my husband . 
he had to drill additional holes to line things up . 
the num_num year old is starting baseball this year . 
my cat does love this which is why it got two stars . 
the remote unit is num_num off from the probes . 
the pad i cut for the filter fell apart after a couple weeks . 
my kids break these at a rate slightly higher than the oem cables . 
what a disappointment when the blade housing cracked after less than num_num uses . 
it sucks the juice out of the batteries in no time . 
while the tuna has a great texture ,  the flavor is really bad . 
the blade is made of a cheap alloy or possibly aluminum . 
in no way do these taste like apple pie . 
they responded the plastic used is safe for human use . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
i like the small storage areas on the top . 
oxo really failed in the design of this timer . 
i ordered one thinking it would be great . 
the can has a relatively soft lid that i can easily pull off . 
other than color ,  i could detect no difference . 
graphics are nice ,  sound is fine ,  nothing special . 
i will be saving up for a real stuffer . 
moreover ,  after just a few washings the material started pilling . 
i had great hopes when i began this game . 
this was a cut idea but they suck . 
the design is good but it is one size bigger than normal size . 
i wanted something that protected my phone from scratches and smudges ,  etc . 
we bought two of these and neither worked so we had to return . 
plus it says its for a evo num_extend and num_extend
it is not worth the amount of money i paid . 
had to return  em for a couple inches shorter pair . 
the company sent me a new one and i tried again . 
the little notch on the end broke of and the head bent . 
i have one for a fan and one for rain . 
they are the same cheap bars availible at places like harbor frieght . 
my daughter tried to make these for some friends . 
this product made no difference at all for me . 
it may keep some dogs occupied but mine has no interest in it . 
i have a small bathroom with zero counter space . 
which means i never got used to the num_extend controller . 
this is the part that s caused all the problems for me . 
i m reviewing this pair because that s what i ordered . 
i ended up buying a crkt num_extend series and am much happier . 
but the grinder i received never worked quite right to begin with . 
but when that cream gets under my nose and i . 
but i have to wonder what it going on with this product . 
the space combat graphics look like they are from num_extend
i ve tried ,  and tried ,  and finally gave up . 
check other reviews before using with num_extend num_num bit . 
keep trying ,  biobag ,  you ll get it some day . 
they do keep your telephone line nice in the trunk for your area . 
i only want good quality products for my bag . 
for starters ,  the arm is just too short . 
i m returning it and ordering a second color of the other . 
if it fails ,  your gun  and scope  will fall onto the ground . 
i loved the idea of brewing directly into a thermal carafe . 
about six months ago it was the  starter kit  . 
there is a quality control probelm with these disks . 
i think these will be tossed out ,  or at least donated . 
the belt buckle is a pain as well . 
the storyline ,  dialog ,  and voice acting are all very lame . 
there are two problems that you need to be aware of . 
lantern ,  roof ,  and  icicles  fall off of cabin constantly . 
the shape of the shoe is almost rectangular . 
i would have rather played mario just once . 
i have owned midwest crates with other dogs and they have worked wonderfully . 
these will not penetrate a squirrel except maybe at close range . 
i m using windows num_num num_num bit operating system . 
i have decided to remove them and ride without mirrors . 
the product description even gives the weight but no size info . 
i was really hoping to love this product . 
after use the bow falls off of this . 
but i certainly didn t look like the model in them . 
pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help . 
one was flat  perfect  and one was warped on the edge . 
you re not saving any money buying this card . 
will not use this again and do not recommend it . 
while the quality seemed good ,  i was not impressed on the zoom . 
the sound isn t much better than tv speakers . 
it will not even fit a kindle reader in it . 
i used this as i have any other spray tanner . 
the cupcakes didn t brown as they do in metal pans . 
also the tight heavy coil cord is just too short . 
thought that a fair trial would require at least num_num bottles . 
i now rotate it into my wardrobe when i want this look . 
i tested this at first with my infrared themometer . 
oh well ,  you get what you pay for . 
what i received is not a genuine oem samsung charger or cable . 
i recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally would . 
not the biggest num_extend screen cover falls off almost immediately . 
of course it is so realistic that you can kiss your cruiserweight vs . 
unfortunately ,  this formula did absolutely nothing for me . 
the name of this product is just misleading . 
in general ,  the instructions are easy to follow . the num_extend
i found this to be a waste of money . 
my skin looked flaky ,  white ,  and smelled like sunscreen . 
num_num options seemed at top of the pack . 
when it arrived i was dismayed at what you get for this money . 
the amethyst isn t the rich purple portrayed by amazon . 
this does not sound like a turkey at all . 
terrible quality ,  no better than one from the num_num cent store . 
this causes the dish to overflow with water all over the floor . 
i have used the gentle leader brand of this for about num_num years . 
but the case wasvery rough on my phone . 
i m num_num and these strips have been around for some time now . 
within a short period of time the wheel itself came off . 
great idea but a real mess to clean up . 
very poor quality but i didn t expect much so . 
worse ,  the aftertaste lingered for several minutes . your mileage may vary . 
i bought it primarily for use at the gym . 
multiple attempts needed to get the look of having mascara on . 
he agreed to help me unpack the sofa and inspect it . 
the graphics are decent but that s about it . 
i wish that i had the luck others have had with this product . 
my daughter reached out for the ice creams first . 
it provides a much more secure way to hold your phone . 
the fingerprints are the biggest issue for me . 
i will just return this one and buy a cast iron one . 
when not supported by paper ,  the magnifier flops around . 
my mac will not recognize the dongle and the sl is spotty . 
it was okay  ,  but i expected more lather from this soap . 
also it ripped the first time i took it of my otterbox case . 
don t play this game or any of it s sequels . 
maybe it s just me ,  but this game was horrible . 
bought this and the matching pcmcia card for my laptop . 
this game was really designed more for a console than a hand held . 
i used it for over num_num weeks never missing a day . 
i love doc martens but these are so stiff and uncomfortable . 
this one looked almost the same ,  so i gave it a try . 
it doesn t really measure out like it says it does . 
as other reviewers have noted ,  the noise is pretty bad . 
it contains a lot of residue that can make you break out . 
i ll save my pennies and get a better version instead . 
she loved the pattern ,  but they hurt her foot . 
i just paid num_num dollars for this ,  including shipping . 
screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot . 
i expect impatience is likely to be the death of this particular toy . 
the penetration feeling became more and more pronounced as i tried to sleep . 
 i have waist length hair  i ll stick to my other conditioner . 
first ,  i have a num_extend mtb and it barely fits over it . 
a few other people mentioned developing acne while using the shampoo as well . 
it does not leave my hair dry ,  but soft . 
i didn t expect it to break as fast as it did . 
it will start flashing different temperature readings throughout your cooking process . 
so ,  it s back to the health store product for me . 
i had the white one and also a stainless finished one . 
i was expectcing a lightweight easy to wear garment . 
that flaw alone negates the reason i bought this . 
not sure why but would not purchase again . 
or should be ,  but not way of play . 
they held up and were really improved with the rain . 
there are several different types of cables being sold under this one listing . 
it looks like these were made for someone num_extend they will be returned . 
my suggestion is spend your money on another dreamcatcher game :  traitors gate . 
this was what i expected but more messy . 
the steak knives do ,  but the rest kind of slide around . 
not comfortable risking my droid s safety by placing it in this thing . 
first off ,  the router works fine for normal consumer use . 
my logitech ue version of the same has a much higher volume . 
it s just that it doesn t seem to really do anything . 
be warned though ,  the shoe insert is leather covered . 
do yourself a favor and buy any of the panasonic ones . 
they all have  spot  written in raised letters on them . 
the parts are kind of hard to put back together . 
i m not the first one to have this problem . 
they would not connect well or be loose so it wouldn t charge . 
shipping is $ and you will pay to return the item to them . 
many things about the archos jukebox are terrific . 
i can not distinguish the difference between signals with or without these antennas . 
may shield heat a touch better than a kitchen glove . 
had for less than num_num months and it pooped out . 
i have yet to hear back from them . 
final fantasy ix starts out as being a completely different experience . 
i can t even recommend if it would power the usb connection . 
this the second tagless fotl boxer briefs i ve ever owned . 
so now i guess i will try homeworld num_extend
as i m taking it apart again ,  it starts spinning by itself . 
i do use it ,  but i don t like it . 
i bought this to help me get my cycles back after the bcp . 
the difference in quality between num_extend and num_extend is huge . 
i bought some of this at a local sporting goods store . 
this is a very cheap piece of equipment . 
i can t believe ea thought this was a good idea . 
it has become increasingly harder to do this because of this . 
my daughter has had the same reaction to the watermelon flavor . 
you have to remove the whole thing in order to charge your phone . 
my dogs seem to prefer carpet over this . 
i figured i would be safe going with another speck product . 
i don t like it ,  won t really work for me . 
only two things separate this game from the pack ,  num_extend the score . 
the end product was very bland with an unappealing texture . 
in my brooks ghost and glycerine and honestly ,  i hate them . 
i also did not see any faster charging on my iphone num_extend vs . 
blech ,  this is not what i look for with granola . 
by this point ,  most gamers have tried the original  donkey kong  . 
they fade in and out and draw static here and there . 
i bought this for traveling to charge two phones . 
definitely no thickening effect that i can see . 
we tried three of these things before we learned that . 
it s heavy to drag out all the time . 
leaves a fuzz on pics when the flash is on . 
there is num_num of every letter in upper and lower case included . 
the cat done more of the work though . 
i didn t realize these were not sweat pants when i bought them . 
and this is my first review that i have ever done . 
so not sure why it tasted so weird . 
so right off the bat i knew i was going to return it . 
i m going to back to it right now . 
you pay more but you also get a far superior product . 
otherwise keeps things warm or cold for a long time . 
if you can find a third party one ,  go for it !  . 
this is not a good deal at all . 
wore them once and the toe has come apart . 
it stretches easily and now is practically falling off after a short time . 
these look nice but were too tight across the top . 
i called amazon and told them about it . 
i threw the whole bag in the trash . 
i ordered this for our new tile shower . 
a sickening ,  dreadful ,  terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one . 
i will stay away from sony in the future . 
i adjusted the length fairly easily ,  that s not a problem . 
seriously ,  look it up on wikipedia or elsewhere . 
who wants all that dirty water running down your face . 
i use it every day but its not for anti glare . 
total utter garbage ,  do not waste your money on these . 
proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies . 
i have gone through several of these and now have given up . 
went through bottles of the stuff with no improvement . 
i did not like this brush at all . 
i took this everyday for three months and did not lose one pound . 
i wanted one for travel and it doesn t lay flat . 
very poor engineering ,  but the sound itself is not bad at all . 
the cassette adaptor did not work in my car . 
too cheap to returnthe product ,  so i kept it . 
i ve never had a mascara flake so badly as this one . 
still ,  it makes me nervous about using it again . 
again ,  love the concept and i like it . 
i would have to agree with some of the other reviews . 
i feel bad eating these because they are not healthy at all . 
this carcinogenic goop is the best calvin klein can do ?  . 
i didn t realize it was orangish until i got home . 
it was a another fighter to add to the collection , ect . 
i will not being buying this brand again . 
i will be sticking with my regular cold coffee can beverage . 
however ,  the game tends toward the former most of the time . 
tried to wash it off and it was coming from the spoon itself . 
also the metal used is so thin it bends . 
we loved our braun electric kettle and used it several times a day . 
when i got home ,  it was completely shot . 
you must also remember to not play the game too long . 
the warranty had expired ,  so the thing got thrown in the garbage . 
save your box and receipt ,  so you can return it if needed . 
with plenty of natural light ,  we still can t see anything . 
this game made me realize how stale the fps genre is . 
how does something work num_num star level for less than a month . 
i got this for a friend who gets lots of headaches from stress . 
personally i think they are way less accurate than your finger . 
i am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader . 
i have filled it four times since hanging it up yesterday . 
i thought maybe the problem was that it needed new batteries . 
this is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted . 
one person immediately exclaimed that it smelled like cake . 
the vegetables were so mushy and tasteless ,  i just spit them out . 
you could tell it was cheaply put on by glue . 
so just wanted to up date my last review . 
i decided this brand is the one i should avoid . 
the rubber tip seems to deteriorate quickly and it gets frustrating . 
the elf makes sure you do your prayers . 
i gave it up after the first two hours . 
but it does not fit the tmo galaxy num_extend
the glue is extremely strong and difficult to remove . 
the think it stopped charging within num_num or so months . 
it just keeps spinning the disc really fast and doesn t do anything . 
the mic apparently went out and no one can hear me . 
and the wires are much thiner than my first unit . 
this product is too thin to be of any benefit . 
not only were they smaller than the brown num_extend medium i already own . 
he really was looking fwd to this gift . 
i spilled pop on it and put it on my glass bookcase . 
this makes the knife almost impossible to close with the thumb . 
the size of this hat is not meant for adult men . 
contacted the seller and was told to send it back . 
these are very healthy but the flavor is not very good at all . 
it will unstick from the black plastic part of the hook . 
i m glad i was able to return it for a full refund . 
that sounds like pride ?  insulting to all americans . 
i have been wearing reef s since num_extend specifically the ginger style . 
let us all stop patronizing companies that display this kind of attitude . 
shortly after the ear broke and will not stay where it should . 
gave it several days but to no avail . 
i also thought the straps were a little thin for my size num_extend
they ship fast and pack your stuff well . 
already at the bottom on the toy chest !  . 
there are better options out there that last longer . 
most people will probably have the same experience i originally had . 
there are other designs that are far superior to this . 
there is a loss of quality in the output images . 
it is time you start looking at your quality control . 
very disappointed in the product ,  absolutely would not recommend . 
unfortunately i can t say anything good about this set . 
simply holding the jack upside down will result in the plug falling out . 
color faded and turned brown instead of black . 
i bought it as a gift for my friend and he hates it . 
i am going to continue my search starting now . 
not even worth the minimal price that these chargers cost . 
the usb plug was not tried for fear of damage to the phone . 
i cannot believe how high a rating this game is getting . 
we purchased this because of the excellent reviews . 
plus ,  the cup size was at least two sizes too small . 
i could play the same disks on other players with no problems . 
those are the only two pros of this game . 
too bad i didn t check on amazon first . 
it smells slightly fishy and tastes like hot brown water . 
my picks fall out way too easy while i m playing live . 
the thing takes forever to get apart and is very hard to clean . 
great protection for your phone ,  at the cost of bulk and weight . 
i did not like these jeans at all and returned them . 
it just won t look as cool on your counter . 
about the only nice feature is the container . 
that is how this product is used ,  with prolonged contact with skin . 
after one cleaning ,  the plastic pan cracked in one corner . 
also when it was working it was extremely noisy anyway . 
i am not happy with it at all . 
i didn t appreciate the great little features of my west bend . 
seem to have a problem with the  offshore  quality control like many others . 
this  bread  is really dense and very ,  very dry . 
the party system is not at all like bgii . 
this is by far the worst wax i have ever bought . 
in fact it might not even cut as close as one . 
i can t recommend them for these reasons and won t purchase again . 
belkin should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a sad item . 
i gave it about num_num days and it wasn t getting any better . 
thirdly ,  my skin burns after i put it on . 
while i was on vacation   not cool  . 
it s the same even down to the map and having a safehouse . 
maybe it helps some dogs but definitely not mine . 
this cage does not hold standard sized water bottles well at all . 
it also adds significant bulk to the phone . 
poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area . 
i read the description incorrectly and it did not fit my phone . 
also didn t like the rubbery feel of the screen . 
after that the elastic stretches and string keeps getting caught . 
the kettle has always been very loud when operating . 
my fingers are long and slender  size num_extend
the comfy cone is probably a better buy . 
sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit . 
even though it makes my hair feel gross . 
they are thinner than some chino s i have . 
i don t know why but they would not stay on my feet . 
i cannot get past the main menus screen . 
onward in search of a much better machine . 
i read the reviews and those encouraged me to purchase this product . 
purchasing these ,  i was expecting dried tart cherries . 
i buy a ton from amazon ,  but this seller is overseas . 
no sound isolation  ,  very inefficient drivers and hideous sounding overall  !  . 
however ,  then i found the ingredients ,  which include aluminum . 
tried it on once and threw it in a drawer . 
junk ,  no power ,  num_extend amp per slot ,  it discharges instead . 
i ve had it with this belt clip ,  it s junk . 
i really was expecting the original ssx to be like tricky or number num_extend
i wish she would ve warned me before i bought this tape . 
i found it not fun and rather boring . 
now we ll just apply that  replacement cost  towards a  hopefully  better brand . 
they returned the phone with the same problem . 
i bought this castle for my son for christmas when he was num_extend
you have to find out what your cat likes and use that . 
wish i can use them but now just sit on my table . 
i cannot express how uncomfortable this seat was for me . 
so my son can t see the car he wants . 
one works great with my polder and is still working months later . 
i bought these six months ago and thought they were the bees knees . 
this case does not stay snapped on correctly . 
but ,  hey ,  i m already doing that with this letter . 
new lid filled withe water in a few days . 
i want it to be great ,  so badly !  . 
as far as the cannon however ,  mine hasn t fired yet . 
this is a game that you could play before playing the first one . 
when they work ,  it s a great piece of technology . 
if it had lasted longer ,  she would still be playing with it . 
the software i m using on the palm is the same . 
may just take a bit of practice to use it . 
this is now just taking up space in the toy box . 
so i bought one thinking i ll try my luck . 
the longest i ve played a single race is an hour . 
i bought this for a friend who needed this to play gta num_extend
we did not notice a difference with our dogs teeth or breath . 
yes ,  i know i can get it repaired . 
i thought it was just another exfoliating thing . 
yep ,  there was something about this coffee that just did not jive . 
i cannot recommend the tuna and noodles at all . 
i purchased this item because of price but regret it . 
the taste was ok ,  if a little bland . 
the heads came loose from the stem and would pinch your lip . 
and there is a num_num inch opening at the foot of the bag . 
i owned a num_num watt num_num qt stand mixer for num_num years . 
the cats were afraid of it and ran away when it sprayed . 
it could not fit into my cig lighter . 
right away ,  i became even more suspicious of the amazon sold makeup . 
not very realistic unless you like quail eggs . 
when the foundation was wet ,  it seemed fine . 
i rewashed her several days later not using any rinse product . 
distracting to sleep to ,  but this would be soothing during the day . 
they gave me more packets with less inside each one . 
it seems to stay longer and is less greasy over time . 
because it s not an exact mapping ,  quirks will sometimes develop . 
after about ten minutes the barking continued as usual . 
forth ,  the ramp is not as wide enough for a mastiff . 
the settings allow for all the same capabilities of the capresso . 
if you have any more complex needs this product and the company stink . 
it is lighter weight than a rubber hose ,  but not very flexible . 
i should ve read the reviews ,  as i usually do on amazon . 
the product itself should cost around $ and shipping should be less than $
not sure if that s how it is suppose to be ?  . 
i hadnt smelt this before ordering but i bought based on reviews . 
it does have num_num speak buttons put only num_num of them is english . 
not only that ,  it doesn t even taste like goji . 
i guess it depends what type of hair you have  ie . 
if you buy these buy one size smaller . 
i got this product for my mom because she has major constipation issues . 
you have to hunt through the linksys web site to find it . 
i took some benedryl and threw this product in the trash . 
i followed one of youtube instruction on replacing the battery . 
this watch uses about three batteries a year on average . 
wait for gen num_num to come out and skip this generation . 
i give this mess a num_num out of num_extend
do your research and do not believe just one document . 
i suggest purchasing this product from another seller ,  if you have to . 
i happen to like several of their supplements . 
i m still searching for the perfect sunscreen but this one is awful . 
wrestling is getting worse and the game market is following . 
a more expensive and higher quality binocular may have worked . 
i guess i shouldn t have expected much for the price i paid . 
however if you pick the apple ,  you lose all of your points . 
my puppy had it chewed in num_num minutes . 
this one was the only one that did not fit . 
this spec quickly and was in original ,  sealed packaging . 
google sugar alcohol ,  if you re not familiar with it . 
it is probably ok for num_extend beretta but not for the fnx num_extend
i don t see this toy lasting a week . 
even the windshield mount didn t stay stable for long . 
i ve been on a low carb diet and bought these . 
used other brands of dgl and this was the worse i have tried . 
the ball didn t want to snap together easily but fell apart quickly . 
i purchased this for working out and also for normal use . 
it is not practical if you shift hands . 
it gets even more complicated if you delete and add files . 
big gaping hole that you could easily see the lining through . 
we were so excited when we set this up . 
it rips throughpop cans with num_extend bbs at num_extend
it sort of works ,  but not very well . 
this seems to be a very well constructed piece of equipment . 
initially it covered well but wore off very quickly . 
got everything set up in just a few minutes ,  then . 
this game turns out to be yet another variation on the theme . 
i own this very same knife and have for many years . 
needles to say i ll be paying for it in vet bills . 
much too large even for my num_num qt pot . 
i ve broken num_num but am on my num_extend mount now . 
if you re debating between the two ,  definitely get the bluefish !  . 
a docking station means just that ,  that it triggers a docking mode . 
i used regulary for like num_num months no improvement at all . 
i returned the mixer and continue using my blender . 
this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack . 
it wore down way too quickly for the price paid . 
my keyboard is shinny and covered in grossness after one use . 
they should discontinue it on this site also !  . 
was not the right size for my lg optimus q . 
it just needs to be a little larger . 
i still have to use shea butter before applying this . 
in vice city ,  it was a drug deal gone wrong . 
it was like the arch started under my heel . 
overall ,  pass this one up and use your money on something else . 
for one ,  the sleeves barely hit my wrists . 
if you like spending money on garbage then go ahead and buy these . 
may be used it num_num times at the most . 
i am now taking metformin and clomid to conceive . 
there is nothing soft about the davinci tool . 
i sat it on something sticky and the color rubbed off . 
my wife purchased the item as a quick replacement for failed original equipment . 
unfortunately ,  i can not return it to the store . 
don t know why this is but that s the way it is . 
initially ,  you begin paying for your house by running errands for nook . 
it s very hot even with the small front vent . 
except i guess the beach of madagascar was pretty . 
 oh ,  bloating ,  oh stomach cramps and the big d  . 
i could not find a comfortable position with this item . 
the belt clip breaks off after very little use . 
this unit was intended to handle the large room . 
the animation on the commercial looks nothing like the game . 
i was excited to get these ,  because of their size . 
do you have some money to waste ?  buy this item . 
it s too small even if marked a size num_extend
i believe it came from the supplier compromised . 
the only fluff left was in the side bolsters . 
well the one i bought from bastexwireless is too small . 
num_num rifles would only fire on full auto . 
this head band arrived to my house broken in a flimsy envelope . 
the device physically ,  is relatively good for the money . 
it may not have stuffing but it certainly doesn t last very long . 
i was terribly disappointed and do not recommend throwing your money away . 
disappointed with this transaction but thankfully amazon allowed a quick refund . 
i keep trying new stuff to moisturize and maybe rejuvenate . 
get out your floor pump and inflate the tire in sixty seconds num_extend
what is titanium dioxide ?  nothing other than food coloring . 
but be prepared to be asked for a  real guitar  sooner or later . 
think i gave it away a long time ago . 
much flimsier than a quality one ,  but it works . 
this product could never have made it through the most rudimentary testing . 
the device stopped working ,  and callers couldn t hear me . 
one good thing about it is it smells good . 
the controls remind me of tomb raider i . 
espn sold better then madden ,  last year becuase num_extend
going back to my basic krups coffee grinder with new delight . 
i thought my son would enjoy this more than he does . 
num_extend of folgers instant used to do it ,  really powerful stuff . 
i bought this toy num_num minutes ago and it s already broken twice . 
one of the holes for the screws closed shut  with metal from production  . 
it is well designed and relatively well balanced . 
it doesn t feel or looks like a real leather to me . 
this cover doesn t offer any sort of cushion for front droppage . 
i used both methods to play  metroid  back in that era . 
i don t get the hype on this moisturizer . 
and don t waste your time with tech armor customer service either . 
so i returned the heater to petsmart for a refund . 
the readings were very inconsistent ,  so i had to return the item . 
i regularly use godefroy eyebrow tint ,  and i absolutely love it . 
however ,  i m open minded and gave this a try . 
the top of the old ones were smooth and of thicker plastic . 
not the edge the whole blade rolled to the side . 
my wife is a weak coffee drinker and she likes this . 
it did ,  however ,  have a significant amount of sugars in it . 
ever since then ,  it s been getting worse and less realistic . 
however i was not able to use it because they arrived in pieces . 
i wouldn t say this is a bad product . 
players good at tricks can never win a race against speed characters . 
i sent it back immediatly and got the otterbox defender series . 
these are the ones i use : cuisipro stainless steel measuring spoon set . 
my finicky daughter ,  who is learning to eat ,  likes it . 
the garnet in the middle is a pretty setting . 
if you have an num_extend setup ,  be very weary of buying it . 
prices of nicd cells plummeted as a result . 
in week num_extend they are becoming somewhat more confident . 
i rinse it out daily ,  but the rust still appears . 
it isn t as compact as i was hoping . 
this purchase was to replace an older version of this same model . 
you can even have two phones paired with it at the same time . 
no matter what i do ,  it won t unmute . 
i had a similar experience to most of the other reviewers . 
that fact alone is what made me stop playing . 
other than that ,  they are a total disappointment . 
i say wait untill the price drops to buy . p . s . 
also ,  the social structure of the whole game was murdered . 
it was a good price so it s not a huge loss . 
i finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine . 
just because water is deionized does not mean it is pure . 
i frankly was shocked to have them shrink let alone shrink an inch . 
they are so very thin that they don t last long at all . 
i bought the num_num pack on subscribe and save . 
i would suggest buying another brand of crotchless pantyhose . 
i also am very uncomfortable in high heels . 
num_extend look on the side of the carton beneath the package contents listing . 
most cereals have num_num months to num_num year shelf life . 
my son received this as a birthday gift . 
wait until it gets to $ or so bargain bin . 
the one star rating is for the company . 
buyer beware :  this is no longer the same product . 
my face became dry and cracked within the first use . 
this was one of the worst soups i ve tasted . 
even my garage door opener made them go off . 
creeps up my back and the hooks don t stay hooked that well . 
this game is my perfect justification in that respect . 
my favorite cookies ,  but never more will i order these through amazon . 
unfortunately this product did not reduce my cholesterol . 
this norpro num_num bread slicer seems like a decent product . 
i wouldn t waste my money on this again . 
this thing is the worst of both worlds . 
i just wanted to try something different .  .  . lol not recommended . 
turns out this is a lemon ,  although a pretty lemon . 
i purchased this product as i am looking for a more natural deodorant . 
there were num_num cracks in the cheap wood that is used . 
these characters only appear exclusive to one hedgehog s campaign . 
i bought a wireless netgear num_extend almost a year ago . 
it came so dull !  !  im being realistic here to . 
by the next morning ,  though ,  things were decidedly not okay . 
the oil is super oily and hard to spread . 
do not buy a heater without a temp setting . 
will be taking that to thailand and not this one . 
with that i still expected a quality product . 
had to share this ,  as i could do nothing but laugh . 
i was profoundly disappointed . it is true ,  my animal learned . 
even shifting the batteries to ensure that they properly positioned the same occurred . 
they re big ,  but not big enough for a larger head . 
i was disappointed but you get what you pay for . 
i have always had one of these to enhance my otherwise shallow bath . 
at best ,  this tastes like truck stop coffee . 
i can only describe it as chaulky and disappointing  for my taste  . 
i have used several sharpeners in the past . 
purchased another and returned it with the same results . 
i was skeptacle so i went to a local used video game store . 
this is about salton s customer service ,  not this particular grill . 
so there are two dead bodies of an identical man . 
i returned this product because the adhesives did not work . 
i contacted amazon and they were fantastic about returning the item . 
i guess hanes just isn t a quality brand . 
batman of the rings . this has got to stop . 
also the material rubs and scratches the skin not pleasant . 
so for me ,  this device is a waste of money . 
i would not order again or recommend this product . 
if you want a butt crack show buy these . 
i was so dry and itchy after using . 
crackheads are too smart to buy this game . 
this guy was dead out of the box . 
correction :  it lathers when you use quite a lot of it . 
my $ wired headphones sound better than these . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
i am planning to buy a pair just for fridays and jean days . 
would not recommend . i am mid num_extend with oily skin . 
more expensive is not always better and this chair is proof of that . 
there is no phone number on their site . 
for every fixed file ,  there was another one waiting . 
i do not recommend this product at all . 
the second thing i noticed was the graphics are pitiful . 
those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own contemptible conclusions . 
i bought this filter replacing a hoya that i had accidentally scratched . 
now before you get all mad let me explain . 
a dangerous toy and a total waste of money . 
if you did try it ,  hopefully you ll find the above helpful . 
i would rather get my vitamins through my supplements . 
a one day toy for baxter the destroyer . 
no barometer ,  altitude off by a couple thousand feet . 
i can not get this game to install . 
luckily for me this is actually quite easy . 
my cats have never had a problem with it . 
i will never buy or recommend this product . 
the other was a large rectangular size with no velcro . 
i have followed your instructions and still nothing . 
these new ones are almost shot after a season of num_num months use . 
it is tasty but not something i need or want . 
i can t honestly say it makes any difference . 
they are heavy ,  too large ,  and hurt my feet . 
i am used to the logitech marble mouse . 
i bought this num_num years ago and did not use it very much . 
amazingly popular toy ,  for a reason i can t fathom . 
i would not recommend this product to my friends . 
not this !  if you are looking for a game . 
it never had broken pieces ,  just stopped working . 
worked for about a month before i started hearing pops . 
i ordered these in the summer ,  which might have been a mistake . 
$ may not buy you the best ,  maybe just the smallest . 
i remeber when sony used to make the best electronics . 
it isn t really even enough for a two person family . 
i didn t have trouble putting this bra on . 
my original one that came with my phone still works fine . 
i won t be able to choke these down . 
i believe amazon . com should remove this cuff from the product descriptions . 
but if you like trinkets this is it . 
you cannot put a note for possible remaining numbers for any square . 
inserts for shoes are not something to buy online . 
when unplugged all my radios return to normal . 
look for another product that actually has more in it and blends better . 
you ll have a much better time for $ cheaper . 
that s where my positive review of this product ends . 
i was really looking forward to playing with this toy . 
mattress arrived with plastic hand pump ,  num_num pillows ,  and patch sticker . 
however ,  after tasting this bar ,  i m returning the other two . 
i don t think this cream is worth $
fellow cber s could not hear me when i talked to them . 
one would assume that would be the correct size . 
i bought this charger as a second charger for my ipad num_extend
found that i can t rate as didn t play it . 
beware !  this remote will keep you poor and frustrated . 
i was never able to pump a tire over num_num psi though . 
i am sad that no one liked them . 
there are chocolate chips in them ,  but they were very underwhelming . 
i will write a review on that after trying it a few times . 
it does not taste like regular sugar to me . 
there are also num_num different monsters in the game . 
instead the old block num_extend can resist all hard handles . 
the controllers themselves are larger than a num_extend or gamecube . 
so i excitedly went out and bought myself a bottle . 
think you re about to eat healthy ?  think again . 
the benefit of this system is that you directly control the heat . 
you re just paying more than $ for a small piece of metal . 
unless i am very careful to release side holders i am toast . 
made of plastic aluminum and does not rust . 
i don t understand how amazon can allow sellers to lie like this . 
belt was much larger than i expected it to be . 
i got bored after an hour and deleted it from my console . 
perhaps in time i will find the other ones . 
the speakerphone looks nice ,  and it paired very easy with my phone . 
and i just bought new brush heads too . 
i did not have a very good report for this one . 
when i first got it ,  it worked really good . 
not just the fit ,  but also the material . 
by the second day he was peeling the fur off of it . 
will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea . 
out of num_num bowls ,  num_num of them were completely smashed . 
just wait till num_extend it better be beyond good . 
my cats lost interest in this toy after the first day . 
and the fruit punch taste was simply terrible . 
we should be hard on sequels to great games . 
my larger all clad roaster doesn t seem as heavy . 
however ,  what i have is comfortable enough for most days . 
as for the cream it is very thick and a strange yellow color . 
my old mouse put the buttons closer to the front . 
they seem to have gotten bigger and there s more of them . 
i ve removed all usb devices including all host controllers ,  etc . 
obviously other dogs like it otherwise they d be out of business . 
it s like kicking field goals in ea s fb games . 
having num_num reptiles ,  we do go through bulbs . 
he followed the directions exactly let it sit for num_extend
wasn t worth the hassle to get it returned . 
he s already chewed around the edges only by carrying the ball . 
i tested the power cord ,  it was getting electricity . 
i thought that i was going to fry my dvd player . 
you ll have to purchase all new support components . 
that doesn t bode well for the early days of this mmorpg . 
we also have a first floor which is all oak flooring . 
but it snags when taking it out and ruins the style . 
try it and maybe you will but i didnt . 
the spring broke before i could clip my dog s nails . 
it is now like many other drugstore moisturizers . 
i ll be taking this game back to gamestop next chance i get . 
i have a kitchen num_extend at my summer place that works perfectly . 
my cat will have nothing to do with it . 
they even have a small hole that connects to pegs in the body . 
i was not sure that i had not caused the damage . 
this is a wonderful bra if you can wear it . 
these enzymatic chews continue to come way too small in size . 
oh man ,  this stuff just doesn t work for personal lubrication . 
this looked like a quality product at a good price . 
if it doesn t work ,  i won t order it again . 
nonetheless ,  after using as directed twice ,  i was disappointed . 
the housing is just stainless steel colored plastic . 
in this case the game isn t even nice to look at . 
the stamped  doesn t fit very well in this . 
the better option is a num_extend coiled hose which we have two of . 
it is not durable for a strong chewer . 
you don t get much for the monthly subscription fee . 
in fact ,  id even worse harm to it . 
the second ingredient is sls ,  and the first is water . 
i was hopeful this wash was going to help keep my skin clear . 
frozen fruit is apparently hard to push around . 
this stone was not able to meet my needs . 
what then is the point of buying a num_extend
but there s just no reason for the screw part on this . 
they again said they would send out new tadpoles . 
that s the only reason i gave it two stars . 
one dog kept jumping out and getting hung up on the seat belt . 
this noise is not apparent to the caller  who is using the headset  . 
i m glad i didn t pay the original price for these . 
this product came in yellow and it was to be white in color . 
they also have a great look aside from the rusting . 
in one instance ,  the bread wouldn t pop up . 
the holes in this are too small to be useful . 
my cats had little to no interest in it . 
this was too greasy and heavy for my face . 
we ll see how my toe looks next may . 
they came in a weird japanese bag with no directions . 
worst of all ,  the litter smells terrible after the cats use it . 
we ended up fishing the pasta out of it . 
even at full strength ,  straight orange oil ,  nothing . 
i am ,  however ,  extremely disappointed with this thing on most fabrics . 
otterbox has good reputation for quality cell phone cases . 
what does the little loop do and how should you position it . 
i had one of these and paid way to much for it . 
it s extremely hard to get fingerprints off too . 
many brands are irradiated  if this matters to you  . 
maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny . 
there is like this weird orange glow in the xbox version . 
and it just rode up and down all day long . 
it s up to you if you buy it . 
i taped that paste on my foot overnight for about num_num days . 
sent to klipsch for repair and they failed again num_num months later . 
i eat a lot of protein bars ,  my favorite being quest bars . 
this product could be great if you just want to mix powdered drinks . 
love the bergan soft carrier ,  but these pads were useless . 
i have to wait for someone fromthailand carry back to usa for return . 
in the year num_num you can get so many better options . 
i m asian and my hair is medium in thickness . 
however ,  my num_num month young daughter could care less about this toy . 
what a horrible waste of time and money . 
but you re a nintendo fanboy ,  you won t care any way . 
i purchased this at a local store ,  not from amazon . 
on dreamcast or num_extend if you have those systems . 
the playability on this pc version is terrible . 
the whole surface of the brush was not usable . 
so what does the game have you do ?  fight robots . 
so if you buy it ,  mind for use it lightly . 
avoid this board ,  especially with xp or num_extend
the pictures show the old style ,  black and white num_num logo . 
it is now winter and my skin is a bit dry . 
when i opened the packaging an extremely strong ,  toxic smell hit me . 
one out of every num_num % xbox num_extend break . 
on that note ,  it does seem very durable . 
i have no idea how it got so many num_num stars . 
thought i d save a few bucks and tried this . 
i lost all sense of use for this phone case . 
these do not hold up to heavy chewers . 
like the others ,  i was trying to eliminate some cables . 
i just can t use it without it burning my eyes . 
all plastic but gave off a metal vibe . 
no more class trainers and leveling up just got insanely easy . 
i only use them as an emergency spare pair . 
this was just not the one for me . 
it just didn t work as an educational toy at our house . 
and the middle where my curves are is just blah . 
but this has a bland taste with a slightly sour flavor . 
i have to say that this is my least favorite . 
they are about the size of my fist . 
i chose this rating because the product never came . 
they will fall off when you are doing moderate physical activity . 
this is essential so you can hear what you are saying . 
i was very disappointed with this product and i do not recommend it . 
additional amounts of fruit and softer flakes would make this cereal more appealing . 
the dod changed num_num times and it is now the new year . 
seems like it would work for other hair types though . 
you literally only have seconds to get that one shot off . 
i bought this case because it had a stand and the screen protector . 
i wanted an exchange ,  but i still have the old unit . 
it is a cleaver cat toy and they did enjoy it . 
because the return cost is as much as i paid for the product . 
finally started working ,  but it has slowed down the system . 
i hang the fan from num_num springs at the top of the window . 
these problems are quite annoying ,  and can make combat unnecessarily frustrating . 
it might as well be a single shooter game . 
this game is like nothing else i ve ever seen . 
in fact ,  it s loud for any room in the house . 
it is definitely more entertaining for my cat than any other toy . 
this came with a big gouge in it so i returned it . 
as a matter of fact i returned this one and got the rf . 
ten from one corner of the package were broken . 
this shampoo does not make my hair soft or smooth . 
they look like they would be a good idea and they do work . 
i didn t realize i was only getting one . 
i got half well tips and they suck . 
i disliked this game greatly for a number of reasons . 
the lace is very pretty but they won t stay up at all . 
after all ,  they are supposed to be monitors . 
my num_num week old portuguese water dog absolutely loved it . 
nothing s worse than playing a terrible game on an unsuccessful gaming system . 
using the moon dough is scary and messy . 
iv had my for over six months and im replacing it . 
if you want to play a great mob game play the godfather . 
however ,  you can t independently alter voicing or effects . 
i m a prime candidate for a product like this . 
but ,  in my opinion ,  it feels weird on my face . 
chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks . 
all three were great for a week or to . 
maybe even a little worse than those two . 
i still had thinning ,  my bald spot got bigger . 
num_extend on it ,  i don t know if that s relevant . 
this pack looked promising but it is just not workable for me . 
i use this card in my canon num_extend digital slr camera . 
they are too large to use with my num_extend player and my receiver . 
but the num_extend seemed like a good phone . 
we found that you get what you pay for . 
the only way i can eat these is by adding pieces to noodles . 
the cork insole is just smooth without a metatarsal bump . 
it s too soft and somethimes full of static . 
i have tried many base coats and this is my favorite so far . 
the smashed jar is not made by oster . 
more of a stage prop than a knife . 
this would be a great product if the zipper stayed closed . 
for a few dollars more ,  go with oxo . 
this saves space ,  cost and the need for an extra outlet . 
i remember my mom using april fresh downy when i was a child . 
by far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles . 
i sent it back and it came back with a new gasket . 
well it was quite lovely out of the box . 
i just finished building my own machine from the case up . 
this microphone didn t seem any better than the built in laptop mic . 
they need to add some variety to the scents you can create . 
they have a whole section of  not made in china  flatware . 
still searching for a good trackball that won t kill my hands . 
it was the cheapest way to pure pure delicious hawaiian spirulina . 
was a huge disappointment flavor wise the money . 
i tested this with my num_extend and num_extend
i was really excited to try this flour after so many great reviews . 
the glass turned smooth after the first use . 
the bathroom rug captures more litter than this . 
i can push it more easily because she doesn t control the steering . 
it says it fits all sizes but it does not . 
i spat it out and rinsed with fresh cold water . 
the wwe wrestling series is now worthless ,  for example . 
i feel so dumb .  .  .  . i read this label wrong . 
these cords ,  on the other hand ,  are complete garbage . 
they work great but this brand broke after num_num year . 
do not recommend  ! try grandma s old fashion instead . 
lip balms worked a num_num times better than this product . 
it s just this gray ,  dull material under the black paint chips . 
and not quite in the normal just need to be worn in spots . 
yes ,  a seller will get several hook line and sinker . 
i m back to my trusty ,  but slower ,  belkin . 
fabric is very stiff and copper color buttons look very cheap . 
as i just mentioned ,  it vibrates like mad . 
you are better off at the dollar store . 
the right size one is awful that look like cheap leather . 
china is up to its old tricks again with shoddy products . 
the serial application would not work with just any cable . 
buttttttttttt ,  it rally has done nothing for me . 
then ,  there is the problem with the butterflies themselves . 
i wish i could rate this a num_extend
waste of time and money ,  but mostly time . 
i think thats pretty ridiculous for how little of an amount you get . 
my son recieved this chair as a birthday gift . 
this is no better than the cheap walmart $ bread knives from china . 
i m very familiar with lactic acid and this one is no good . 
for some reason this hurt when i used it both times . 
i tried this product for about a month on my samoyed . 
one of the wires on the side popped off and cut my finger . 
my dogs were not impacted by it at all . 
it s too sweet and a foul funny primary scent . 
unfortunately ,  that is not the quality i was looking for . 
it is easy to turn slide etc on these . 
nice shirt but the sizing is way off . 
one for myself and one for my daugther . 
this is the cheapest most useless piece of junk ever . 
the mask worked sort of well at first . 
but my eyes only looked good for an hour or num_extend
i don t get how this this has such good review . 
what they sell now as cast iron is crap . 
the hole in the case did not line up . 
i think those things have no use at all . 
i used a pen and that worked num_extend
but ,  it s definitely better than the fm broadcast quality . 
now i have to paid my mistake beware my friends . 
indeed ,  the cut was cleaner and produced less resistance at any speed . 
they get converted to sony s proprietary  and much clunkier  format . 
there is no stucture to the material who so ever . 
i bought it at the pet store and paid $
watered down orange crush was not the taste i was going for . 
all holes filled and i have of of each part extra . 
he literally has not eaten in num_num days . 
so far so good . then came the reliability issues . 
the pole bent within hours of first use . 
again ,  he did not confirm it was tested on any vehicle . 
after first use ,  i did not see any improvement in my hair . 
some of the cutscenes weren t even fully animated . 
they are dark blue denim; definitely not black . 
everything the baby lay on could never be left out . 
its suppose to be a dress not a tube top . 
a metal switch attached to a wooden chest . 
oh well .  .  . i will definitely be sending this back . 
this thing really ruined my impression on sony . 
its uncomfortable and the velcro does not last . 
this case was a bit bulkier than expected . 
fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy . 
doesn t anyone test the items they sell in real conditions ?  . 
this game has got to have the worst graphics i have ever seen . 
nothing special ,  but i dont hate it so it gets num_num stars . 
these wax strips were next on my list . 
i keep my in the fridge to prolong the freshness . 
i have gone through so many barking collars i have lost count . 
it is very uncomfortable and very bumpy around the cup . 
the knife is made out of garbage as well . 
when you even look at the two pieces ,  it is obvious . 
i might as well direct you to the reviewer below regarding durability . 
this battery worked great the first time i used it . 
i ve had it for five years without any problem . 
after that another tine next to it bent downward . 
in the num_extend it was the teeny acoustimass surround systems . 
seriously !  he jumps and  waddles  down onto the ground . 
i verified how crooked the receiver was with a level . 
so i tried second time with less coffee and same amount of water . 
i purchased this so my husband and i could make a home gym . 
if anyone can suggest a substitute kit ,  please post it . 
some seemed to mention a bottle lasts about a month . 
my dog hears the nosie ,  very disappointing in this item . 
i had intended on this as a flashlight mount for shotgun . 
i love this color but had problems with even coverage . 
these  protectors  love smudges and the oil from your fingers . 
all the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons . 
great idea ,  but does not deliver any results . 
i am an avid coffee and espresso drinker . 
words cannot express how much i hate this game . 
i got this at academy sports for $
luckily i saved the original wipers which went back on the car asap . 
most of the time you re simply getting ready to do the thing . 
i had few sick fish in my tank . 
i hope others didn t or don t have the same reaction . 
it takes getting used to and that s even questionable . 
original headphones ,  left channel went dead within first two months . 
i used this cable for about num_num months every week or so . 
i ve bought the num_extend sticks from same company . 
shampoo hair ,  put rosemary oil in hair thoroughly focusing on the ends . 
i suggest that if you want the original back you do the same . 
i attached the connector to my faucet and the hose to the connector . 
i didn t even consider them to be pretty . 
there are num_num and there is no way to unlock more . 
additionally ,  it should be attachable to the frame or the seat post . 
spent money bought a different one and it worked great . 
selectivity was a bit below norm but ok . 
we have to start being careful about what we buy . 
now ,  i will admit that the  training buddy  is packaged very well . 
there should be an option for putting zero stars !  !  !  . 
it s perfect for travelling . the gameplay is fun and addictive . 
i recommend anyone to try a smaller size . 
will try the taylor model ,  good luck with analog taylor thermometers . 
num_extend and this newer num_extend are pure junk . 
if your iphone is black it s the perfect cover . 
it is cheaply made ,  do not waste your money !  . 
it is the only thing that has worked for me . 
it seriously removes nothing !  !  !  !  only irritates your skin . 
the cut scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good . 
these belts don t fit the size waist they are being sold as . 
this came and i was not expecting such a long thrower . 
non of this over the shoulder stuff does it for me . 
so ,  with that in mind ,  they aren t roughed up . 
i have to open the lid to check . 
increase the quantities of good items and retire all the paper boxes . 
there is a thin sharp extended piece on the bottom . 
throwing humans ,  reading their minds ,  occasionally hypnotizing them ,  zapping them . 
based on all the glowing reviews ,  i m a little perplexed . 
i haven t been able to map it to any functions . 
my results have been from % to about %
it s more greasy and sticky than cetaphil cream  which i love  . 
the handle of this produce was easy to hold . 
this first title in the series shows promise . 
amazon was very cooperative in accepting them back . 
the quality appeared to be excellent with the vinyl material being especially thick . 
i have gone back to roasting my veggies in an open pan . 
i ordered small and they are much too large . 
games are about to topple movies as the leading form of entertainment . 
the second one came and was no better than the first one . 
even then ,  i had trouble lining up the pieces . 
the graphics are admitedly great compared to most games on the nintendo system . 
very false advertising as far as we are concerned !  . 
i thought cod was just a simplistic rip off . 
my husband promptly took it to the trash can ,  where it belongs . 
normally my hair feels conditioned just after using this shampoo . 
the die is made of white plastic with colored stickers on it . 
the only useful components now are the filter and glass coffee decanter . 
i think this game si like doom with a new skin !  . 
it took three nights to get it running at a bearable noise level . 
save your money and buy a better game . 
i bought these for my cat because she loves cold things . 
at least they won t rust in the dishwasher . 
i was excited to try the mio liquid . 
first of all ,  this unit it too big and heavy . 
and i included it in a hand lotion . 
the graphics  ,  although not real impressive ,  are fine to me . 
there are many health benefits to this drink . 
just out of warranty it goes black and won t record . 
i will take more time to read all of the best reviews . 
again ,  enough junk toequal an ice cream shake or a burger . 
he barely touches it and not intrigued by this toy at all . 
the flavor is ok ,  about on par with black twizzlers really . 
i ve had this player since the day they hit the shelf . 
also ,  in my opinion ,  this is not a giggle . 
most green teas are green in color and yield a yellow brew . 
tuccini seller is good but the perfume is not . 
no easy way to report bugs either . anyway ,  reliability . 
our rabbit does not like this stuff at all . 
i got these today and they are defective . 
it would be nice to have a few recipes of cooking suggestions . 
i would be concerned of how to even properly throw this stuff away . 
read my other reviews as there is a better product . 
after a couple times though ,  the spear will break . 
for the price i paid ,  i was disappointed . 
the plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery . 
i also usually blend my food while i grab ingredients to add it . 
couple that with the medicinal flavoring and it just doesn t add up . 
the only problem is that he doesn t use them . 
coconut oil on the market but surely one of the most expensive . 
i replaced this with the comparable belkin product ,  which works perfectly . 
but this one ,  i could not even turn it on . 
even in the best condition it takes grainy photos . 
the directions were followed exactly ,  so that was not the problem . 
when i got it it turned out to be very ,  very tiny . 
my num_num month old received this as a christmas gift this year . 
seems to be the only ones working well with the cobras . 
returned both pair ,  and got credit for only one . 
it is as if we were cleaning with pure water . 
the buttons are mushy and feel poorly engineered . 
the vehicles are fun to use as well . 
this mirror starts off great but deteriorates quickly . 
it made our room feel very humid and uncomfortable . 
this whoopee cushion popped !  the joke was on us . 
it saddens me ,  as performance wise they are usually better than energizers . 
i am at chapter num_num and think i m done . 
as time went on ,  the stones wore out . 
it probaly is num_num fps but after awhile it gets less fast . 
absolutely could not get this device to work properly . 
these however will not last if you don t do your dishes daily . 
for the price of this stuff i actually expected something good . 
may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well . 
the cord isnt even that long so good luck on that . 
for the price i paid ,  i really expected an above average product . 
the fit was poor ,  leaving gaps at the top of th plate . 
overall just not a good brand for animals . 
i just got off the phone with a nice lady at neko . 
it starts slow and is so slow moving the entire game through . 
so i don t feel like i was cheated too much . 
it s the only game that does the whole thing well . 
this one was cheap ,  but very difficult to eject the disk . 
the support team was not only unhelpful but also very rude . 
with this game ,  you definately get what you pay for . 
your first mission is to fly though magical rings . 
don t absorb much more than a good quality paper towel . 
one of my three shirts is in pretty bad shape . 
the case measures num_extend square and will hold a num_extend filter . 
this is by far the worst final fantasy in my opinion . 
if you want yet another dogfight game ,  here it is . 
i think my dog likes to be able to bite down on it . 
 pretty is as pretty does ,   as the saying goes . 
if it removed anything ,  it removed the finer hair on my lip . 
the zomm only works when the cell phone is num_extend
had this on for a couple of days . 
i ordered this lens a few days ago . 
the big issue is :  it is not interactive . 
wish it had a bubble level ,  and it really needs a bag . 
the gold does not even look like gold . 
the  white  ones are really pearl or off num_extend
actually ,  this is just a sorry excuse for a game . 
i bought this things as a christmas gift for my family . 
overall ,  it took less than ten minutes for her to finish . 
it works way better than this thing ,  anyday . 
initially ,  he wanted nothing to do with it . 
i bought this on the first day it was released . 
then a neutraliser the day before i put the color in . 
the shape of the base seems to be the problem . 
i am a size num_num and this belt doesnt completely cover my midsection . 
my cold sores are rare and pop up without any tingling . 
i wish i had first checked these reviews and not wasted my money . 
this has to be the cheapest design made . 
just did not work for my poor ,  old ,  anxiety ridden dog . 
using what they call realistic settings makes flying an excercise in frustration . 
the front facing camera is one part that is partially covered by this . 
hours after application ,  it continues to feel slick and oily . 
my main gripe is that it has the most obnoxious voice imaginable . 
i ve already opened a return for this one with amazon . 
a child still has some expectationsfrom a toy . 
it is greasy ,  and it makes my skin look oily . 
the thread was waaaaay too thin for a sack that will be . 
the case fits on the phone and is loose . 
the accessories work well ,  and it is nicely intergrated with outlook . 
also several story arcs are never completed and some just make no sense . 
i returned these to amazon without any hassle . 
but the gameplay is just plain horrible in live num_extend
you cannot just let it inflate by itself . 
num_extend on the display . returned from vacation ,  sent it back . 
forget micormanage ,  forget counterunit ,  a bigger army always wins . 
after a considerable wait of several weeks i received my scan tool . 
yerba is better as hand brush without handle . 
the movement is a bit noisy too ,  which doesn t help . 
directions say to wipe off after num_num minutes; too inconvenient to me . 
i thought this concept was super cute !  hence we bought it . 
also gone are the double move spaces ,  which is sort of inexplicable . 
it was pretty cheap so i can t complain . 
cant wear it to often cause it bends very easyly . 
i tried other cards and they worked in the phone . 
there isn t any blood ,  so don t worry with that . 
very good value for the quantity ,  so i tried them . 
it looks like an original xbox game ,  or even a num_extend game . 
buy from another seller or buy another brand . 
for wet food ,  this is not a good choice . 
missing parts and parts that would not fit . 
it also didn t do anything for my acne or scars . 
not only did i not sleep ,  i literally feel ill . 
i normally do not have this issue with amazon . 
i will not give in to their less than capable work . 
you are paying for a name ,  not a quality product . 
high iron levels can lead to deadly bacterial infections . 
some products ,  for a fair review ,  need a bigger sample size . 
this is not only irritating to the dog ,  but the owner too . 
i bought both and the cusinart turned an onion into mush . 
just num_num minutes ago received this in the mail . 
the piece was obvious and it looked awful . 
sure enough ,  my lab continues to  gulp  rather than chew these kibbles . 
there was no sign of external damage and it continued to work . 
also the miracle ingredient in it is old fashioned and inexpensive glycerin . 
honestly the very first level shows how much this game is lacking . 
this brushes make my face feel dirty and gross . 
i had high hopes for this but was let down hard . 
it is unbelievable to imagine anyone liking the taste of this product . 
i think games are more fun with cheats . 
for the price i paid i would have expected better . 
the controls are also some of the worst i have ever encountered . 
this case was a little too flimbsy for me . 
it s okay ,  but not nearly what the zagg protection is . 
if the sight is left on the barrel ,  it may develop rust . 
i won t be buying again ,  not strong enough for me !  . 
better ramin can be bought for $ at the market . 
i think we played it about four times in the past year . 
i m not sure how this got so many high reviews . 
my cd player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above . 
don t let this happen to you ,  avoid bioflex . 
she kidnaps kazooie and banjo has to rescue his feathered buddy himself . 
i ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter . 
next headphones will definitely not be the triports . 
they took a good story and went off in the wrong direction . 
yet ,  there is not one legend in this game at all . 
it failed at charging even one of them at a decent rate . 
the earpads are hard to adjust to your ears . 
it performed as expected until it just stopped working months in . 
i couldn t return my copy so i sold it to some kid . 
if the chip is mounted and heat sunk correctly it can provide num_extend
compared to other remingtons ,  these just feel very flimsy . 
i bought a pair one year ago based on the good reviews . 
next time i will go with a new led model . 
i was very disappointed to say the least . 
very disappointed ,  especially for an item this expensive . 
put plainly ,  this pedometer does not work as advertised . 
this holster is not comfortable ,  and isnt made well at all . 
it doesnt have a dark tan though more of a golden tan look . 
makes a strange noise when set at certain angle . 
i ordered a num_extend for my lens and i received a num_extend cap . 
that s right ,  bouncer produces some of the most astonsing visiuls ever . 
but this does not work on my groundhog . 
this one is not convenient for a pocket carry . 
can t get this program to work with windows xp at all . 
however ,  this hard candy is way off the mark . 
i bought num_num of these for myself and my son . 
instead i would go with the mythbusters series ,  which actually work . 
they stayed tadpoles with no sign of maturing for over a month . 
wanted to like this robe ,  but it s a big disappointment . 
the reason is that they are terribly uncomfortable and unbalanced . 
i think i m going to stick with caldrea products . 
the lavender is a very pleasant ,  mild smell . 
would rather have something that tasted more strawberry ,  raspberry ,  or blueberry . 
i was able to send it back to amazon easily for a refund . 
i think i ll be replacing it with a plantronics . 
i am very disappointed in this swiffer product . 
it costs num_extend monies to wear no shoes . 
i am sorry i can not recommend this fan . 
it was a little like plastic and a little like medicine . 
has a slight stim effect ,  but not in a good way . 
in all faireness i must say that she is very ,  very picky . 
that is why the keys look so big . 
my one boy ate it twice and vomited both times . 
my go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss . 
i mixed spirulina with milk on cereal and with juice for a cocktail . 
i actually left mine on for closer to num_num minutes . 
just got this knife today from sportsman s guide . 
not sure if these are available in different sizes . 
and if u dont have that much just buy the sims . 
i could activate when she was small and now she does it herself . 
skip this one and move on to greener pastures . 
however ,  it had some annoying features that caused me to return it . 
we went back to using proin and all is well again . 
i went through num_num of these in less than num_num years . 
i contacted  customer service  to explain all the problems that i was having . 
it broke down on it s own and is a waste of money . 
this case is worthless with my motorola num_extend headset . 
for some reason i trusted it while deer hunting . 
there really isn t that much to do with it . 
i thought it seemed much too weak and watered down for my taste . 
it could work for others !  my skin could just be an exception . 
did not notice any improvement in flea control . 
i am not sure what is wrong with this curling iron . 
she simply doesn t jump the way you want her to . 
one on the east coast and one on be west coast . 
my reason for needing this is not the iphone . 
i have owned this mandoline for num_num years . 
you ll find plenty similar items for similar price from more reliable sources . 
if you need a webcam ,  do not buy this product !  . 
you re just playing the illegitimate child of a mario party game . 
yes ,  nintendo made new levels to  super mario bros . 
it s another attempt to cash in on the sim name . 
it was a bargain ,  but not that great of a bargain . 
the should was good but the head piece broke after num_num months . 
i wanted a large skillet to saute  a whole chicken in ten parts . 
i went back to play deception ,  it s much better . 
the seller did not tell everything about this phone . 
i bought this belt too big but made it work . 
the head bulky and charge time is significantly slower than other chargers . 
maybe if you re putting on a kmart nobby . 
you need someone to hold it open for you . 
many well known magazines praised this game as  good  . 
the feel of the weapon your holding is absolutely a shocker . 
if you do not have a num_extend save your money until you do . 
i absolutely love the leve style of this brand . 
this little shaver is not as good as the older panasonic ones . 
this definitely decreased the volume in my headphones . 
the case was very difficult to put on and the side clips broke . 
this is not for any chewers without supervision . 
this is kind of expensive for a simple scratching post . 
the graphics sucked ,  even with my num_extend component cable . 
my daughter received this as a gift on her first birthday . 
before i was even finished with the second eye ,  the stinging began . 
i used the original mophie juice pack with my num_extend
so now you are talking an hour+ just to install the game . 
our vet reccomends having your ferret eat a couple different foods . 
i am looking for another train for him to play with . 
there are a billion things out there that say they can help . 
to the zojirushi people if you are reading this . 
i do not understand all the praise for this game . 
there isn t a whole lot of room inside either . 
rounding out the kit is an almond roca buttercrunch toffee . 
sure the magic spells are neat ,  but most of them are useless . 
the graphics are not the best but they are not bad . 
it s too loose to hold onto the thread and just unscrews itself . 
they changed the recipe and now this has a nasty aftertaste . 
my dog is num_extend not small but it was affecting her stomach . 
the replacement came soon after and the keyboard paint seemed to last . 
the battery cap doesn t want to thread back on . 
even with the groupon ,  it cost more than this . 
i bought this for my num_num year old daughter and it s tight . 
i immediately regreted spending hard earned money on it . 
i know that different products work differently for different people . 
it is the perfect color and material feels nice . 
i tried over and over to contact them and no response . 
extremely difficult to deflate to pack away flat . 
he needed a bit more cushioning than the num_num inch memory foam . 
that earpiece would not stay in my ear . 
waste of money and not even worth returning . 
took forever to install ,  and the load times are horrendous . 
after that s gone ,  there s not much appeal to this camera . 
they were very hard ,  many stuck together and the quantity seems less . 
they don t fit well ,  and you cant wear large headphones . 
i did everything the manual advised and then tried the sony online chat . 
i bought this at cvs for $ and regret it . 
it isnt hard to make an easier and better connecting system . 
it s a little smaller but weighs about the same . 
i try to foist as much healthy food onto him that i can . 
third it loses suction at the drop of a pin . 
the michigan maple block made this particular boos board look tiny . 
i wash underware before wearing them so i can t return them . 
it was a christmas gift that did not work . 
i used the rest of the box to clean out the lint catcher . 
i returned the item and in the process of getting my refund . 
my stomach was bloated and sore the rest of the day . 
not some simple kiddie game rated t for no reason . 
however ,  i am also not a first person shooter gamer . 
a lot better quality for just a dollar or so more . 
the new num_num pound gorilla is here ,  and its name is xbox . 
you guys know i don t like to write negative reviews . 
unfortunately ,  all of our animals were terrified of the sound . 
you ll actually get more protection that way than from this ring . 
the internal ejector blade broke with the very first scoop of ice cream .

this does work just on very mild breakouts and that s it .

i put one leaf in and turned to get another . 
like some here im trying to quit smoking as well .

i myself tried it using a very small amount . 
one of the volume control buttons stopped working .

this juicer didn t cost much ,  and isn t worth much . 
i am glad there are other juicers in the world .

very small backpack ,  we had to return it . 
i have foolishly bought this exact model twice . 
same old problem with amazon sellers :  dimensions not provided . 
just that this one is a lot worse . 
obviously this one needs a little more fine tuning . 
just try any other before you waste money on lux . 
too bad i opened the package before i figured that out . 
all was satisfactory for about like a month until the chain broke off . 
i have only been using it for a few months . 
so i continue on my quest to find a replacement . 
second time i tried it bloating and stomach cramps . 
so ,  i gave it two stars for not having any fillers .

too unwieldy for my pups and they just ignore it . 
don t but this game unless your an idiot . 
it did not come with a cedar insert . 
the worst part is the stiffness of the velcro band .

low sodium kikkoman soy sauce has num_extend per serving . 
i like ginger just not this much in one drink .

without the protection ,  i doubt that the beneficial effects are being realized . 
i would classify this as a piece of junk . 
i have had three hoover carpet cleaners and shampooers . 
bought them one more time with the same bad results . 
purple ,  not maroon in any sense of the word . 
then after my search for brown athletic mary janes i became sadder . 
it is also light and easy to use . 
i found premier to be a very stable and easy to use program . 
i think that you might be better off using regular hair dye .

i even called customer service thinking something was wrong with it . 
try to avoid memorex media as much as you can . 
it never occurred to me that the markers were not washable . 
i have to say though ,  i was disappointed after trying it . 
it is just too strong though i diluted it . 
they have a strong red tone and nothing like the picture . 
my shure earphones sounded like claws on blackboard . 
so the panties are pretty much useless now .

this led to alot of cheap deaths throughout . 
at first ,  this cable did what it said . 
i ve never had this problem with oem parts . 
this item is very sharp and built with good materials . 
if not ,  you can find a lot better head stands . 
ha !  guess i m not as clever as my dogs . 
if it works at all ,  it tortures the poor mouse victim .

it should just be called a water bed for dogs . 
i ve bought two of these ,  and both have gone bad . 
she said that last year a product i had worked much better . 
i don t this this is one of there better flavors . 
the toy itself is not child durable that s for sure . 
it can clog pores to the point of causing blackheads and acne .

one down ,  seventeen tea bags left to go . 
the cheek pad sent was not the product pictured . 
this certainly was not for us  my wife and i  . 
the sound was pretty decent ,  but never stayed in my ears . 
it needs to provide more fine control over the different volume settings . 
if i had known ,  i would have avoided it . 
i want to see them in person before i purchase more . 
i have worn the skin off my hands trying to clean it . 
worked with my two macbooks but not my dell laptop . 
i have no complaint about it ,  just wonder why i ordered it . 
the indents are deep enough so the design always transfers which is good . 
love melissa and doug ,  but not happy with this shape sorter . 
i use it for a scrub brush for cleaning . 
comfortably sitting in my seat ,  nothing but static . 
had trouble getting it to glow and gave up . 
oh by the way the vendor does not provide refunds . 
then again ,  it doesn t really have any taste . 
unfortunately ,  they sent me the lamb and rice roll instead . 
i don t widen the hole to make putting easier . 
i m on my third in a year s time . 
overall ,  it is very sturdy and super cute . 
just be warned for any other persons interested in using this product . 
it s loaded with caffeine and not much else . 
gave this to goodwill and bought a different style brush that works great . 
i can t find a reliable digital one on amazon at all . 
i would not recommend it to anyone unfortunately . 
i found this move almost impossible to pull off though . 
the problem i have is the circle part is too big . 
it just hasn t held up well over the years . 
will donate them somewhere where they can be used . 
the plug doesn t even have a ground pole . 
think back the fall of num_num when  the blair witch project  was released . 
but i guess you get what you paid for . 
neither would stay connected to our honda odyssey . 
i decided to lend a hand and found that it was very difficult .

i even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review . 
a small cylinder airstone works better than this does . 
i was diagnosed with cll  leukemia  in the latter half of num_extend
it s a cheap camera and the image quality reflects it . 
again ,  a less stiff button would go along way to fixing that . 
if you want the panty style ,  these are not them . 
they taste okay ,  but my homemade ones are much better . 
i purchased this socket tool ,  becouse i had to . 
i worry he ll scratch our wood floors with it . 
the microsoft rapeage is getting a little rediculous . 
if you like the sound of am radio ,  buy this unit . 
indoor pictures ,  even with lights on ,  are very grainy . 
simply put ,  they need better material to hold this together . 
i will have to remove the polish entirely tonight . 
they are tight so not too comfortable to wear for long periods . 
only num_num of the num_num pieces is as pictured . 
my foot runs betweena d and e width . 
it is meant to work to keep dogs in the backseats of cars .

knowing nothing about it ,  i decided to buy it for her . 
i fired off an email to stash already . 
i have purchased several different brands from several stores . 
the distortion was harsh ,  thin ,  artificial sounding and always noisy . 
i believe this cord will not break at the connections like the rest . 
it s going out with the trash on next pick up . 
seems like a quality product but i had problems with it . 
i was very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews . 
so its only good for a few time . 
like most people ,  i don t much care for being lied to . 
if i could give it negative stars ,  i would . 
the box and both bags were full of ants . 
overall ,  the product is poorly executed and not worth buying . 
it tends to squirt out all around you . 
my opinion is that this game is not worth purchasing . 
i have to watch what i put on them . 
the touch screen is overly sensitive and gets smudged easily . 
well ,  this conditioner does not do that at all . 
i searched and searched ,  then realized it was hot chocolate . 
today ,  i washed it again and decided to give it a try . 
i gave up after waiting a long time on hold . 
you are running around like a lunatic with no substancial goal to achieve . 
cleaned every part that can cause problems and still the same . 
thankfully ,  customer service was excellent and i was refunded for the product . 
the led actuation is rather inconsistent with this laser sight . 
a search through the available grind and brew models today offers very little . 
there was no sound because the battery was dead . 
when jobs do go through they are agonizingly slow . 
i am a big fan know screen protectors . 
i used this as secondary unit for my bedroom . 
very loud when it is on the high setting . 
there was a great selection but missing the natural feel . 
num_extend and this time ,  red ones ,  which are neat . 
i think this is just a symptom of the design . 
i will never buy from this company again . 
before you know it ,  you ve already died num_num times . 
i purchased this toy for christmas also but was very disappointed . 
i think it s time for a switch to another brand . 
i had it on num_extend and the thermometer showed the temp was num_extend
not long enough in the inseam and too loose in the back . 
this stuff will leave you with an orange glow . 
the original one worked well but the replacements doom the stylus to retirement . 
okay only if you are in love with crayons . 
schizm is a beautiful game ,  but not without its problems . 
and you will see how lame and outdated this game model is . 
you can t get tattoos ,  or increase your fighting ability . 
i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game . 
i felt great about this product ,  but not anymore . 
leave the snack bars to clif energy bars and other companies . 
varied gameplay ,  no chance . what a waste of time . 
my son ended up playing with it more than her . 
i ve had my microcell for a year now . 
everything sounds kind of muffled and it makes conversations difficult to understand . 
but two days later the buzzing noise is back . 
several tests convinced me i had a defective scope . 
it just simply did not work for me . 
they randomly make noises  even when no one in is the room  . 
also ,  i had xp related problems  as did a few others  . 
even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables . 
it s the worst rpg i have ever played . 
the ingredients are actually pretty good as is the nutritional profile . 
it is a real shame i won t enjoy this one . 
cheap plastic ,  the jewels will fall off easily . 
the colors are not what you see in the picture . 
all the problems that plague bad num_extend person adventure games are here . 
it was strong and had a terrible after taste . 
my num_extend pound puppy chewed this into pieces within num_num minutes . 
the quality control guy must have been zonked .   .  .  .  mike . 
it gets a little annoying and a hassle after awhile . 
the jar assembly does not align correctly with the motor base . 
plus the maximum volume isn t very loud at all . 
basially you just stand there and exchange blows until someone falls . 
the resulting picture always come out somewhat fuzzy and color is weird . 
this system with which i used this tray was a disappointment to me . 
i also like the fact that it comes in several different colors . 
when my kids actually sat down and used these correctly they worked fine . 
first of all ,  it s cheap plastic and made in china . 
but i can t make this stylus work to save my life . 
i followed the sizing guidelines ,  and ordered a size large . 
you will harm your guinea if you buy this for them . 
wanted num_extend but amazon s doesn t do one for polorized plugs . 
nobody on apple s discussion site have had success . 
if you press them on your screen ,  they smoosh completely flat . 
there is no comparison between the quality of the two . 
i was hoping it would be more versatile ,  but it is not . 
it is playable without them ,  but extraordinarily difficult . 
this is what i affectionately call a  clicker  game . 
the leather is not high end leather looks closer to plastic than leather . 
this laptop is a big disappointment for me . 
this is by far the worst camera i have ever purchased . 
i did and they sent me the wrong parts . bsn . 
you have to hold onto it otherwise you will tear your carpet . 
i could not wear it out because it looked ridiculous . 
as the other reviewer said ,  the fruit stays lumpy . 
i bought num_extend and they are not even uniform . 
i don t know . we finally caved and bought the litterrobot . 
i have never had one sound so bad . 
this had high reviews in a magazine i read . 
if you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere . 
will probably use the bandana without ice pack as bandanas for the dogs . 
put them in a submission num_num times in a row and you ve num_extend
i always got an  unable to connect to device  error . 
after a year it won t hold a charge . 
get killed and you lose all your power ups . 
overall ,  a very poor design in my view . 
the only way i see it works is to remove bikes rear axle . 
there is just too much text in this game . 
the same with all philosophy fragrances and products . 
the product shipped did not appear to a tripp lite cable . 
material is rough and uncomfortable and never stays inflated . 
another overpriced item from the miss jessie s collection . 
i would never buy another bp monitor with such a cuff . 
this game tried to be like grand theft auto ,  but failed miserably . 
he will go without eating for three days if necessary . 
i was a huge fan of the invisibleshield for iphone num_num series phones . 
never had a burning smell or funny noise . 
after using this french press ,  it is a joke . 
this blackhead remover did not work for me . 
this came up for a search for large hepa filter . 
as another poster mentioned my eyelashes don t hold curl with this either . 
this brushes are not even better than good . 
they sound bad and don t stay in your ear . 
chicken is listed as the first ingredient ,  followed by soybean meal . 
but visibility is very poor in most situations . 
the media compartments are flimsy and sluggish in response . 
i bought two of these about a year ago . 
all the pieces fall to the bottom and out the sides . 
i cooked num_num cakes in this pan none turned out . 
i purchased this for a friend and now i lost that friend . 
at first glance this seems like such a great product . 
so much oil that the brownies were like being fried . 
yes many nausea products rely on sugars to soothe the stomach . 
the problem occurs almost every time i shutdown the pc . 
i then turned the sound on and it was horrible . 
i am disappointed in the size of these . 
a bigger mistake is the endless  sameness  of the enemies and the levels . 
but i like south park ,  and i hated it . 
as a whole this wallet felt very flimsy . 
purchased this as a friend ranted and raved about it . 
maybe there just isn t anything to reduce the effect of urine . 
although i like how it is small and fits nice in my ear . 
i see another reviewer had the same problem . 
the graphics are a little dated now num_extend but not brutally so . 
i liked the noodles though but not even noodles can save this soup . 
highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise . 
it didn t look like it was gonna work . 
you try not to hurt them in the first place . 
the stock buds that came with my ipod provide much better sound quality . 
this is an attractive set when new and the grinder works well . 
i then noticed it had a completely different taste . 
it really made no sense the animals were wrong . 
to me it was just big pieces of chocolate and nothing more . 
in my opinion this is not a quality product . 
it also started to get an off taste . 
i was a faithful customer ,  but will no longer buy this product . 
once the avatar was created ,  the progression was boring . 
its a shame jaybird blew it with these . 
it s too small . buy two of these pants size num_extend
i bought this because of it s relatively low price . 
this review may sound like i have a lot of hostility towards microsoft . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
it does nothing to my scar ,  and worsen my pimples . 
far more than i expected for a plug in . 
save your money for a game or some fast food lunches . 
i only got one ,  thought it was num_extend
it s kind of like a mixture of clay and chalk . 
whoever wrote a good review about this product lied . 
returned this item since it looked very in attractive on me . 
i ended up using a liquid ammonia lock instead . 
irritating  music  you can t turn off  it keeps coming back  . 
until the first use and it fell off . 
two weeks later ,  the other handle broke off . 
but i still missedthe num_num dollars i spent on fedex shipping . 
it takes num_num batteries and it is like a game . 
doesn t charge or hold a charge or turn on . 
the smell was a cross between petroleum and rotten grapes . 
this one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related . 
this watch it tiny and feels like really cheap plastic . 
i have the same problem as other users since pretty much the start . 
these speakers do not sound bad ,  don t get me wrong . 
doesn t say any real words for the penguine . 
it s so convenient to store with the airtight cap . 
therefore ,  it does not match my other  real  wood watch boxes . 
now ,  i find that flat irons work best to straighten my hair . 
i hope you all think twice before ordering this reader . 
i didn t see any improvement what so ever . 
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store . 
you then should clean it and simply put it back . 
i kept pushing it up ,  but it kept coming down . 
kitchenaid offered to sell me a new one at a discount . 
it is however very small like a quarter and quite cute . 
have received a rma so appears seller acting in good faith . 
oh ,  pooh ,  and i only used about num_num times . 
my nephews enjoyed this for two weeks until they broke it . 
num_num stars for the taste and nothing else . 
i feel like i am stressing the phone ports as i insert it . 
i ve had mine for num_extend now ,  and never had an issue . 
it was winter with snow on the ground . 
this item works as promised ,  for the most part . 
it is like a normal bra and will be used as such . 
perhaps  we  need lotion that actually absorbs into the skin . 
filling bird seed is impossible without spilling seeds everywhere . 
i waited three months to give this product a fair shot . 
not quite a grand simulation . other things annoyed me . 
it never really impressed me as far as the perceived quality went . 
out of the three powders i bought ,  i ended up with maybelline . 
i hope i find one before i run out of wires . 
even a dollar store product has more flavor than this does . 
check my other review on the other brand . 
i have a samsung galaxy num_extend and nexus num_num crazzy . 
this so definitely is no longer a trustworthy product . 
but i knew that by reading the other reviews on here . 
but ,  somehow ,  i ended up buying this model . 
i wish one could get more info on products prior to purchasing . 
i would have returned it but she d be heartbroken . 
not very useful at all . the fabric is very thin nylon . 
i will probably keep the retractable cable and toss the chargers . 
sorry fender .  .  . this one is just a waste of money . 
on a bookshelf it sits crooked because the bottom is crooked . 
i finally decided i needed to get a new pair and ordered these . 
now i have to go through the return process . 
they sent another but it arrived the same way ,  separated and watery . 
however ,  i would never buy another blue tooth off the jawbone brand . 
it has scratch marks all over it and looks very very bad . 
the taste is somewhat cardboard like with a sort of metallic finish . 
i put it on with brushes on my face . 
i ve bought two of these ,  a year apart . 
this is definitely for a kid num_num or preferably higher . 
it s sad because it was so exciting when we got it . 
had to return the num_num petite and order the num_num short . 
i mean he should be an end guy it s so stupid . 
when they re ready ,  you can attack your opponent and their cards . 
as pictured but doesn t look right somehow; the stone is very pale . 
it also made my eyes burn at times . 
i found that the brush didn t rotate anymore . 
i thought this might be a good game . 
everything about the game is annoying and confusing . 
i have used tiffen for years but this is just plain junk . 
i urge others to consider the same option . 
i m not sure if i got the same hat everyone else did . 
this was confirmed when i put my foot inside . 
i will check back to see if any changes were made . 
here s a game for which i had high expectations . 
there was a spiderman before this and the controls were pretty bad . 
i m going to have to get the damaged portions cut out . 
i wish it had silicone but no ,  latex . 
i am hoping i can find an adapter . 
this product does not allow me to do that . 
it doesn t seem very heavy duty ,  simply translucent blue lightweight plastic . 
i purchased this exact same set num_num years ago and loved it . 
i just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh . 
this is the third pair i have had . 
i read all the reviews for this cat tree before buying it . 
but you won t really be able to do that too much . 
there is a lot of hiss in the sound output . 
i requested a replacement order when the first order arrived in pieces . 
it dried out my face quite a bit . 
i can not say for sure if it will work or not . 
i like netgear equipment but can t recommend this adapter . 
this was my first attempt at trying this kind of tea . 
other pet owners we know are having the same problem . 
when each time i was in my vehicle . 
i bought this for a white elephant gift . 
this thing is a piece of junk and doesn t clean anything . 
after i ve concealed certain areas i use my fingers for the rest . 
i didn t realize this was for an iphone num_extend
i was looking for a great organic e . v . 
i wish i would ve returned this toaster immediately . 
nowhere on the product itself does it say what battery size it uses . 
when it is stale jbm coffee tastes stale . 
i bought this knife for myself and my sister . 
on the down side ,  game play is sluggish ,  at best . 
although a lot of people liked this game i hated it . 
there are marks and dents in the battery . 
my salon quit carrying this line and i was really disappointed . 
i doubt the effectiveness of a soapless damp cloth on cooking oil residue . 
if the radar is over a hill its near zero . 
in the package of num_num i had ,  % of them were burnt . 
trigger didn t work at all out of the box . 
my sun damaged skin once again reared its ugly head . 
i would never recommend this product at all . 
this game isn t worth what you have to pay for it . 
it looks like something from the dollar store . 
i am kind of dissapointed with buck on this one . 
he went nuts ,  so ,  i purchased more greenies . 
this blend is very weak even on the smallest cup size . 
didn t expect better fm reception nor did i get it . 
i figured i d give these relatively inexpensive sony s a try . 
the air hogs sharpshooter is a lot of fun to fly . 
the problem is with the grip and spring mechanism . 
i kept putting it back together hoping i had fixed it . 
the car wash vacuum or a standard vacuum cleaner would suffice . 
you can t operate two teams or even control your squad . 
imagine that you ve spent several hours working towards the denouement . 
now they don t reply to any more emails . 
i ve been trying out different dry shampoos to find one i liked . 
apparently the closure it simply not secure enough . 
gets two starts cause i still love cold steel . 
save your money and buy a better knife . 
i ve purchased it before and really liked it . 
obviously there was something wrong with the optics . 
it is not a good investment and it will just break on you . 
the drink itself was way too powerful for me to drink . 
the second one only gave audio out of one side . 
but i wish that i didn t get a crappy product . 
looking at the ingredients prune puree is listed before the peanut butter . 
the right one failed failed in the num_extend month . 
i tried a few types of oil with the same issue . 
i do not feel they are safe imo . 
will not be purchasing these from  cosmetics central  again . 
i have been big up top since i was num_extend
i love peas but bottom line ,  the peas alone tasted dry . 
you do get what you pay for in terms of makeup brushes . 
i purchased this to help hide the redness in my face . 
some people may prefer a mild blend ,  but this is just weak . 
right away i knew it was a bad decision . 
when i put the oem battery back in ,  problems go away . 
i gave this to my cat religiously in hopes of helping her arthritis . 
i thought i found an  adequate  one and bought the maverick . 
the case broke after a few months and i threw it away . 
the full spectrum light is nice and bright . 
the case does not look like the clasps will last very long . 
it s a beautiful piece but it s very small . 
oh ,  and also ,  it is not a very good consistency . 
this is on  superman num_extend levels of horrendous . 
i have used this bag on several hikes . 
i pretty much traded it out within a couple of weeks . 
you d think new york city is populated by % felons . 
going to be disappearing to the world of craigslist very soon . 
third time used num_num scoops for num_num cup of coffee . 
you get what you pay for and it s total bupkis . 
sure i love the taste of the sugary sweetness of this cereal . 
id the microphone and be done with it . 
needed more for the price and size of container . 
what a shame ! my advice bought it the old fashion way . 
at first was very disappointed with the sound . 
this bra does not lie as flat as i d like . 
went with the park universal tool that has both plungers . 
the cord is generic and doesn t plug into the usb socket fully . 
they re so bad i m throwing them out instead of eating them . 
i suspect that the antenna system is bleeding lots of rf . 
it s plain unimaginable to me that anyone could like these . 
one thing that this shaving cream is superb at is . 
the item i purchased was num_num dozen of the polka dot balls num_extend
the whine though was just to much to tolerate for a $ product . 
this case gives abosolutly no protection from falls and drops . 
laptop speed ,  performance and battery life improved while using the chill pad . 
worse ,  it was sent without all the support poles . 
i had it about a month now and i used it about num_extend
the announcer makes incorrect comments during the fight . 
bad design ,  and it makes crunching noises when you walk . 
this one wouldn t work on my phone or tablet . 
this tire is falling apart after only a few months on a trainer . 
remove it from your cart immediately if you value your sanity !  . 
also it s an invisible mist ,  so you do not see it . 
i m not quite sure what the heck it is . 
i shortly donated it to a thrift store . 
just for interest ,  i compared the game play with world of warcraft . 
you have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock . 
no need to sync with your pc or mac . 
i m buying myself a new curling iron with a clamp asap . 
of course ,  it doesn t have an excuse to be anything otherwise . 
however ,  when i rode back ,  pain started at my hip bones . 
if you have played good shooting games this is not for you . 
for such a simple design they shouldnt have these kinds of problems . 
i ordered two of these from the oem for cheap seller . 
so buying another seat for her ,  wasn t a big priority . 
one makes noise when the  little person  is pushed down onto it . 
after installing this splitter i had problems with my tv hdtv reception . 
two of the first four ingredients for marshal s are fish . 
i bought this volume control for sports activities . 
single player mode can have two extreems ,  easy or hard . 
also ,  the nylabones stand up to her as well . 
the num_extend has two places to plug things in . 
i wish that i had seen the reviews before buying this one . 
they never emailed me back and i got sick of being on hold . 
bought a num_extend and a num_extend both the same . 
later that day the whole thing starts to fall off . 
i bought this game thinking it would be good . 
this was the third of the fountains we purchased that were plastic . 
i also ordered the matching batterey holder too . 
sony gives you a one year warranty on the product . 
this has a great fresh scent but it s too drying . 
also the cardboard sheds a lot ,  more so than higher quality scratchers . 
the software has a somewhat unfinished feel to it . 
but it works well as kind of an amuse bouche for a game . 
when the ups man delivered this the motor was running . 
i saw all these great reviews and raves by youtube gurus . 
i will be throwing it in the trash . 
i would never pay $ for this chair . 
once again ,  i was able to pull in several dozen stations . 
the idea of adjustable straps to create a custom fit is great . 
somedays i use it twice ,  some days i used it three times . 
i bought the breville num_num jexl after owning a jack la lanne juicer . 
these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff . 
these are snug ,  but think they will stretch . 
i do not generally have problems taking pills . 
this felt cheap and herd from others the shells fall out . 
after two days it stopped working and just completely froze . 
this is fun and it works pretty well . 
now they re cheapening things throughout their product line . 
the camera is durable but my daughter only used it once . 
also the worst nightware is the inclusion of stealth unnecessarily inside the game . 
the tape player rejects it and the stereo display shows  broken tape  . 
some parts of your steak are saltier than others . 
honestly ,  i was expecting more flavor and less sand . 
this product should be sent back to the design team . 
i made delicious oven fried chicken in it . 
this sounds easy ,  but in reality ,  it s anything but . 
for some reason ,  htc didn t properly implement that feature . 
i ve used this num_extend and each time i charged the unit fully . 
he does like trains ,  but doesn t really consider this a train . 
works well but the top is not so easy to use . 
and in a few weeks ,  things indeed did begin to sprout . 
do research before you buy any card this price . 
when i received it the pen wouldn t twist up . 
i wish they would print that advice on the packaging . 
oh well ,  hopefully they will get right this time . 
these look much better in person than the picture suggests . 
i couldn t walk for than num_num feet away without awful interruption . 
i could not believe this  deluxe  version was so poorly made . 
otherwise ,  the product appears to be as advertised . 
you cannot exceed it since it has no degrees of compliance . 
it hasn t been any better than plain water at cleaning for me . 
i do worry about my daughter s hearing when she plays with it . 
the graphics are very dated and the animation isn t terribly smooth . 
i m actually really mad that i wasted money on this . 
i had similar problems with my headphones falling out when i ran . 
i picked it up from its straps and it tears immediately . 
sorry dubble bubble ,  however i did not like this product at all . 
if it was foolproof then yes ,  but it s not . 
contrary to what other reviewers have stated ,  the the product is oily . 
i had a very hard time getting into this game . 
it absolutely did not have any chili flavor whatsoever . 
i bought the spray along with it and it didn t work either . 
i ve given up on this product and plan to go with logitech . 
i bought this for a busy restroom at work . 
i can get as far as installing it . 
i saw the swatch for this and fell so in love with it . 
many better ,  more natural looking options available these days . 
i m sorry i didn t just buy a real tank from day num_extend
i thought this hormel s compleats beef pot roast was just awful . 
the cinnamon and cloves flavor is nowhere near what it used to be . 
probably great for espresso ,  but not for a french press . 
i bought num_num of these and within a month num_num have broken clips . 
this item is not created with rhinestones or any stone at all . 
some tasted stale even though they were  barely  in date . 
i was cleaning out a closet and found them all . 
it got to the point that i just gave up . 
the look is better quality than the speaker . 
there is nothing magnetic about either the fishing pole or the puzzle pieces . 
they looked dark and gray and not much sparkle . 
the light is a ridiculous gimmick that eats batteries . 
i received a poorly packed set ,  spilled out of the case . 
i ve had much better luck with my two num_extend stealth fans . 
my cats have no interest in this at all . 
the first five disks i tried didn t work . 
third ,  the game wont run on my geforceddr under direct num_extend
the num_num pack of num_extend is now num_extend
check . you see ,  this is basically a continuation of resident evil num_extend
my daughter repeated  blue foot ,   and i had to correct num_extend
the foil blade covers were very fragile and difficult to install . 
i was very excited to finally get my zoji . 
i was hoping for a good experience ,  but was dissapointed . 
i gave the command to  leave it  and then pressed the  sound button  . 
it drapes nicely about the head and shoulders . 
i ll be honest; my problem with this product could be my fault . 
although this product carries your ds games nicely . 
sorry but i will not be using this product again . 
i wish it had a rechargeable ,  internal battery . 
it s as though the spout is designed to create a spill . 
they were pretty ,  but i was shocked by how tiny they were . 
broke the first time i try to change it . 
curiously absent is `die anna  and her car . 
both of them have now failed and are no longer working . 
the phone case held the edges down fairly well . 
same thing happened ,  even though i used more the second time . 
quality is poor ,  they are a bit flimsy . 
the boxes i received in the mail are not labeled as such . 
make sure that you get the cable sold by amazon . 
the price is fair for what you get . 
i realized that all vines are not created equally . 
just turn inside edge off and use your own common sense instead . 
i m very happy i did not put this on my car . 
i had high hopes of this being a product my cats would like . 
however ,  with continued use ,  the camera simply doesn t perform . 
it wasn t until later that i saw a pattern . 
num_num of the num_num snap caps is slightly out of spec . 
this doesn t happen every so often .  .  . this happens frequently . 
it has a flashing light ,  which she liked a great deal . 
i like most of you tried bare minerals after seeing glowing infomercials . 
i kept this unit because is still works with other usb devices . 
it made my hair dry and desperately num_extend
i had to return it and get a different one . 
do not buy this to extend the wireless range inside your house . 
remember to follow the age suggestions when in doubt ,  that helps . 
i bought this thing about a year ago and it worked pretty well . 
i have played every call of duty game out there . 
the quality is ok and the bats fit in well . 
for some reason this was not working right from the packaging . 
companies like this should not be in business in america . 
the slightest movement produced smearing and broken images . 
these type just keep falling off of my big feet . 
that is why i think its a total waste of money . 
sometimes the game locks up my hefty system . 
then it rusted when we went to wash it . 
finally ,  the condensation has  blanked out  the clock on two separate occasions . 
i have used many screen protectors in the past from  bodyguardz  and  skinomi  . 
we take it backpacking and no one seems to complain . 
it was fun to spin it around and maneuver it around obstacles . 
there is good coverage of the powder coating on the metal . 
biggest piece of crap charger ive ever owned . 
but the terk user manual gives almost no information . 
they kind of remind me of plain scones with a lack of flavor . 
the volume button became extremely hard to move . 
the various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options . 
we set the board up and make up our own game . 
this time i am not happy with the purchase . 
save your money and avoid being a dupe like me . 
still on the search for a good humidifier !  . 
i just wish the heat was at least warm . 
it s been a couple of weeks ,  and still no enema bags . 
for the occasional snowstorm in your driveway maybe . 
they are comfortable with a great design ,  but not worth the money . 
nothing else would be able to fit inside that purse . 
maybe the wen is doing all of this for me already . 
much happier with the basic model as it works great and is lighter . 
i haven t been able to get these to work at all . 
i iron quite a bit because i sew quit a bit . 
i trust sony products ,  but this one let me down . 
it was less noticeable when using my pentax kr . 
with the amazon discount ,  it s just about worth the price . 
the lightest touch makes the puppy start singing or talking . 
it already looks dingy after num_num days ,  unfortunately . 
i use windows xp and this product is awesome . 
i don t know how effective it is ,  but it smells awful . 
but it very disappointed me with bad smell . 
it was a simple pvc plug with a recessed fitting . 
not everything promised ,  easily bends and losses bristles ,  not long enough . 
i do not recommend buying this at all . 
the sizing is incorrect and the quality is poor . 
it is not an instrument with which to make music . 
i wanted to like this case ,  i really did . 
plus ,  tennis balls are very cheap and will likely last much longer . 
i am a programmer ,  and i touch type my code . 
did not like the quality of the makeup at all . 
once again ,  you get what you pay for . 
i was no shaky or jittery ,  so i thought it was good . 
or risk getting a good one and a bad one . 
we are both much happier now that she is housebroken for the outside . 
i ve not seen what it produces under the  course  setting . 
the plastic is thin ,  and the metal contact pins are all exposed . 
many better choices at amazon a lot better . 
num_extend it doesn t fit on with the large back strap . 
this was the first of the smackdown games . 
switched to sonicare instead ,  was about time for a replacement anyways . 
it is a cheap looking synthetic mat with a print . 
i bought my first krups cappuccino maker back in the num_extend
the num_extend remained locked in the num_num ch mode . 
again ,  it may be somewhat real ,  but it is tediously dull . 
i have yet to have a bird go near it though . 
i would not recommend this case to anyone . 
ok if your feline doesn t mind keeping her paw still . 
now my dog s hair is very silky and smells great as well . 
this is just poor and it should have been in the description . 
they had a well deserved reputation for rugged clothes . 
i m heartbroken because it could be such a great product . 
no results you couldn t get with a cheap can of noxzema . 
save your time and money and get another product . 
i will buy a better one when i couldn t fix it anymore . 
i rented two other action games ,  transformer and dragon quest swords . 
the explosion was loud enough to scare several pedestrians . 
they still turn on and charge but the buttons do not work . 
i got tired of using that with hardly no results . 
but ,  noooooo ,  this is about an inch to short . 
at least jazz it up and make the packaging nice . 
in fact i forgot i even ordered them . 
my twins love oatmeal mixed with their food . 
second unit too had the similar packing but no damages . 
old daughter is constantly struggling with tangles in her long hair . 
i don t know why the reviews here are so glowing . 
i should have ordered it two sizes bigger . 
to begin with ,  mine did not keep time very well . 
made my eyes itch like crazy both times i wore it . 
the product is very cheaply made and doesn t hold up . 
i have since upgraded my phone so i never use it . 
when mounted to the camera ,  it is always getting in the num_extend
when we first got it ,  we loved the suction and filtering . 
i bought one for my mom last christmas num_extend and she loved it . 
i got once from local beauty supply store for num_num bucks . 
the problem is that it s not red glass . 
or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy . 
will need to buy pricey dvi cable ,  too . 
i got the case and made one num_num minute phone call . 
either way it wasn t strong enough to bring in that wall hanger . 
however recording a choir or something would work . 
nowhere in any documentation does it mention which characters are taboo . 
i wish i had returned them but now it s too late . 
the duracell mygrid charging device is a product you want to like . 
try putting a phone with the otterbox defender in it . 
but it was expensive so i was expecting better quality . 
got it for free as part of some promotion . 
they claim leather but it is really faux leather aka . 
the bra is much smaller than my bali bras . 
the crayon breaks off in little pieces and gets all over the num_extend
i definitely got num_num months use out of it . 
unfortunately now stuck with num_num boxes that no one will drink . 
i ve never had a screen protector do this . 
i would never buy one without an extended warranty ,  though . 
they go in ,  but they work their way loose . 
i wouldn t even use these stainless bowls for feeding my dog . 
hocke ,  num_extend a marketing web technician for ministry medical group and st . 
bought a replacement and it did not work . 
the marble mouse is cheaper too ,  which is odd . 
should not be necessary to write more than we wish to say . 
all i can say is that altec has done much better . 
i was fairly excited to hear about this product . 
i really wanted to like these headphones  see below  . 
oh yes i was mad , and their deep chips . 
i really don t like this one at all . 
everybody noticed right away that she was yellow . 
my first and last experience with zojirushi products went something like num_extend
to start off ,  these do sound pretty good . 
i lost everything for gamecube as far as saved information goes . 
they were either childish or not my type . 
we took this back the very next day . 
both linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement . 
i don t even use it because i was so disappointed with it . 
we could not believe how many pieces this has . 
but i found that it wasn t very effective . 
i still would expect this to last longer than it did . 
it was such a disappointment ,  because i really wanted it to work . 
for more information on resynchronizing this device please see knowledge base article num_extend
otherwise ,  you re not going to see any benefit from  multimedia  capabilities . 
there was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in . 
it wasn t very clean and always peeled off to easy . 
my english bulldog was a powerful chewer already at num_num weeks . 
would not recommend ordering from polsteins homeandbeyond to anyone !  my mistake !  . 
steam and smoke is displayed as big successive blocks of floating transparent maps . 
the description said i was buying a new item . 
now i can only use them while not moving around . 
i personally don t like to carry that way . 
useless if they break in two the second time out . 
it looked like this product was already used when it arrived . 
impossible to work with and mold to your teeth . 
they eat their way through the product to get to the food . 
therefore i am never sure what my reading is . 
spend a few dollars more and time and ,  ultimately ,  money . 
sorry if my previous review persuaded someone to purchase this item . 
i used the num_extend only for imac computer . 
also it is not a very substantial piece . 
i purchased several of these headsets prior to upgrading to a bluetooth headset . 
i have taken this product for over a year . 
unfortunately it doesn t hold up to a num_num pound puppy enjoying it . 
i used all of the attachment less than num_num times . 
it s a finer grind and the taste of herbs outweighs the salt . 
i bought the pan to make besan flour pancakes . 
i ll keep it ,  and hopefully it will grow on me . 
i ended up spending a long time with this under very hot water . 
i d avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green . 
i have not had any coraline bloom or growth . 
i use my old braun ,  which uses melita filters . 
sierra is obviously having some problems ,  and this is not pretty . 
i reglued it and so far it s worked fine . 
she would cry non stop because of all the gas . 
my boyfriend and i eat roasted garlic all the time . 
otherwise ,  stick to a computer and a tricycle . 
but this stuff i have to say was not worth it . 
the one that was charged i will try to use . 
secondly ,  the product was overly sweet for me . 
hard to get a kid of this age to really pinpoint such things . 
my dog absolutely loves and is obsessed with this toy . 
i cannot safely use it anymore ,  and it cannot be num_extend
i have got to start reading owners  reviews more closely . 
you dont even have to be in time to complete the song . 
when you try to sharpen them they just crumble . 
this was the healthiest thing since ,  well ,  fruit . 
the reason i will not buy again is because of the packaging . 
i actually resorted to wearing them backwards so that they wouldnt be wasted . 
i found myself wanting to wash it out of my hair immediately . 
however it did not achieve this status for nothing . 
another bad protector just like other inexpensive ones . 
it s easy to put on and looks okay on . 
i thought maybe i didn t put enough on ,  so i reapplied . 
better than fruity but not nice like some herbal shampoos . 
he opened the box ,  my husband blew it up . 
the padding on this bra is too thin and too soft for me . 
the only redeeming quality of this phone is the call quality . 
i was so disappointed in the quality of this magnetic spice rack . 
gone are the days of solid testing before a release . 
used more next time and it did not brew stronger . 
after a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty . 
it makes three attempts before doing a full recalculation . 
i have a drawer full ,  in search of the perfect . 
i could use saran wrap as a better screen protector then these things . 
i have owned this machine for num_num years . 
at the beginning i was happy with this cream . 
it broke num_num weeks after we got it . 
the light still comes on but the phone won t charge . 
these are not very expensive and they just look so darned good . 
the snorkel mouthpiece tasted like plastic and was too large for my mouth . 
fits my wrist so i can hold my sony num_extend player . 
let s be honest ,  the speaker in this thing sounds terrible . 
a good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder . 
they do work ,  if you use them in just the right way . 
i bought this funnel set specifically to save deep fry oil for reuse . 
yep not blue or red ,  but black and it lights up black . 
this works much better for her keeping the fleas off . 
we got this as a gift when my child was around num_extend so num_extend
i bought these for my twins when they were around num_extend
they also looked like cheap plastic not leather . 
i m not sure why some people like it ,  but some do . 
it s hard to find the sweet spot that really works . 
now i m back to filling num_num water dishes daily . 
this toy is more trouble than it s worth . 
you can wring the grease out of it . 
one of the compartments broke the num_extend time i used it . 
for these lights to be noticeable it has to be pretty dark . 
i would not recommend anyone purchase this scope . 
he put it on ,  and it was an absolute joke . 
never felt more energy or that my workouts were better at all . 
all of the lavanila perfumes last all day  !  . 
i put it on the fake nails and on my real nails . 
i bought some on amazon ,  and it was the same . 
this was the first of several earth friendly automatic dishwasher detergents i tried . 
hubby brews the pot as one of those lovely breakfast in bed scenes . 
so i really don t know how this game is . 
i will not purchase again and will not recommend it to anyone . 
there you actually have something to hold onto . 
american made craftsmanship died in the early num_extend
don t buy unless you are willing to take the risk . 
palmone offers no service or compensation to it s customers . 
i had put new brand name batteries in the train . 
these batteries are the sole reason i will never buy another canon camera . 
it s the worse most frustrating piece of technology i ve ever owned . 
it just seems like fancy spray bottle of soap . 
even the more dilute angel eyes tastes really bad . 
there s just no point in adding it to this product . 
i order num_num pair and each one is different in quality and fit . 
they all have a good storyline along with excellent gameplay . 
it was extremely drying and somewhat harsh on my sensitive skin . 
the router also disconnects you every num_num hours . 
cute ,  but the pins are hard to get to stand up . 
would need a major commercial machine to wash these beds . 
they were also a bit heavy ,  but still comfortable . 
i saw no difference in my skin while using this . 
i was happy to find a graham cracker that was fairly healthy . 
they should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much . 
the cheese flavor is weak and kind of off . 
i tried some of this while visiting my brother . 
some are going to work well and some don t . 
why didn t i just read the packaging and put it down . 
i really don t know why it has such good reviews on here . 
silent hill num_extend the suffering ,  and fatal frame num_num are better choices . 
i had the same problem with another glamorise bra . 
i have recently switched back to a regular box . 
the good thing is that the posts and backs were solid and secure . 
in the beginning it felt nice but that didn t last long . 
the pan that arrived did not have the thremospot . 
he has tear stains and my breeder recommended the product to me . 
i would not recommend this toy for anyone . 
they merely put a scratched mylar coating on the plastic . 
the blender was very convenient but could not blend some things like hummus . 
will keep on trying until i find something he ll like . 
i have been using norelco razor s for years . 
bad idea !  these strips are so tin and narrow . 
there are also new beaches ,  jungles and islands to play volleyball . 
i see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look . 
for those who wants to purchase thi num_num degree turn stop . 
i didn t even bother to turn this on . 
the item was clean ,  but seemed to have been used . 
buy it for your worst enemies children if you are that cruel . 
not what i expected from desert essence products . 
i did keep it in the dark cabinet as the instructions said . 
if i could give this num_num stars i would . 
see picture added ,  best i could do with phone camera . 
i only bought it because it was massively on sale . 
but the stitching was irregular on the front . 
glad it wasn t too expensive ,  it made a good toy . 
i got these and within a day they were scratched up . 
they can t really walk it around or cradle it . 
there is no way this is true bypass . 
however it is now leaking water all over the counter . 
so much for my doing business with this seller . 
wash with your hand and dry off with a soft cloth . 
do yourself a favor and dont buy this garbage . 
for reference ,  i have num_extend type curly hair . 
it s like using plain water to wash the window or glass . 
this is a typical stuffed ball for a small dog . 
the sims bustin out is a really really boring game . 
this problem occured with two separate sets of disks . 
i don t think i will buy it again . 
this is with no tension on either side of the zipper seam . 
my other family member threw up shortly after eating this . 
don t buy it unless you got some green to burn . 
well all i want to say is the game is pathetic . 
didn t fit my iphone num_num in the least . 
i can t say that i ve seen a noticeable difference . 
but ,  these boots are just kind of sloppy . 
cheepo version that does not come close to the original . 
cheap !  just wraps around the outside of the iphone . 
keep that in mind if you are thinking of using this cable . 
 for any players reading this review ,  it is the numlock key  . 
then  top  the vegetable with the pusher cup . 
i prefer other products that make you num_extend if you catch my drift . 
well their pumps do not hold up to much of that . 
the ones you use to wash your car . 
i wouldn t want to pt in these boots . 
however ,  the wiremold concealer is better in every way . 
the lights are on ,  the phone says its charging but nothing happens . 
these treats didn t go over well with our picky eater . 
i tried it once and threw it away . 
it s way too dry and looks very cakey under my eyes . 
ten minutes later at the restaurant ,  the camera wouldn t turn on . 
i usually use the turbie twist but needed another and got thus instead . 
the other num_extend ounces is distilled water plant glycerin and grain alcohol . 
garber should be doing some controlled studies on his products . 
i bought another product and i love it . 
i suffer from ibs and have been taking probiotics for many years . 
my two boys ,  ages num_num and num_num were not enthusiastic about it . 
i ll be putting it away soon and keeping the balls out . 
my hands were sore and my patience level was gone . 
i m really disappointed in the thinness in these socks . 
after day num_extend my sugar was consistently low . 
the fit was loose and one screw was missing . 
a hot dog so ask questions before you buy it . 
save you money and buy a real vacuum . 
if you have windows xp ,  the game will run fine . 
i selected it and entered my encryption key . 
no system in the game is remotely taken in to the game . 
so far ,  the better polos i ve worn are from brooks brothers . 
i finally stopped using it and my head felt so much better . 
i would have liked it better if it was bigger . 
the charger does not work unless you hold the cord . 
my love bird had the mirrors unuseable in three days . 
i need something that works and is safe for my dog . 
horrible  !  both of my cases looks terrible . 
i fully charged it and it was zapped after one single iphone replenishment . 
i am going back to a simpler design . 
this is an excerpt from the full review penned by mr . 
check out the consumer wellness research center website ,  . 
the gameplay can become a bit addictive ,  after a point . 
the ergonomics are outstanding ,  but a gamer needs durability too !  . 
it s a beautful guitar and and i m loving it !  . 
when the groove side is down ,  it grips nicely . 
didnt really help her much ,  therapy worked best for the heel spur . 
only num_num of your skills can be used at any time . 
i won t buy any brand constructed this way again . 
unsafe and disappointed as it came off her . 
it had a good start with the cutscene at the beginning . 
these tissues are really reminiscent of the sears catalog days in the outhouse . 
i bought this for my bf and he loved it at first . 
because of this ,  it tells me i don t get enough light . 
never expect a real fight when you face one on one with them . 
i like the look of this cover but it is just too bulky . 
my kids never seemed interested in actually sitting and spinning on this thing . 
my num_num year old lost interest in this very quickly . 
the color is also more tan than the picture . 
it said num_num drops per ounce and it was total num_num ounces . 
so i thought i might have a bad copy as it was used . 
nice level editor and multiplayer ,  though i wish it was online . 
a week later ,  they were all broken off so it was useless . 
i know this because it broke even though i was closely following directions . 
please see my review of the sennheiser hd num_num headphones for more information . 
the original pads had nice tight pores and lasted a long time . 
it got all over her !  we ended up chucking it . 
it is virtually the same hydrogen peroxide bleaching solution that dentists use . 
sadly i m going to have to agree with those reports . 
not unless you live somewhere where it is always dark . 
it was so loud i could hear it upstairs . 
i was putting this together when the antenna just broke off . 
this is probably the worst and that s saying a lot . 
i ordered an new battery and don t even need it now . 
i have people ask me regularly if i am sunburned . 
the glasses are cheap in construction ,  quality ,  and have thin glass . 
it s as sweet as captain crunch  for those of you who remember  . 
it looks like you are wearing grey eyeliner . 
i remember previous generations of zagg last forever . 
shipped fairly quick ,  arrived a bit late but that was ok . 
i hated these as soon as i put them on . 
these are always a pain in the butt to put on . 
broke when i was trying to take it off the first time !  . 
this add on is garbage ,  the video was terrible . 
turns out that bluetooth issues with this phone are a known issue . 
there was very little packing and the item was broke . 
a beefier design could make this potentially good product into a good product . 
this item is cheaper than silpat but i was not happy with it . 
even had these things not broken ,  it s really low quality . 
good bandages that were exactly what i expected . 
to turn ,  you push only one or the other . 
i choke it down because i know how good it is for me . 
this is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial . 
this case always made my phone look and feel dirty . 
my captivate let me customize songs and voice messages as ringtones . 
everything burns in this thing unless you watch it . 
man this is so highly fragranced that my allergies went through the roof . 
sadly that is not the case with cuisinart . 
the only claims made are for copper ,  mercury and cadmium . 
all i can say is watch your blood pressure folks . 
i purchased mine at a local store for $  one num_num ounce bag  . 
i was so excited to see an acne control pressed powder . 
still ,  it just seems like a half ass job . 
i used it mainly to clean the bathroom floors and under furniture . 
no wonder i originally gave the game a low rating . 
amazon gave me a credit as the seller never replied . 
i have restitched the entire thing myself using heavier thread . 
this is not the program shown on tv . 
so i rinse with water and dry upside down daily . 
i had to pretty much assemble the whole thing by myself . 
i ll just get free replacement temples ,  or so i thought . 
you have got to hide these toys when your not around . 
wrong !  these rulers are extremely hard to open . 
he also can use wing shield ,  charge ,  and horn dive . 
closing it is also uncomfortable because the liner lock is extremely stiff . 
i can t say enough but we had ants everywhere . 
this time i used some of the french roast folgers . 
it is almost not worth buying anything in this day and age . 
pull it out of your pocket ?  put the rubber back on . 
the lock is now malfunctioning on one side . 
unfortunately ,  this large carrier is way too small for him . 
i am glad i sold it and the game guide . 
direction stickers were marked on the wrong sides . 
it s frustrating and the markers are hit or miss . 
also ,  the mechanics are loud as is the voice . 
majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as active num_extend
i rarely give one star reviews but this deserves it . 
there are so many expensive natural products out there . 
it is not worth to spend $ for this cheap simple stand . 
the pot on the inside does not have the same copper coloring . 
you can wear it under clothing and it is secure !  . 
replaced it with a $ conair trimmer and am much happier . 
basic toy that has been around since probably my mother was small . 
the bottle appeared to have leaked out at some point . 
gave it to her at num_extend and she had it torn about by num_extend
i expected them to last a bit longer . 
this will drive you insane in a hurry . 
came with parts broken and is very flimsy . 
the sides were very loose and should be handled with care if ordered . 
i don t understand all the hype about tivoli radios . 
if i can do without them ,  i do . 
after using it on ten different valves the tip broke off . 
the logo says % of what you want . 
but compare with the regular shoes ,  they are true to the size . 
returned because it was not usb as i thought . 
i would recommend u buy a better protecter that cost more . 
i put one on top of a nickel . 
my dog definitely didn t like the sound or the vibration . 
in each case ,  the plastic coating starting flaking off . 
garber s natural solutions for anxiety throughout the day as needed . 
i ve used nyx s strawberry milk for a long time . 
obviously mexico ,  where these are made ,  is in the usa now . 
it was safe in the shell ,  but the mount was toasted . 
perhaps some craft person can conjure a practical use for these . 
these days ,  the toys do all of the thinking for our children . 
i always apply good moisturizer whether i am wearing makeup or not . 
has num_num bungee type cords on it when closed which i really like . 
when a cable plugged in ,  the ports lighting up fine . 
when you let go it starts going round and round inside the cage . 
the blade does come out of the handle for cleaning . 
result .  .  .  . horrible pain on the shoulders when wearing this . 
it worked great until about that one year mark . 
alternativly they make a blade with unpainted but burnished metal . 
i returned them and found something better at the local discount store . 
i only gave num_num star because of fast delivery . 
this makes me think it s not really doing a great job filtering . 
it is flimsy and floppy and fell right off . 
the reticle started floating inside of the site . 
there is a plastic holder between the rubber suction and the plastic baster . 
the way it comes out of the box makes the adjustment too short . 
my daughter asked for this game for her birthday . 
the router seemed easy to set up including adding a wep for security . 
this battery is almost as ineffective as my original . 
this tape while it is for comfort does not stick . 
more or less just try to get it down as fast as possible . 
they work well enough just sitting at my desk at work . 
i was very disappointed with this brand because they are so thin . 
i kind of wanted to get this review out there asap . 
he pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects . 
would love it if all headsets came in a case like this one . 
when they say scratch resistant i do give them credit . 
this was great for the first num_num months . 
there are also not enough flares to get around with either . 
i have just  had it  with my second num_extend
i ve had a corded logitech trackball for num_num years i think . 
when i got the box ,  it seemed like a well designed item . 
but have a very short adjust ment range . 
then i contacted the seller ,  fresh bontanica ,  to return the item . 
i tried but could not turn it on . 
galt used to make it ,  now it s a different company . 
very thin and an initial greasy feel that does dissipate . 
you d think that d be a pretty important conformation standard . 
then sometimes it goes off for no reason at all . 
i tried to like it but it the drawback was too great . 
it is on the sour side and leaves a slight unpleasant aftertaste . 
i got this a few days after it came out . 
my lashes look crunchy and don t hold a curl . 
i brought it to sears ,  and exchanged it . 
i tried the xl and it was too big . 
my mother who is left handed ,  doesnt have the same problem . 
see my review for the taylor precision num_extend food scale . 
it s a shame because i really like those . 
but i seriously wouldn t pay more than $ for it . 
you need to cut the same object to tell the big difference . 
i would not recommend unless you are using for display only . 
there is a $ shipping fee; mail to :  wm . 
i bought this because monster cable has a good reputation . 
i enjoy numi rose white tea which tastes wonderful . 
this case is overrated as far as i am concerned . 
others giving reviews loved it so it is a very subjective thing . 
i broke two of these already in my num_extend caliber rifle . 
you get what you pay for i suppose . 
the back strap also did not fit right . 
i did not have any noticeable reduction in fine lines . 
i never got tiffens before ,  had good experience with hoyas . 
it doesn t taste like a berry of any kind by my standards . 
beautiful fabric ,  wonderful construction ,  but not my kind of bra . 
these pull back ,  plastic mechanisms broke at the factory bolt . 
i am dissapointed in this product and will not buy again . 
this was the newest one purchased and it didn t last . 
it could be a problem on either end . 
varieties of vanilla and caramel are my favorites . 
i am not happy with the color either . 
the same company even makes that style and sells it for cheaper . 
the new graphics and game play make me motion sick . 
nevertheless when heading to the arcade it was already packed  duh japan right  . 
i bought this game for nostalgia more than anything else . 
sadly i saw no difference in my hair . 
the video look choppy when streaming and it looks like crap . 
now two weeks later ,  i have yet to receive a call . 
so in num_num days my cat got well again thank goodness . 
needless to say my feet take a beating in my steel toe shoes . 
otherwise ,  this cd is really just not that exciting . 
nothing against the product i thought it was fine . 
this case is nice and slim and is cheap . 
i use a canon eos num_extend num_extend and wear glasses . 
unfortunately this brush was nothing close to the ecotool qualityit sheds like crazy . 
these claim to be for high arches ,  and my arches are high . 
i wont be buying another case like it at all . 
neither the remote nor the machine buttons work . 
i do not like the texture of this gluten free oatmeal product . 
from the first one ,  it put grounds in every cup of coffee . 
i think they detract from the richness of the purple colour . 
the game itself is ok but the graphics are terrible . 
i am afraid they published a stinker of a game !  . 
figured i could run numerous air stones and bubble wands off of this . 
good luck getting the hoop around a finger ,  even . 
i tried it again at num_num and it did not age well . 
notice the other reviews of folks looking to replace their broken comb guides . 
don t see a difference with and without this filter . 
the closest description i can offer is it smells like original frebreze . 
i don t know how this game is getting num_num stars . 
we bought the large version ,  which just wasn t very large . 
the soy increased my estrogen level ,  which caused me to accumulate more num_extend
but i was disappointed after having used natural sponges my entire life . 
pain in the butt to return things that aren t marked correctly . 
i would not have bought this pedometer had i known these things . 
in the dim light of the range i couldn t see the sights . 
the only purchase i have ever sent back to amazon . 
i have sensitive skin and this is not compatible . 
the bra was my size but did not fit as it should have . 
you may note that i rated the game as  fun  but overall  poor  . 
if you use it ,  they will round off your bolts . 
this is cage looks nice but is mot functional . 
they keep changing the product name to shed the bad reviews . 
so i didnt care about that either . but my dog . 
this toy was extremely disappointing for my num_num year old son . 
for a land route ,  you have to build a road . 
picked this up from radio shack as a novelty item . 
do not order on amazon when you have the flu . 
a call to pantene today confirmed my perception of this change . 
we contacted them again ,  a month later ,  it finally came . 
i get about num_num charges out of it and that is fine . 
the quality has gone down substancially in one year . 
bianchi used to make a similar belt that worked quite well . 
the actual case does not look like the picture . 
spend the extra $ and buy an original . 
i take great care of my tents as well . 
but again after sitting for a while ,  again the metallic taste . 
as life gets older ,  things should be easier . 
$ an oz vs $ for baked kettles in subscription . 
i wasn t pleased at all with these leggings . 
i ve looked for an amp rating ,  but can not find one . 
i noticed no difference in my energy level whatsoever . 
it s not even sticky and it comes out far too thickly . 
loses accuracy after riding in the saddle bag for a while . 
no idea what it s called ,  but it doesn t taste good . 
the game play was kinda slow but still good . 
secondly ,  it wouldn t charge my phone at all . 
i received poison as a christmas gift this year . 
it requires version num_extend of the intellipoint software . 
this is cheap ,  but it is also very flimsy and small . 
i will hold off on reviewing that product for a couple of months . 
looks nice but this one appears to be malfuncting . 
i received one bar of his awful tasting mess . 
not really happy that the earring didn t stay on my ear . 
they are so overseasoned and so oversalted ,  they make your eyes water . 
tried to charge the battery with num_num different chargers and all failed . 
my last order was all fluff and no weight . 
these plates are priced low so you may think you getting a bargain . 
i bought this item because i wanted a compact dish dryer . 
trains can come into this set ,  but can t leave . 
i wasted my money coz i had to trash it away . 
occasionally when you surface ,  vexx will do a jump . 
the idea was great ,  but the execution is lacking . 
if i got a smaller cup size it might ve fit better . 
i hate the smell and i am all about great scents . 
we didn t play this game immediately after receiving it . 
this makes for a much more digestible product for many people . 
just the way the two fighters attack each other is so boring . 
i didnt even know this came out and i wish i still hadnt . 
you get what ya pay for i guess . 
it works great wired but wireless range is terrible . 
it has a warped view and is impossible to use . 
it didn t have a creamy ,  silky feel to it . 
i read the ingredients on the bottle i bought . 
i tried taking pictures of it ,  but there was no difference . 
fortunately amazon sent me a return lable and gave me a full refund . 
i was told they d get back to me . 
the first day ,  i stayed on hold num_num minutes . 
i notice more of a tangy aftertaste with this flavor than the chocolate . 
i m disabled and all num_num of my casio . 
i purchased this cloth to clean a lot of my sterling silver jewelry . 
the first one did not work at all ,  fan was broken . 
i got this for my almost num_num years daughter s christmas present . 
the mirror surface itself is very good ,  no ripples . 
she ripped it up and ate the stuffing within minutes . 
it is mostly likely caused by the tilting function . 
overall just did not like the look of it in the black . 
it tried to make this work then went back to disposable blades . 
an old set of rabbit ears worked better then this antenna . 
this was not what i thought it would be . 
this stuff is not like the  brick  it shows on the commercials . 
i say almost becase i am blochy now . 
these discs are reusable num_num to num_num times . 
my dog is a golden retriever and she needs a much taller dish . 
can only run one num_num inch air stone on this ,  rather disappointing . 
within a couple of months ,  the handle was bending . 
doesn t work well ,  just pulls the child under water backwards !  . 
it just took me a while to see that . 
if you have large breed dogs do not order . 
very annoying and disappointing considering the fact that i actually like the case . 
i ve always had good luck with maxell dvd media . 
this gizmo doesn t fit the hot shoe mount . 
useless ,  the rake does not do the scooping . 
thanks to amazon for having an easy return process . 
the back said that it was multiplayer ,  so i picked it up . 
this would be a crackerjack little grinder if it always worked . 
do not buy from cuisinart is my recommendation . 
the clear crystal cube earring is much better . 
after disconnecting the headset the problem is gone . 
i was definitely left wanting a more intense flavor and kick . 
mine last for over a year and held up to everything !  . 
bristles are falling out and covered my whole face . 
i tried it out ,  hated it and sent it back . 
my dog carried and interactive mallard of theirs around the house for months . 
some heard the echo worse than the others ,  but all heard it . 
 :   i m sure it s great for the right pet . 
i contacted to microsoft and i ve the most recent driver update . 
extremely long i thought it would be a much better quality . 
they took a beautiful and classic fragrance and just ruined it . 
that expense is what lost it one star . 
this is a very bulky item when both parts are connected . 
this is a nice idea that doesnt work at all . 
you can do better at your local pharmacy . 
the quality of these headphones is not good at all . 
i would not buy again and would not recommend . 
it s sp ,  compared with its predecessor ,  is complete garbage . 
less coordinated people like my elderly mom can t use the thing . 
to be honest ,  i didn t expect much from this . 
the cover is attached to the headset with a very thin vinyl cloth . 
when you go to stack the cups ,  they just slide off . 
there s only one divider the barely hinges on one side . 
this was purchased as a gift for our num_num year old son . 
i bought this player about a year and a half ago . 
not even a warning message on the phone . 
i can t tell how good this product is . 
installed this and the mega super antenna option . 
the tops lost their shapes and got saggy . 
product description shows fry pan perched nicely pn top of a jetboil . 
my hair seemed a little oily and looked darker . 
the butt strap is too small to fit around many butt stocks . 
it just died  blows the fuse when turned on  . 
plantronics should be ashamed of themselves ,  selling this for $
who is the idiot that design this  ?  . 
it was more royal blue than this bright blue . 
i hope someone plugs it in before taking it home . 
i love the longevity of a good one ,  so i keep trying . 
granted ,  ther are more convenient in a place without water . 
it doesnt light up like the baby tad . 
so far only black kong and planet dog orbee tuff can survive . 
tried to give it away to a couple of people . 
this shadow is really not that great ,  you can barely see it . 
i hold them up and could wear them like a shirt . 
these are very low quality spoons and not worth purchasing . 
but unfortunately they didn t help him with his limp . 
when it did finally arrive ,  there was no packaging . 
band size was not snug enough to be supportive . 
if so ,  i will write another review then . 
the earbuds come with three additional eartips to allow for a good fit . 
the reality is that it is a small cheap looking item . 
those pellets that fit snugly generally fire true . 
but i use it in my home and dont work like i wish . 
i ordered this for my num_extend and it was too loose . 
the bristles on this brush bend and fold over . 
it is poorly built ,  and hard to hear my calls . 
their heads are separate from their bodies and have been glued on . 
unfortunately ,  it turned out more like oblivion on dope . 
at the end i must mention the poor quality of power consumption . 
the item is useless if you can t charge it . 
a wedgie is not what i was going for !  . 
there is no seal on top ,  just the lid . 
as if there were not already enough memory formats ,  yet another one . 
i gave the can to my teenager to finish . 
extremely well built but the cats won t get near it . 
i love having my cable speed on my laptop . 
the coin purse ripped within days of getting it . 
the game has so many bugs i cant describe them all . 
not worth the money ,  time ,  or trouble to send them back . 
the band was too narrow and made the watch look very cheap . 
i used it once and never used it again . 
they seem very nice ,  but were two sizes too small . 
there are better toys out there for youngsters . 
now when i placed this cone on her neck she easily removed it . 
ordered olephobic version of this protector for my galaxy note ii . 
maybe the flavored coffees just aren t for me . 
the liquid may get into your phone and damage it . 
its small and useless like a tiny rothco knife . 
the dove men+ deep clean body wash is nothing to write home about . 
i hate playing this one with the kids . 
difficult to get in and out of pocket . 
i noticed a lot of fatty aspic in this along with the sardines . 
in fact ,  the instructions alluded to  accessories  that were not included . 
got it for wifey and she hated it from day one . 
well bought this thinking it would help lower the print on me . 
the ones here do not stay locked on . 
being that this only comes in one size that s a big downside . 
i should have thought it through more carefully . 
get it if you want to be irritated . 
while the die cuts match nothing else matches . 
it s pretty amazing to see these two blades side by side . 
the center of the eraser never erases anything . 
we were really enthusiastic about playing this game as a family . 
my shipment did not arrive in two days later as promised . 
not with all herbal essence conditioners ,  only this particular one . 
i suggest a metallic case instead of plastic . 
i like the regular  go between brushes  much better . 
top end num_extend cables ,  creative s upconvert ,  and eq s . 
i actually bought another one to replace this one . and here s num_extend
every time i use the cooker ,  i tighten the handle . 
because of this ,  amazon refunded my product price and shipping . 
i would just get a another antenna for a little more money . 
also the fabric makes it harder to blow them up . 
i had to give it to a friend because of the color . 
it plays more like some arcade game as you move about the levels . 
i used the machine over and over the spot till it seemed clean . 
it worked awesome . then we ran out of fluid . 
sadly i took off my beloved new shoes . 
my first complaint is that the ark comes apart into too many pieces . 
if you don t know the difference ,  please look it up . 
i ve written several requests for solutions ,  some a month ago . 
going left to right was not happening with me . 
i planted the seeds ,  but they did not sprout . 
i have num_extend on an epiphone joe pass model . 
i love that one i have been wearing that one for years . 
the note ii just fits by jamming it in place . 
the jobst and truform s were easy by comparison . 
now am returning because these are too large . 
we will use it some other days and see what happen . 
i could actually smell that distinct odor of frying circuit board . 
the cd s would play fine in other players . 
will be returning it ,  if i can findth receipt !  . 
hold your nose ,  close your eyes and swallow . 
how can you wear a glove when you have wet num_extend
that means you can t put in longer cables if you need to . 
it s been sitting in the corner for num_num weeks now . 
i had a set of these in blue for a while . 
i have tiny ears compared to the average person . 
the num_extend pure racers have been more sparse for me . 
it seems odd too given that they are stainless steel . 
i did not get another and will do more research before purchasing another . 
these games are stupid ,  make no sense at all . 
you get experience ,  but you get no items . 
it is not going in my mouth one more time . 
if you can t look at num_extend don t try this . 
anyway next day i come back thinking ill now do my facial . 
after trying it out for over a week ,  i sent it back . 
even at num_num months no one wanted to play with it . 
i got these at the store for $ for two crusts . 
i decided to try it on a cyst under the skin . 
i place the product in wet cat food and mix it up . 
its a childs toy they should really make it a bit more durable . 
all you do is run forward and shoot alians ,  no originality . 
i wanted a crovel ,  but there s a nice long waiting list . 
i am sending mine to a trash bin !  . 
i was quite pleased with my trial and first encounter of this device . 
the material is cheap vinyl and is not going to last . 
this product reminded me of sour koolaid with a bit of fizz . 
great concept but the stereo plug does not fit snug . 
list is coming; hold on to your hat ,  toupee ,  or tresses . 
as an experienced gamer ,  i had high expectations for this game . 
i have suffered from terrible pollen allergies for years . 
i didn t care for this case at all . 
however ,  don t expect miracles even with extra ir . 
i am petite and obese and this still isn t small enough . 
there s a few schools of thought on studio monitors . 
now amazon wants me to review it ,  so here your are . 
the label on the drops says  discard after num_num days  . 
so here we have sweet grease with grit . 
it was cool seeing trevor ,  but that s about it . 
this is due to the sufficiently long stem . 
this batch was not like what i ve received in the past . 
i remove the adapter and plug my meter directly into the lighter . 
not what was advertised ,  unit was to tight for wrist . 
i then confirmed all settings and it still would not work . 
i have another cover made by body armor that is pretty good . 
the picture got much much worse so now i m out twelve bucks . 
i have tried this ,  advantage and recently ,  frontline tritak . 
the initial feedback was it did not sound good . 
this is the cheapest made product i ve ever owned . 
ii was excited to receive this grinder and start using it . 
i bought these after recently being diagnosed as type num_num diabetic . 
i ll only focus on the most important :  gameplay . 
i bought this charger for my htc my touch num_extend
not even nero can bring it back to life . 
i found these bars to be way too sticky and sweet . 
this item lasted only num_num years or so . 
this watch is not for people with small wrists . 
no glow but a new hurting pimples on my forehead . 
i purchased this griddle because my old electric griddle had worn out . 
also ,  the ear buds don t rest the same in my ears . 
i found it ,  while sweetened ,  to be bitter and watery . 
then at the beggining of january i got super smash bros . 
at least someone is getting some use out of it . 
the game is pretty much stealth kill ahoy . 
cans arrived in perfect condition ,  but the corn has little taste . 
character a says something in english ,  and character b responds in japanese . 
bic used to be top of the line in razor blade companies . 
it s not worth one second of your time . 
this product doesn t seem to work for me . 
but shame on them for not making a quality product . 
just more cords and chargers to lay around the house . 
unfortunately this one was ill fitting and had a defect . 
i tried these for three days and they seemed to work . 
back to dermalogica and image skincare !  glad i tried though . 
the first time it cost $ to replace with a refurbished unit . 
i also think it cracked one of my dog s teeth . 
background :  i am a big fan of trader joe s coffee . 
for nikon to release such a poorly constructed product is surprising . 
our pyrex cup arrived out of the box with a defective handle . 
i ve tried it with the internal light on and off . 
get your butt handed to you by those who actually pay num_extend
i called revlon and they said they will give me a refund . 
it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around . 
you would think they would test these before sending them out . 
get the following  home depot or amazon has all this num_extend
i have used memorex in the past with no problems . 
i tried it in my car and it worked great for three months . 
i was very disappointed with the sound quality . 
is it so hard for companies to make an actual white shade ?  . 
this was at a distance of about num_num meters num_extend feet  . 
didn t do anything !  !  probiotics and plenty of water helps digestion . 
it is probably one of the lowest priced num_extend rated cameras . 
i suggest keep them low on the body . 
the rubber is too stiff for little hands to pull back very far . 
item should be have been described as a permanent mount . 
i do not recommend this product at all . 
this has to be one of the stickiest moisturizing lotions available . 
it smelled so good ,  and was strong in a good way . 
these were the first reusable panty liners i bought for myself . 
when i first got this about num_num days ago it worked great . 
i wish i had done my homework before purchasing this system . 
my num_num year old kitty gives it some attention but not a lot . 
the search for an indestructible plush toy continues . 
sims bustin  out will always be the best sims installment for num_extend
aside from the that it is a great small ,  light watch . 
i didn t believe it until it actually happened . 
the sound quality is reasonably good with great sounding bass . 
staying up late ,  building my fleets and running around the carribean . 
there is no protective material around anything in the box . 
what a terrible product !  sent it back immediately . 
they are great if you want a disposable shirt . 
i bought num_num of these pads for my cattery . 
thanks ,  but no thanks for making my hair smell good . 
so ,  i tried it anyway and it goes on thin . 
i purchased this feeder for several reasons :  num_extend
now is supposed to be a healthier brand compared to other brands . 
well ,  i bought this product taking in account reviews made by customers . 
next ,  the volume doesn t get that loud for me . 
i just don t understand how this thing is supposed to work . 
i then adjusted the trim until the rotation stopped . 
this pepper mill s internal workings broke apart after a few months . 
threads on the windage adjustment are too shallow and strip easily becoming useless . 
my biggest complaint about this game is the totally abysmal mouse movement . 
as you might have heard ,  this game was downright terrible . 
text tends to be fuzzy and colors are washed out . 
this case was gorgeous when i got it . 
i bought this out of curiosity and i don t like them . 
i ve had this less than num_num years used mostly on weekends . 
bet you very little ,  or close to none . 
i will never buy another walker with the two button release mechanism . 
it looked kinda fun while reading the description . 
this is definitely not the mouse trap i played as a kid . 
people will think you have urine on you . 
this item is not worth the plastic it s made from . 
too liquid and it goes everywhere during the application . 
my biggest beef was the extremely long dialogues . 
there is no elastic at all in the pants . 
when i opened the package it contained num_num screen protectors and a cloth . 
this game is very difficult to set up to even play it . 
the good news is that it s well made . 
this is a sophisticated radio controlled quad copter . 
beware ,  these do not come in their original box . 
long story short ,  read bug num_num on maemo s bug site . 
it could work for somebody else ,  but not me .   . 
but it sure makes them pointless for num_extend
i ll probably sell this attachment set and get a mandolin . 
if microsoft made this controller different i would like it . 
and those rewards that i mentioned are not permanent . 
does the job much better ,  and you can safely wash that . 
i never found a way to organize the inventory . 
what feels great to one person will be very uncomfortable to another . 
and this was a brand new game i didn t rent it . 
my most important requirements are clear conversation ,  noise reduction and talk time . 
all batteries dead on arrival  dealer doesn t rotate stock ?   . 
it smells good ,  but it does not hydrate my skin at all . 
glad i tried it ,  but would not recommend it . 
looks like more than $ but not really fun or entertaining at all . 
disappointed with the quality of this playmobil purchase . 
the cable hisses ,  crackles and pops right out of the package . 
unfortunately ,  although the price of this particular headphone set was nice . 
i bought one hub and it works great . 
like several others ,  i was enticed by the excellent price . 
so ,  it didn t hardly relax or  rescue  anybody . 
i can tell artificial wax on an apple . 
they feel twisted when i have them on . 
i saw it happen and couldn t believe my eyes . 
this is not the genius the first one was . 
samsung ear phones are pretty much junk and useless . 
there is no variation in the flavors either . 
this item was great for num_num months and then it died . 
but ,  for the most part ,  it doesn t even dissolve . 
lost pressure faster than when i had the staple in . 
nice unit just can t rock something like this in white . 
also ,  lately i ve heard food trickle out several times a day . 
would definitely not buy this again even though it is very inexpensive . 
i guess there are nothing that can help with a big belly . 
you re better off investing in a quality mascara . 
there are num_num different face styles for each gender . 
i give it one star because my kitty absolutely hated the taste . 
ironically ,  his was hung vertically at the top of the tank .   . 
this resulted in a good amount of stretch on the hairband . 
it shoots like a field point out to num_num yards . 
the darker side of this shadow is nicely pigmented and very pretty . 
it constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog . 
however ,  this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet . 
i finished the entire bottle and nothing different was felt . 
we had hoped this would help with that issue . 
should have known better because it was so inexpensive . 
this product is described as being suitable for pets up to num_num pounds . 
i bought this on a whim last time i needed dishwasher detergent . 
the slate works very well with my other strikers . 
his prices indicate he expects num_extend valves to fail in your lifetime . 
looked great at first glance ,  don t recall the intro specifically . 
i thought this would be bigger and better made . 
they refused to return it because it was missing one of the arrows . 
didn t even light up ,  let alone hold a charge . 
likewise ,  i was unprepared for the excessive noise . 
the tray on the inside does not lock into position . 
i recently bought from amazon and i didn t like them . 
very difficult to completely rinse out of sponge . 
i gave them num_num stars just because they are as pictured . 
it ended up in the back of my stash and i moved on . 
i ordered both the black and white socks . 
great price ,  but really not worth the hassle . 
if you are wanting a noisy heater get this . 
bought this product for our puppy that s going through kennel training . 
my daughter received this toy when she was num_num years old num_extend grade  . 
i was looking for a bb cream more like the internation versions . 
the finish of the kupo is much smoother . 
all three have had the exact same problems . 
our toy we couldnt return is going to get donated to less unfortunate . 
when an army takes damage ,  their color changes . 
these headsets are not very comfortable and the sound quality is mediocre . 
it just isnt as fun or challenging as i had hoped . 
but i can t recommend something that can do this . 
i ve owned this for a few years now . 
i wore these twice and dumped them in a corner . 
it didn t clip on well to my kayak . 
what arrived was a straight purple ,  no black scarf . 
within num_num minutes ,  my husband had num_num mosquito bites and i had num_extend
i ve switched back to straight water to clean the glass . 
the camera was a huge improvement on the terrible one on the evo . 
leaves little or no silicone on object being wiped down . 
used it three times and then threw it out . 
my num_num pound shepherd mix demolished the first one i gave her . 
in humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up . 
i changed the settings back the way they were in the beginning . 
because of the thickness of these pots ,  it takes like num_num min . 
but not long after the warrenty expired ,  so did the machine . 
within num_num minutes it was chewed to pieces . 
i guess it boils down to personal preference . 
it seemed to be more of a finish stripper instead of a restorer . 
waste of money and trust of amazon sellers . 
some type of fake leather wrapped around some thin cardboard . 
i was very disappointed as the reviews were very promising . 
the hard part is what to do next . 
halfway through the day he would start smelling horrible . 
it does not have the appropriate tip for the android touchscreen . 
so i would not recommend getting this tunnel . 
the num_extend port doesn t charge samsung galaxy note num_extend num_num edition . 
save your money and just use your keyboard . 
i received it with in the specified time frame for delivery . 
certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it . 
stay away from her ,  and stay away from this toaster . 
zelda ,  has a better story and better gameplay . 
pros :  the product is great when it works . 
even then it has to be fit for purpose . 
the most important thing is that you get your calories in . 
i would not recommend anyone buy this cheaply made and packed bookshelf . 
only expect it to last for two months . 
the slide and the boot needed to be gorilla glued to stay on . 
i received these one day later than scheduled . 
out of six pairs i only have two left . 
the handset will not enable data access at all . 
personally ,  i like my lashes to look like .  .  . hair . 
use a usb one would be better than these pci cards . 
i purchased this system at a  bed ,  bath ,  and beyond  store . 
this should be short and to the point . 
if you have a smaller circumference around your knees ,  get this . 
i had this charger for over two years . 
this item comes with a stock hw  thin  battery . 
i don  think we will try this again . 
i have no idea if they are any good . 
even playing with the eq on my portable player didn t help much . 
it also doesn t work to just brush the front of any teeth . 
now i press and press and nothing happens . 
in that time this trap has killed no mice . 
i found that it did not work for me at all . 
try it if you have some extra money and you might enjoy it . 
i crashed after sliding out on a fast curve . 
with this mix up nothing works as it is supposed to be . 
to make sure ,  i tried several other chargers . 
i bot the  long  version of this short . 
the construction needs to be a bit better . 
that smell makes this product just to unpleasant for me to use . 
it would have become very expensive going through cans . 
i bought it because it is relatively cheap for a name brand tent . 
this is the second uncle mike s i bought . 
not like any other brown rice in the supermarket . 
either i got a bad batch or this doesn t work . 
i have to wear only my newer pairs with these panty liners . 
once it s doing this ,  it won t correct it s trim . 
they do not close properly and do not keep a seal . 
not worth the money and neon yellow pee  :   . 
i got this slow cooker a few months ago . 
there s only num_num mud arena . now ,  onto the girls . 
the idea is good and they do grip on ice and snow . 
on the plus side the texture is nice . 
instead ,  his efemminate counterpart ,  raiden ,  takes center stage . 
i ,  without exaggeration ,  own tights that are thicker . 
but ,  when you order something advertised you should get what you ordered . 
they added grip for my pinky and felt really good in my hands . 
the problem is these feel slimy and smell funky after a short time . 
it outlasted num_num minutes ,  but not by long . 
for maybe num_num minutes ,  then the screen goes black . 
i wouldn t say this is the best adapter you can buy . 
i tried it for five days sent it back . 
i think i ll give the rest to people as gag gifts . 
my am radio has more sensitivity then this unit . 
seriously ,  move along folks ,  there is nothing to see here . 
once there is a sea route you and the ai need harbors . 
wow ,  was this game a waste of time . 
this camera wrap asserts that it fits  or stretches to fit  most cameras . 
there are two versions of the german num_extend as evidenced by different markings . 
tried it with alittle water like zagg s invishield . 
with this one they just sit there wondering what the heck it is . 
and yes ,  i followed the directions to the letter . 
but ,  unbeknownst to me ,  some apps can cause blockers . 
this game would be better if it is a num_extend person perspective . 
do not expect these to be spill proof . 
and yes ,  the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others . 
well but with too much noise to keep . 
my guess that is due to the silicon in it . 
i have used this mouse for num_num months with my laptop . 
the stick is not varnished ,  so is rough on the surface . 
i remember loving mine ,  but this was such a disappointment . 
it only lasted me about two hours before i gave up on it . 
as it is ,  it s little more than a child s toy . 
almost all retailers handle problems for the customer . 
these are good in terms of protein and fiber . 
do yourself a favor and go with netgear right off the bat . 
before it broke it really does the job but beware . 
the set arrived with no animal parts printed on the pegs . 
i gave this product num_num stars because it stopped splatter . 
my pc got connected ,  but the wireless would not work . 
to me ,  anyway . this may not bother you at all . 
wind has no effect whatsoever on the ball . 
i gave her one to play with in an she sniffed and ignored . 
it has a sickeningly sweet smell that i don t care for . 
to be fair . only once is not a fair trial . 
cant really say any more about it than that . 
it s been a couple weeks and she still doesn t get it . 
obviously ,  i threw the rest of them in the trash . 
i bought one of these for my kid at christmas num_extend
the more i played the game ,  the less i liked it . 
there is a ton of lint and residue left behind . 
poorly made ,  very little padding ,  this is a useless product . 
mine stopped working about num_num months after the warranty ran out . 
few months and then ran into problems but was good while it lasted . 
the toy seems too heavy for her ,  and she is generally disinterested . 
i bought this because my hair is so frizzy and in tammed . 
lets say that the apc manufactured batter melts . 
the heel was to small and it hurt my foot . 
long shipping time ,  very low quality ,  bad otterbox immitation . 
there are much better tambourine toys out there that actually work well . 
if you re looking for a shooter like halo ,  try kill switch . 
for the price i paid i expected a decent quality product . 
the bubbles won t go away in spite of all the fixes . 
incredibly disappointed with both the product and amazon . 
would prefer made in the usa where there are better agricultural laws . 
one bag had a huge amount of nuts and barely any fruit . 
not what i expected at all !  nothing like the otter box . 
there are a few different brands of the liquid type on amazon . 
this is the num_extend headset i have tried . 
i use this everyday ,  it tore and wore out for short time . 
the kittens crawled in the hole and it fell apart . 
using a tvs chip on the input of the reg . 
received this yesterday ,  and today ,  everyone in my family tried it . 
too small ,  and appearance was not what i hoped for either . 
while the sound is good ,  the fit is terrible . 
do not let younger campers use this product unsupervised . 
i may give it to my sister and have her try it . 
locking mechanism fell out the first time i used this cap . 
they just weren t comfortable so i returned them . 
why couldn t they copy something good ,  like grand theft auto num_extend
this thomas makes no noises ,  not even a train whistle . 
the wiring peeled off almost the entire length of the headphones . 
i know i won t be buying from smartdisk again . 
it really makes me wonder if they are real carhartts . 
we watched as interesting plot threads dissolved into nothingness . 
the packaging was fine so i doubt they were damaged when shipped . 
i couldn t get rid of it fast enough . 
clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn t much to admire . 
this case was terrible ! very flimsy ,  very pretty ,  very useless . 
just buy a tube of mint toothpaste would be the same . 
possibly some of these out there are fraudulent products ?  hard to say . 
it was easy to use and easy to follow the directions . 
i bought this as a lightening deal for $
i am certainly glad i did not have to pay for it !  . 
now this isn t one time buy mistake but bought and replaced . 
when i turned on the game i thought it wasn t so bad . 
then i used nail tek again and they started peeling in layers again . 
a very disappointed boy after a short time . 
i found my answer but ,  it is not rosewater . 
i can no longer recommend the platinum xl . 
i didn t do anything wrong ,  this dye just sucks . 
i have good brushes and very light skin . 
this comb does not work on dsh cats . 
one hundred million italian mothers can t be wrong . 
got this few days ago everything work fine until few minutes ago . 
not right away ,  but after a little while . 
i keep wanting to give it another chance . 
the next day he bit the tail off in one bite . 
also ,  helmets tend to be harder to adjust and put on . 
the light is very large and is distracting . i was very disappointed . 
however ,  i cannot get past the lid on the carafe . 
dogs aren t designed to eat such high amounts of grains . 
i colored my hair black about two months ago . 
what tastes terrible to me might be great to you . 
the study came to the conclusion that msg was safe . 
i ordered this thinking the money was going for an animal rescue site . 
maybe that s why she doesn t have much interest in it . 
i would compare it to a hot cocoa make with water . 
something should be done about the miss information on the sizing . 
i got this for my teething four month old german shepherd puppy . 
i also don t like that it doesn t have a swinging door . 
it was so poorly packed that it literally arrived in a million pieces . 
i ve tried several carol daughter products ,  hated all of them !  . 
it is not at all a so called  chopper  . 
sure enough ,  the one i tried on itched . 
some of the other reviewers say this item has a weighted gauge . 
absolutely the worst silicone cloths i ve ever purchased . 
however today ,  num_extend months later  its totally burned out . 
i loved the workmanship and material the belt was made with . 
it nowhere near makes up for the lack of a decent control system . 
i would not recommend this product to my worst enemy . 
numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked . 
i m always looking for something to play as a family . 
my dog has not had a seizure since . 
feels like the blades are bending rather than maintaining a stiff edge . 
i can wear chaco and keen flip flop with no problems . 
the bag is easy to carry with it s handles . 
the only thing that fixes the problem is to power down the router . 
num_extend and playmer makes a much better grip . 
please save your time and keep scrolling to another product . 
didn t care for it but i think it is just personal taste . 
well ,  sorry ,  it just goes back to the main menu . 
still well made and would recommend for younger women or teens . 
only to find that the controller chip has almost no esd protection . 
it is hard to fasten all the hooks too . 
the  risk shots  feel gimmicky and not intuitive . 
can see ,  hear  very slightly  but feel the air flowing . 
but i would love to find something with the freedom to move more . 
so i ve wasted $ on num_num pieces of worthless junk . 
make sure you put all cable and plastic pieces back in . 
gameplay on the pc is very awkward and difficult . 
this item is more of a space taker than a necessary investment . 
even so ,  i didn t like the flavor of the coffee . 
this is what i did not want at all . 
i followed all the instructions and was very gentle with this item . 
maybe i ll find someone to give it to . 
i got these quickly ,  they look fine on the outside . 
i only wish i had realized the difference sooner . 
also you can only see whats up front . 
it smells nice enough ,  but really doesn t do anything for me . 
the price charged for this item is way overpriced . 
my ravenous chewer is a scrawny num_num month old labradoodle named rusty . 
it s hard to explain ,  but i just don t like it . 
eureka claims that this machine is  true hepa filtration  vacuum . 
i got them just to wear around the house . 
even with two cups ,  all i could taste was the ginger . 
i plugged my factory adapter into the same outlet and it works fine . 
i have been taking ,  and continue to take ,  a probiotic supplement . 
the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark . 
maybe they are just not designed for my style of foot . 
i purchased this product because it claimed to support the hp psc num_extend
as another reviewer said ,  the playability of this game is just silly . 
normally this size in carhartt fits me with plenty of room everywhere . 
when this unit goes off hit the brakes . 
i know my tilapia are feisty ,  but they didn t do that . 
i wanted to prepare for the rainy months . 
i guess you win some and lose some . 
bitter and a funny back taste i have difficulty describing . 
i ve purchased mirror screen protectors from different amazon sellers . 
didn t like the taste of this at all . 
i tried to change the speed settings it flips on and off . 
unfortunately we have num_extend jars yet to use up !  . 
if you are having problems with diarrhea because of this . 
i was shocked as i ordered new ones . 
save your money and invest in a quality product . 
it is also very difficult to get the sprayer on the cans . 
i had to wait weeks for it to arrive . 
unfortunately ,  you cannot trust amazon to ship you the right version . 
uncle mike s uses a plastic clip without any spring to it . 
just scores of poorly designed dungeons and a choppy and weak plot . 
also ,  the snorkel is not a dry snorkel at all . 
oh i will replace these items but not with any klipschs . 
i read the reviews ,  but i thought i d still try it . 
that being said ,  that s like the only good thing about it . 
i do not have high arches ,  more like medium arches . 
the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now . 
another issue is that the pressure switch is faulty . 
after reading the good reviews ,  i tried out this pci card . 
i ve never cried over a haircut ,  or even withheld a tip . 
i used it for over a month for under eye puffiness . 
i am so done with any eucerin products . 
it would probably work better on older paints . 
not good for baking ,  just for making toast . 
the problem i had with the case was the echo . 
i ve been saving for this lens for awhile now . 
i love otterbox and this case is probably perfect for many people . 
but given the history of elder scrolls ,  i highly doubt it . 
bought in jan num_extend put in portable phone that never gets used . 
however ,  i found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs . 
i will have to use clomid to induce ovulation until i get pregnant . 
i have allergies and found it to be too strong . 
guess what ?  the  nonstick  finish came right off . 
or ,  i should say ,  tried to mask the bad coffee flavor . 
and i have heard that the jedi have been nerfed a lot . 
please note that this process only works for the cordless precision controller for num_extend
sometimes it worked sometimes it go barely any hair . 
the compatability issues with xp service pack num_num are known and well documented . 
but not wat we expected out of a bose product . 
this smart phone is no longer made by samsung company . 
i wouldn t pay the price for it again . 
our num_num dogs both started itching like crazy after using this on them . 
your teammates are useless and will actually grenade themselves more often than not . 
it s in a cardboard box ,  just stuffed inside . 
i m very concerned about what will happen when my warranty runs out . 
i have yet to receive this mysterious driver  it s been two days  . 
sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work ,  sometimes not . 
to put it mildly ,  we do not like it . 
i love ginger ,  and it s a little much for me . 
i tried adjusting the string ,  but no luck . 
the top broke off after about num_num uses . 
this is an ok cage but not what i thought i was getting . 
we bought these hoping our pup would chew on them ,  . 
now ,  months later ,  it is pretty much destroyed . 
this thing is neat but just not functional . 
getting at spells goes through a multi level menu . 
using a petco rat manor for them num_extend together for one big cage  . 
there s a complete star trek encyclopedia of ship dimensions . 
i suggest to download it after you install daikatana . 
thank god i bought it from a store where i could return it . 
before trying this stuff ,  i was % satisfied with annie s products . 
i like both but neither actually grew my lashes . 
very cheaply does what it says it will . 
i also noticed that my product is old . 
i bought these expecting them to be a sure thing . 
i learned my lesson to never buy the grips online . 
took num_num application of gas to get the cork to come out . 
stay away from this one and get the berry flavors !  . 
so i just decided to take the hit and toss the thing . 
will not buy again i mean stale like rock hard . 
my dog loves playing ball but hates this ball with a passion . 
i ve got ablackberry bold ,  as well as an iphone num_extend
the item i received was ont exactly the one pictured . 
small as hell comes dull barely a handel . 
i had one it worked for a few months . 
not smooth and healthy ,  like the kinky curly line . 
but i don t think they re worth it in the long run . 
is that a rabbit ?  i think it might be a squirrel actually . 
the num_num little contacts get stuck after only a few uses . 
accessories :  mama cat ,  one gray kitty ,  and one white kitty . 
after i initially bought this item ,  i was thrilled with it . 
these are plastic sandals ,  and they seem cheaply made . 
and since the combat is boring ,  it s an excruciating experience overall . 
then i took one sip and couldn t believe my taste buds . 
but i guess i don t know what cool is . 
skimpy amount and the applicator is stiff and ineffective . 
i don t hate it ,  but i wouldn t buy it again . 
no sound break up ,  clean as a whistle . 
i wish they still made the old version . 
some of them leak right of from clear bottom . 
this version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven . 
when you clean this it spills all over the counter . 
after a day with very little use my headphones stopped working . 
this wireless headphone will not work with num_extend
i like racing to be honest not tag . 
i was very excited to use this product . 
i originally bought the num_num  at costco  because my num_extend fritzed out . 
better off spending a little more and getting a better product . 
i think it is ruining my hair  :   . 
otherwise pass it by on your way to a blizzard or sierra title . 
the actual structure and plastic pieces are fine and fit ok . 
all those artisan crackers and spreads are not really tasty . 
this is a great idea ,  but this device is completely unreliable . 
then i had trouble getting the stupid game to install . 
it s doable ,  but you really have to push in . 
i have played the original baldur s gate on the p . c . 
i would not recommend this wig cap at all . 
no special equipment other than a screw driver needed . 
luckily he was ok and didn t break his neck as he fell . 
no firmware update for this camera . the system error is the killer . 
i don t know what the heck everyone sees it this lenses . 
i had to work a num_num hour shift with these droopy underwear . 
gave the kong snake to my puppies last night around num_extend
maybe its just my preference but i did not like it . 
i have been using this in tea primarily . 
these patches are thin and shed and tear easily . 
it is well constructed and the setup and teardown is a snap . 
the ones that were still intact were a cute addition to treat boxes . 
i give this game a num_num out of num_extend
you have to push it in slow and about half way in . 
i got the extra length and it bent on me . 
this is the worst airpot i have ever bought . 
beware ,  they can be dangerous for younger babies . 
plus ,  the bottle leaks from under the sprayer when used . 
did i mention the balls come out within minutes of playing . 
i find this does not work as well as the original brand . 
my girls were so excited when we saw the box . 
i m leaving this review as a means to hopefully contact the company . 
product claims and user reviews will sometimes encourage me to try something . 
alright let me sum this up for you . 
my major complaint is how difficult it is to clean and fill . 
it may have been a weak num_extend battery . 
i treat my stuff like gold and cycle batteries properly . 
they were not horrible ,  but they were not worth the hassle . 
i cleaned the dust off the base with a pastry brush . 
they look nothing like the lincoln logs of eras gone by . 
this product was like spraying glue in my hair . 
there are places all around the case where it just dosent fit perfectly . 
overtuning and cracks during radio playback are a steady companion . 
other than the graphics this game sucks majorly . 
i got this filter with fingerprints on the lens . 
too bad ,  i had to but the other stuff !  . 
been giving it to other people and heard no complaint from anyone . 
i prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients . 
it s not like we have made this puzzle num_num times or anything . 
so ,  if you buy this ,  be prepared to return it . 
but i will not be giving these to him on their own again . 
i hate belgian waffles ,  because they are too soft and mushy . 
it looks like a retarded death star but it works . 
i will no longer buy anything under the ucreate label . 
so my lumbar area can really start to ache quickly and intensely . 
this coffee is dark and intense but without any character . 
it s that the tiny hole shape was one the hummingbirds disliked . 
my cats do not like this at all . 
i have nothing against china ,  i m just stating the facts . 
the core itself is also loosely woven and not very tight at all . 
i haven t encountered any problems downloading pics till now . 
the device was very small and the print was hard to read . 
low noise rating and poor quality amplified audio . 
it stopped working after num_num weeks of use . 
buy the baby grand piano by fisher price . 
most lego set fit well but this one just falls apart . 
it s not that there is anything wrong with the product . 
the shoe states that it is suede upper . 
something tells me long term use would involve some throwing of said device . 
this may be all natural but it doesnt work . 
but i won t be repurchasing any brand of st . 
needless to say ,  they are on their way back to the shipper . 
well i guess it depends on the person . 
toll free customer service on package diesn t work . 
my num_num year old radio shack optimus s sound much better . 
operation flashpoint looked interesting to me at first . 
then you will taste a true cup of rooibos made right . 
and changing the rating from num_num stars to num_extend
for num_num dollars less ,  you cant beat it !  . 
of course now i know why it s so cheap . 
so i m thinking this kimono is for little people . 
nowhere near something that some one with very fair skin could wear . 
it doesnt come with glue and its kind of cheap . 
i cannot accept this major defect and misleading description on this website . 
well i thought it would come like it shows in the picture . 
this num_extend player is no where as good as others on market . 
i ve heard other reviewers compare this game to dark souls . 
i bought this pan due to the reviews and the price . 
then to top it off my face looks no different . 
not comfortable and didn t feel safe for pup . 
so i had to dig it out of her mouth . 
it is possible that i was given a deffective pair to review . 
don t plan on being in the house while running roomba either . 
the headsets work great with a galaxy s and a blackberry . 
and ,  no i did not drop the lens . 
fundamental expectation of glasses :  to be able to see out of them . 
they taste just fine ,  they re just broken and crumbly . 
also found one defect in the sewing near the product . 
i m going to see if amazon will take it back . 
i ve been a duke nukem fan for a long time . 
when i counted ,  there were only num_num clips ,  not num_extend
i had pictured adding in doors ,  mirrors ,  etc . 
you really don t want this aparatus in your living room . 
ives moisturizer ,  as this did nothing for me . 
the music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game . 
even my pasta loving youngest child found it unappealing . 
wish i had been able to find another old le bistro . 
these may work in boots but not in your shoes . 
i followed the instructions precisely and this piece of garbage did absolutely nothing . 
very disappointed !  get like num_num sizes larger than your size . 
get the presto pro instead of this junk . 
i barely enjoyed the demo of num_extend for two hours . 
i feel dove is just trying to flood the market with products . 
heck ,  they even sell distilled water and white vinegar here . 
i have read reviews pointing to bad ballasts but i m no electrician . 
it died a terrible death in about num_num minutes . 
the blade was not straight unless it was tightened all the way down . 
the worst aspect of grand theft auto iii is the dreadful ambulance mission . 
and worse . imodium itself is good at what it does . 
this blue ant bluetooth ear bud is horrible . 
in fact ,  we practically have one of everything . 
but this biotin stuff is a waste of money !  . 
i ended up returning this crate for a few reasons . 
 see review on the ball jar wide mouth half gallon jars with lidss  . 
for the price ,  i m just going to throw it away . 
and to make matters worse ,  now my desk cradle stopped charging batteries . 
minute button works this time but the hour button does not . 
we have all necessary items needed for it to run correctly . 
i understand that what you pay is what you get . 
we set it as a regular routine for game night . 
it was a clear winner with my son . 
very disappointed ,  designer at fisher price should be fired !  !  . 
i don t like the way they look either . 
i kind of liked the sour apple but there was only one . 
even after a heating treatment to plastic part still would not stay tight . 
i then plugged it into my iphone which was reading % battery life . 
my husband is num_extend and wears a num_extend in pants . 
you may be delighted ,  or you may be disapponted !  . 
one thing is for sure; i m done with dlink products . 
it literally tastes like water that someone added a chocolate flavor to . 
vanicream num_extend offers titanium dioxide % zinc oxide %
it is uninspired and not motivating at all . 
even so ,  the telephone is still not loud enough to cause attention . 
the sneakers also don t last as long as they used to . 
i started off with the dose of num_num drops per gallon . 
it has a weird smell it it also . 
in reality ,  it has num_num settings; num_extend num_num and a little  dot  . 
not the usual corn taste ,  although it has some health benefits . 
so i do not really get the point of it . 
there was no html based information at all . 
this was my first pair of merrell shoes . 
they are meshed well to sound like real comments being made by announcers . 
i used the special plate but still heat melted connection . 
but ,  as luck would have it ,  the marketers won out . 
i purchased this knife in may of num_extend
bent it back ,  it sort of works now . 
dishwasher safe yet not for use with  rinse aid  . 
anyway ,  amazon replaced the set promptly and without hassle . 
i ll try the minoura next and see how that fares . 
it also looks a bit cheap in my opinion . 
my nuts arrived rancid and were not edible . 
i ve been through two of these so far . 
magical note blocks  series num_extend  japanese :  jump upon the musical num_extend
i won t use it ,  but it s not worth mailing back . 
it fits snug enough or maybe a little too snug . 
chia is an incomplete protein since it is missing few amino acids . 
when the problem is solved ,  the other items remain in inventory . 
it looks like a jar of gold sparkle went berserk . 
they would work for verified data about % of the time . 
they say the proof is in the pudding . 
would not recommend this if you have anything to do during the day . 
too bad this product did not work at all . 
dissapointing from this brand where usually i can expect better . 
sick one pice to the screen protector and lift with that . 
i was excited to try this flat iron after reading all the reviews . 
i wish they made them like they used too . 
i discovered that it still malfunctioned as described above . 
so i returned them and got the targhee . 
it will bunch under clothing and be uncomfortable for this reason . 
a good slipper for cold weather ,  and concrete floors . 
i ve been telling our reporters the same thing for years . 
i tried them on in a store and this size fit just right . 
i have friends and family who love tattoo goo products . 
the masks that are sent are not the ones shown . 
you might as well just eat sugar free candy . 
i spent an hour playing with it ,  adjusting it ,  etc . 
i use the roll on and it works quickly . 
you can go across the world ,  and play people in fake arcades . 
after i switched ,  the service still didn t work . 
i feared she would declaw herself trying to get them off . 
they would pause ,  tilt their heads ,  and bark even more . 
the second time i tried this it started burning around my nose area . 
i can t believe so many people gave this game high marks . 
i wish i could rate this product with num_num stars . 
i waited three weeks and my product still did not arrive . 
i am having trouble saying anything nice about it . 
she sings half the rhyme and stops half way through the rhyme . 
two of them in the last week alone . 
this game makes a mockery of th john carpenter classic . 
fuhrman instead ,  much better approach to weight loss for me . 
i did not need a full size back pack . 
so i got the organic one and followed the steps . 
personally i ve grown quite tired of supporting china s economy . 
i only used it for a couple of months then it was tossed . 
maybe it s too difficult to teach an old dog new tricks . 
atari thought so many people would buy the e . t . 
people have their own preferences in what they like . 
i have been using this since i got it . 
certainly my little boy wouldn t stop whacking it . 
i contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for ups . 
not a huge deal but wanted to mention . 
it is a very small serving ,  and it tastes terrible . 
however it constantly drops offline and the driver software is garbage . 
these particular modules didn t work in my num_extend powerbook num_extend num_extend
this wasnt what i expected out the oil . 
i now have an aqueon pro num_num on order . 
electronic controls are not intuitive and it circulates air poorly . 
i had to use padlocks to secure the front door . 
definitely do your research and stay away from these . 
my dog began pushing her bowl around in protest . 
i bought this waffle iron about num_num months ago . 
either i got a dud or the product is poorly designed . 
this was one of the worst tasting coffee s i have ever tried . 
the problem lay entirely with the mda s reception . 
i love wrestling sure ,  i love video games sure . 
i took it anyways ,  paying the price later when it rained heavily . 
the only active ingredient is trolamine salicylate which is a topical analgesic . 
strangely ,  it s currently twice the price of other places online . 
the release button just stuck ,  and wouldn t ever come out . 
analog hands must be set independently from time on watch . 
it was probably only a matter of time before it failed completely . 
for high end ,  i recommend mac matchmaster or makeup forever mat velvet . 
the adjustment knob kept moving and more importantly it s heavy as hell . 
the crown is very flimsy and brittle stamped piece of plastic . 
however ,  this product left my hair feeling heavy and thick . 
to me it tastes like salty cough syrup . 
this taught me not to chomp too heavily . 
i dont know why i still buy stuff that doesn t last . 
and num_extend lb weights and all were spot on . 
we have a few of these and none of the tops work right . 
i m afraid she will do the same with this . 
the only fun thing to do is develope your character . 
i suppose this mat is only for the original  plastic  num_num fountain . 
i hate being that way but that s the way i am . 
they didn t have a fancy for it either . 
inclusion of nutritional yeast to provide folic acid is essential . 
the broad base actually isn t a good idea after all . 
i was hooked on it until i realized what i was doing . 
the gears stripped ,  and i threw it away . 
so that s why num_num stars and not num_extend
besides ,  it was a pain in the butt to take off . 
plus ,  it is too small in size for the price . 
the product does as intended ,  but the lifespan is quite poor . 
after only one weeks usage this stuff produced a ridiculous amount of mold . 
i have used memorex without trouble until these printable to the hub ones . 
i owned three of these ,  the two plastic ones snapped . 
my son has had this toy since he was num_num months old . 
 seems to still work fine  it is amazing that this oversight was made . 
it s low in carbs and has lots of fiber . 
the configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery . 
there are handles ,  gaskets ,  and spare parts in many sites . 
i bought this product coz of the rating . 
i would not recommend purchasing these fans . signed , not happy . 
it was too large and didn t stay on . 
i wish this same effect would last all day . 
i have had one for years and love it . 
i am using the itrip made for the old model of ipod . 
shouldn t have to rework a toy quite so quickly . 
i hope everyone enjoys it but ,  i did not . 
mic worked the first day i used them ,  then stopped working . 
those earlier games must of been close to completely unplayable . 
this will hold up your iphone ,  but just barely . 
you have to continually press his feet to make him dance etc . 
i touched the side of my apc ups and it was burning hot . 
i actually didn t even open these because they were too small . 
i realize the package says to start them slowly . 
or the gmo soy and corn that everyone is talking about . 
the game doesn t last us very long playing . 
it s like putting your cell phone on vibrate to your face . 
it s all over in a matter of minutes seriously . 
with some design improvements they could be good . 
i like my coffee strong ,  and this wasn t a strength problem . 
might as well shoot though a lens cap . 
the tiffen created quite a few obvious spots and halos . 
using a cheapish lcd helps drive profit margins higher for kodak on num_extend
this is by far the worst knife i ve ever owned . 
i didn t like it and i would not buy another . 
but the operating system is terrible . the num_extend was much more usable . 
i replaced it with the country life vitamin . 
i really did not feel well for a while after my workout . 
i got it on auto delivery and i m cancelling that right now . 
fighters can take hits ,  but can t cure poison . 
it is so drying that i could only try it once . 
the boss made of bats is original and awesome in appearance . 
i thought i could live with the negative features but i can t . 
i have had this coffee maker for num_num years . 
and i can not find a list of authorized service centers . 
they re really just renting it to you for three years . 
when it arrived ,  the box was a bit mangled and wet . 
in this game it is just the opposite . 
so i decided to try this thing in order to prevent my snoring . 
its as loud as a large window fan . 
i was expecting more of a nude with peach tones . 
anyway ,  the biggest hassle came when using the dot popper . 
the water bottle top needs to be turned right side up to fill . 
for that reason i would not recommend purchasing it . 
the end result was that it quit working . 
i have demonstrated how to use this a million times . 
it looked like maybe it had melted or something . 
you have to order it seperately from creative . 
it was edible so i gave it an one star more than something . 
there is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in primal . 
just a waste of money unless you use it on a beginner bow . 
i take good care of my phone never let it drop . 
the boot was uncomfortable and not a boot i would recommend . 
it s not as if i was really that rough with this item . 
pharmanex strictly prohibits the selling of their products by this means . 
sometimes trouble getting it to come on and stay charged . 
i bought the orange concealer for dark circles under my eyes . 
the saves are spaced too far apart in this game . 
i guess for some people it simply doesn t work . 
so it was not as comfortable for me . 
only an experienced person in a local fish store can provide that information . 
what i feed them is very important to me . 
this tens does not put out enough stimulation to be useful . 
i m now wondering if they re still safe to ingest . 
she wouldn t even use it as a regular toy .

but this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast . 
couldn t dance my way faster to the bathroom and grab that douche . 
i can live with it but i expected better . 
also ,  the broadcast signal interferes with my home security tv system . 
avoid locations with tripping hazards ,  or little room to move . 
i found the fit odd and it was uncomfortable . 
it was much sharper than before ,  better colors ,  better everything . 
it s also fairly thick and difficult to spread around . 
the taste of the fuzzy navel is alright at first . 
you can t judge what s a large and what isn t . 
it lost the two stars because the edges will not lay down flat . 
i do not recommend this kettle !  i am throwing it away . 
even the strong stations had diminished signal strength in comparison . 
a year later another hose started leaking and i got another replacement .

the quality of construction is plasticky and exudes cheap . 
even my husband tried to position the can correctly and couldn t either .

you cant use the word quality for this iitem . 
sorry ,  i find it a dumb product which is not needed . 
any of these design with low prices works . 
i returned it and purchased something else for my dog . 
these are way too expensive and nothing like thornton threader floss for implants . 
it needs better directions on how to order the right size . 
i turned the printer off and back on ,  still jammed . 
i took the back off and reseated the digitizer cables . 
taste and texture were not to my liking .

you won t regret the quality or the health benefits . 
i m considering hanging it on the wall . my cats ignore it . 
seems this happened to a lot of units . 
i bought this the day it came out before the reviews came out . 
there are plenty of areas that lead to nowhere and wasted space . 
i ll stick to smelling myself and leave the gadgets alone . 
so keep your mind open and be willing to try many things . 
bought a nice toaster to replace the cheap one that had uneven toasting . 
do not buy it !  num_extend will look better without the case !  .

she still plays with them ,  but they look scary to me . 
and kodak sends you a refurb  which is even worse  . 
the collar was definately big enough for my dog . 
i bought a net gear router a few years ago . 
the num_num i gave it go towards quality and prettiness . 
overall ,  the cup and shorts are nice on their own . 
it just didn t cut it for the cats . 
i could taste the ginger and the lemon flavor . 
smelled great with that lime in there and worked as a beard wash . 
you really need to anchor the feather in better . 
i now have aantennas direct multi directional hdtv antennaand it works great . 
this does not tighten anywhere close to fitting the dovetails on a rifle . 
this is simply a very loud toy that makes fast ,  random movements . 
the picture posted looks bright red and compact . 
i stopped using it and my skin cleared up . 
it feels more like the stuff was just chiseled out of an iceberg . 
the cats like the mouse itself but it wont run at all . 
if anything they feel worse than regular strings . 
the part that fills palm making it hard to hold mouse or type . 
 it s officially part of the earthquake kit for now !   . 
it does everything that a mantle should do . 
it was supposed to be a pond toy . 
you are better off paying the money for a outter box . 
one cat is like a live wire and really needs to calm down . 
this is a defective product in my book . 
my hair used to be soft as silk . 
i wasn t the only one to have trouble in the elevator . 
this spray doesn t do anything ,  even after applying quite a bit . 
also ,  the openings were too small to fit the phone in easily . 
on top of that it works then stoppes working every num_num seconds . 
here s what i thought after a few hours of num_extend
they play a cute tune but they break in less than an hour . 
bough num_num to use to keep the smell of my snake tanks down . 
which to the best of my knowledge isn t good for any animal . 
i followed the instructions on how to set and then did my walk . 
i will never buy from this company again . 
maybe the italians will restore german quality to braun . 
i purchased as a birthday present for my kid who loves firefighters . 
this thing looks like it came out of a giant cracker jack box . 
i m sad they cost so much or i would just trash them . 
and i think you might just get my point here . 
there was yarn hanging from num_num of the fingers . 
the microfiber has already frayed back to the stitching . 
get the cobalt neotherm or the jager eheim . 
i am considering getting a hard cover for my samsung proclaim . 
the game is so unbalanced it s not even funny . 
i bought a monster cassette adapter for my wife . 
dont bother with this junk ,  especailly if you have carpet !  . 
this one is artificially flavored ,  so i m reducing my rating . 
the volume does not adjust very loud at all . 
i was so disappointed with this product when i tried it on . 
the taste was bad and the smell was different and lacking . 
i would have purchased harold or another train . 
now i m stuck with a whole bottle of this junk . 
tracking while moving in a vehicle and it can t keep up . 
i replaced the battery and it still doesn t work . 
i use bare minerals products and decided to try their mascara . 
if i could i would give this zero stars . 
by august the sound in one ear was cutting out . 
the reviews were all good so i splurged . 
it is by far the worst k cup i have yet experienced . 
there are no harsh edges to dig into your skin . 
second ,  we have noticed cracking in several of the blocks . 
i ended up sending it back for a full refund . 
the greek levels in particular are quite stunning ,  almost beautiful . 
i did not like this new feature at all . 
not good when you are trying to remove hot food from grease . 
the shirt doesn t hold its shape and the wrinkling is terrible . 
lastly ,  the box is just the wrong shape . 
it s also not any thinner than a normal one . 
sorry orijen ,  at this price you don t get a num_extend chance . 
i have to highly recommend paloma flats in general . 
i thought i was getting something better a piece of junk . 
my only recourse is to never buy from these manufacturers again . 
double check the web to see if it will work with your card . 
i reached into the amazon box and pull out the exomount . 
is it the best alternative ?  not in my opinion . 
the case is at a cheap price for a reason . 
it s nice and thick ,  but quite poorly made . 
it s bad enough to hear keith whine and complain every few seconds . 
good cold pack ,  elastic bandage ,  and num_num pairs of gloves . 
could never get this to do any good . 
it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale . 
when i read the positve reviews on this product ,  i ordered it . 
i had originally bought them via my amazon prime membership . 
plastic knob broke off after only three months . 
i wouldn t consider the nes version to be a classic in anyway . 
and the graphics look like a kid s coloring book . 
honestly ,  keep the level of difficulty at medium . 
the blade did come sharp and the steel is subpar . 
in fact ,  it irritated my sinuses and frankly just pissed them off . 
i will be returning this case and trying something else . 
i don t know if that was unusual or what was going on . 
i could adjust the static from barely audible to very loud . 
if you have sensitive eyes this is not for you . 
you re talking about almost num_extend fps  feet per second  from an num_extend
this makes the repetitive comment of your assistant quite appropriate . 
other than that ,  a waste of money for me . 
while the water tastes very good when first filtered tastes very good . 
i took this on a camping trip recently . 
this one is ok but not good enough to recommend . 
linksys  site doesn t even list the kvm as a product they sell . 
in fact ,  the cats are now marking the floor beneath the diffuser . 
ace bandage fit noted by one buyer is dead on . 
i do not recommend this rice cooker for anyone . 
as long as i can remember ,  i have been effected by winter . 
the body partially converts ala to epa and dha . 
i decided to try mxing a little with the oil ,  again nothing . 
i had bought this quite a while ago . 
i bought this thinking it would do the trick for my lab . 
i figured this product being organic would be good for her . 
now it only does the random shutdowns once a month or so . 
i tried both settings and it still does the same thing . 
this is exactly the same item i purchased at the $ store for $
also the ridges on it are somewhat hard and sharp . 
i may end up giving it to goodwill cause i suck at sewing . 
i love nfl blitz games except this one and here is why . 
these are about the size of a small rounded lima bean . 
would not recommend buying this product until they redesign or make it better . 
they have no flavor and are not palatable . 
this is less pods then the dark or med . 
my problem with them is why they re made so awfully . 
i am stuck trying to adjust the legs into the correct hole . 
glad it worked for some ,  but i will buy elsewhere . 
used as described and they didn t work for me at all . 
not sure if we will use all num_num cans . 
seriously disappointed in snowblind for releasing such buggy software . 
do not buy it because it s not worth it !  . 
i always buy regular sized toys for my dogs . 
they are big very big and built like a tank . 
probaby a mistake but at least he is enjoying himself . 
i think you can find tons of better rt strategy games . 
dont waste your money ,  this is nothing more than shaped scotch tape . 
the small piece that latched the bowl also broke on me . 
they sent a free coupon good for any glade product . 
i d hate to try to cram my feet in the medium width . 
the quality is something that should have cost $
my red button basically broke in num_num months . 
it s like rubbing glycerin num_extend most abundant ingredient  into your skin . 
please do yourself a favor and stay far away from kitchenaid . 
but it didn t turn me against sharpies as a brand . 
in the past i have tried boiling water ,  acids and plumber . 
it pays for itself after just one use . rating :  one star . 
went back to my old linksys and never again lost a connection . 
i am very disappointed ,  and will not use this bottle . 
for no reason at all while petting my small dog it went off . 
the phone goes haywire and pushed buttons my finger is no way near . 
normally ,  i play fps games on the hardest possible setting . 
the company was willing to replace but i didn t bother . 
i just want to say i know what ppm means . 
although it could be the texture of the food . 
hot pink doesn t sit well for a guy . 
after experiencing the real deal this is a disappointment . 
a good grip is an essential part of carrying confidently and properly . 
the rod came off the cheap little handle after only a few uses . 
i put it on and immediately washed it off . 
this is not mentioned anywhere on the item page description . 
i have found that the meow mix is more to her liking . 
changing the volume requires some force to get them to do it . 
the problem with this particular product is it s bar . 
there are two serious problems with this pepper mill . 
still ,  i wish the thing had worked right in the first place . 
i very much recommend you look for a different product . 
what i have heard there are great games out there for the consoles . 
i figured all japanese sesame oils are more or less the same . 
i have installed at least num_num other bike computers . 
the only thing you can get there is a brochure advertising their headsets . 
this is just not a very good game . 
i made sure to remove any plastic covers and upgraded the firmware . 
the back of the bra slides up continuously . 
i loaded it with memory to run high end business applications . 
i attempted a fix and hope it works . 
this is clunky ,  but at least it s transparent . 
spend the extra money and buy something better . 
these a big round bones with nothing on the outside . 
about num_num pm ,  another pole ripped through the top of the tent . 
why would someone ever buy this ?  i dont think its needed . 
the pants are thinner ,  the top is thinner and flimsy . 
it seems to be doing the job ,  i just prefer pellets . 
i rolled the dice when i bought this cheaper kvm switch . 
i put two diffusers in my num_num sf house . 
sounds amazing ,  until you see the base unit number of num_extend
i buy real essential oils ,  as well as the cheaper fragrances . 
they leaked from time to time while my son was drinking from them . 
it s hard to see the numbers on the display . 
the problem is it is stiff as a board in back . 
machine has worked sporadically and has now completely quite spraying . 
tried it for num_num days and my sandwich got wet every day . 
for what it costs ,  i expected a lot of positive things . 
it has a very rich smell to it ,  like chocolate . 
the candies are very sticky and individually wrapped ,  just like starburst . 
this is no more than a dollar store item . 
i also wanted to use wep encryption as before . 
my cat loves the nb reduced calorie but hated the indoor . 
the solution ended up in my eyes and mouth . 
you may find this to be your miracle product . 
not for aggressive chewers !  but he did have fun for a while . 
i d say they used it num_num times a week . 
now i m on a hunt to find a better moisturizer . 
the jack stands fell with nothing on them when i barely shook them . 
nope . verdict :  do not waste your money on this one . 
the function of a game is to amuse the player . 
these were great ,  comfortable ,  almost not there !  big shock . 
since it s a redesigned bike ,  my negative review is not applicable . 
i used it exactly as suggested and got absolutely no results . 
i got excited when i saw this in the tea collection at work . 
this brush set isn t really good at all for applying eyeshadow . 
fooled us this time ,  won t fool us again . 
we typically would give him eb at bedtime and vermont during the day . 
the leather on these sandals looks so flimsy and cheap . 
it fails in every way that a game can . 
i thought switching to this brand would save me some money . 
i used the towel trick again and it worked for two days . 
i returned the item and got my money back . 
perhaps i ll hide them in a large donation of healthier items . 
the chinese product that carol or the dr . 
penbo just wasn t a good choice for us . 
i am sorry to rate this with one star . 
ended up giving to niece and she doesn t carry it either . 
all in all ,  some parts of this game are great . 
let s get one thing straight first :  dogs love this stuff . 
even my new mesh tea ball didn t do much better . 
i tried to contact trijicon and all the customer service numbers are offline . 
i am still hopeful that eventually they will catch something . 
it also protects from uv just as well ,  if not better . 
i don t think i would ever buy this product on my own . 
i think the coloring is a real poor choice . 
it s not different from the original battery that comes in the phone . 
i d would have had to return this otherwise . 
getting the device out of the packaging was far from intuitive . 
i bought the num_extend and num_extend for num_extend and num_extend dogs . 
i got these because i am often bending down to wipe things off . 
after chucking two of the four i obviously felt i overpaid . 
it should not include messing up a whole foundation . 
after that it felt like something just fell apart inside it . 
however ,  i m still giving it some time to work . 
my spouse was not a happy at all . 
i am perimenopausal and have been for over a year . 
all of the reviews criticizing the design are correct . 
oh ,  there was bubble wrap around the screen protectors though . 
to be honest ,  the focusing of light wasn t that great . 
makes a lot more sense to purchase a water filter pitcher . 
i like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips . 
the entire side of the wheel was  crushed in  . 
hellens disaster after we read the product reviews . 
it can also be resharpened easily ,  or replaced in num_num seconds . 
it messures only num_extend long ,  num_num inches wide and num_extend tall . 
this looks like someones else s torn into present . 
it will not stay together it keeps coming apart . 
sent it back telling of problem and asked them to inspect before shipping . 
my husband actually used it to make cuts when installing a medicine cabinet . 
i just dream about how wonderful it is every time i run out . 
at least that is what the packaging claims . 
returned for refund to the store and explained it to them . 
i nearly fell off my chair when i saw that . 
i was diagnosed with type num_num diabetes in january num_extend
i had this for num_num years and used it about once a month . 
both for nestle ,  and for me !   :    . 
the gameplay  more like lameplay in this case  is the most important factor . 
this product from france was a big disappointment . 
back in num_extend i bought my first set of computer speakers . 
within num_num minutes my cat disconnected the entire wand from the mechanism . 
i tried heating it up longer but then it is too hot . 
i will write another review about it then . 
but i was upset most about the hinge breaking off right away . 
this package had num_num and used num_num of them before getting them aligned . 
product received fit neither the new nor the old part . 
audio had a buzzing and the voices are in a  fog  . 
this device does not have enough volume to be useful . 
this seriously didn t last num_num min before he had shredded it . 
would fall out and rendered the wrench useless . 
the tip keeps popping out if i set the power to high . 
this battery has num_extend while the sony has num_extend
it just sits in the corner of the yard . 
i selected this unit over other similar units because of the brand name . 
this product caused me stomach problems and had to send it back . 
the really strong point in this game is the sound . 
i never thought it would catch on fire . 
which is why cast iron cookware doesn t need any aluminum . 
it looked like black tar or melted black crayon . 
fine item if you have odd size pan . 
the game itself ,  however ,  is quite dull even to a toddler . 
we wiped them with wet paper towels to be . 
is there a way to not even give this products star at all . 
what is left probably won t last another week . 
will never never buy asparagus in a can again . 
the product is great ,  but the description was wrong . 
the small face and the design on the silver do . 
really pissed me off and threw away every piece . 
i ve used it several times and absolutely no difference . 
it would be nice for a ferret ,  as pictured on the box . 
i appeared to be what i was looking for  except color  . 
by the end of the game you ll have killed over num_num people . 
looks far better online than the real stuff . 
i love ordering clothes online but experiences like these hamper me . 
it had num_num tablets in it so you do the math . 
i must say i am very very disappointed . 
plus ,  wasn t too fond of the very citrus scent . 
but it doesn t do any of them very well . basically . 
also ,  the board has odd pictures for the letter . 
i was suspicious ,  when i noticed the surface was not the same . 
the spray mechanics also seems to be different . 
this is safe for pets and works; nothing harmful . 
too warm for me ,  but i have a tendency to run hot . 
i was at a loss and dthen i saw blue buffalo s wilderness . 
having to find a bathroom ?  what are we in the num_extend
this head phones do nothing that their ment for . 
i tried filling it below the water line and the same thing happened . 
if you can handle an at home peel ,  i suggest it !  . 
it took my husband to finally pry it open . 
the graphics were sure awesome but the acting was horrific . 
this led to more than a few dishes where my veggies would overcook . 
even with light use it is falling apart . 
after a few months they stopped accepting the charge . 
every other radio works fine ,  assuming i can find a good position . 
for the price i d think it would be good for years . 
it would be uncomfortable to sit on this walker very long . 
i find no need for stealth at all . 
so i know this is a red ring lens . 
it was hard to disassemble and made a mess . 
dog liked this alright but it immediately started to come apart . 
it s really a bummer ,  they used to be great . 
i agree with other num_num and num_num star ratings now . 
they just have different animations and even those aren t very impressive . 
but i m pretty embittered by my experience with the amaze . 
if you simply must own all sailing or pirate games get it . 
other than that ,  the cube seems the same . 
do not buy this game unless you just want gamerscore from it !  . 
mcdougal product ,  the amount of sodium is inexcusable . 
if you like cartoonish graphics go for the abbey or grim fandango instead . 
it s based on nonsense and the tablets have no active ingredient . 
stupid me just opened the package from a month ago !  . 
i received the mixer along with an attachment package direct from ka . 
the sounds are very good and draw you into the action . 
i am sure there are better products at amazon . 
that would not make it a deal breaker . 
i got this as a gym towel because of it s compactibility . 
body lotion should be at least creamy and this was not . 
might as well have left it in the box . 
i thought it was from some other facial products that i use . 
i think i hurt my skin after using this . 
these would be great if they were % cotton . 
this device did not live up to my expectations . 
not flattering for those of us with slim waists and small behinds !  . 
unfortunately i bought this router  aka junk  from amazon . 
the touchview app is clunky and has no way of exiting the app . 
although i still have an almost full tube ,  i have discontinued use . 
this was so gritty ,  wished i knew before i added ingredients . 
the picture should be changed to reflect the actual product received . 
makes me wonder what kind of  beef  they are shipping in to dry . 
just could not get used to the taste . 
i bought it to keep my dog busy . 
way too heavy caused breakouts after one use . 
be very careful about the size and fit . 
out in boiling water like instructions said but never really fits well . 
you can clearly see where the makeup has been applied to my skin . 
so mushy ,  salty and disgusting with a weird chemical taste . 
because this toy holds no challenges ,  she never plays with it . 
just get it right then time to take it off and wash . 
if i could give num_num stars i would . 
whenever it has all bars ,  it is fast . 
but i can t leave her alone with it incase she swallowed it . 
the park sticky patches out perform these for me . 
now i have to glue the board together . 
maybe a little quality control is warranted here . 
there was a coating but not enough flavor . 
my first attempt yielded a layer of rice stuck to the bottom . 
see if i can get a refund for it . 
they were a little tough and hard to chew . 
the sticky base part may not stand up to a lot of moving . 
i tried airing it up but no luck . 
neither me or my num_num year old are happy with them . 
this griddle looks great ,  but i had to send mine back . 
this chocolate covered strawberries bar was pretty disgusting . 
too bad i couldn t find that one again . 
they were narrow across the bottom so the stuff went out both sides . 
i would never buy anything form her again . 
being bed bound myself on fixed income i won t buy these again . 
is terrible and so is the voice acting . 
i guess others use this bra with a nursing pad . 
i am a size num_num to num_num if that helps . 
for learners ,  something less complex would be better . 
certain stages of the game are too quick . 
i literally cannot take one photo with my filter on . 
also ,  the nut securing the tensioner was missing . 
the quality of the video is t good at all . 
price is much cheaper than many other num_extend
also ,  i have been a fan off the ff seris until num_extend
i bought the game and the drm is causing problems on my machine . 
the price was outstanding and i was excited about getting them . 
pretty cheap but i only got less than a week . 
we would not buy one of their products again . 
i really like the idea of a breakfast cookie . 
majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not . 
and i ll probably look at the baggy short style . 
i thought this second headset would fullfil my expectatives . 
seems like i should be able to figure it out . 
the quality is good and i can see how some love these . 
it does have solid construction ,  and fits well in my hand . 
i should have realized that num_num ounces is not very big . 
it has buttons to control the music volume and skipping songs . 
i bought the keen sunport sandal for my num_num y . o . 
also this game makes fun of grand theft auto . 
if this fit very snugly ,  i would have rated it num_num stars . 
they need to relabel these or make them bigger . 
i won t recommend this product to people i know . 
coconut oil is actually good for you  thanks to dr . 
i went to walgreens and purchased a new med cuff monitor . 
the steel is only num_extend thick and bends horribly . 
maybe he s too young for it but he never plays with it . 
it didn t come undone ,  as if the screw was too loose . 
the reason ?  the white stuff at the bottom of each  frog  . 
it just gets a bit warm after wearing it for a long time . 
but don t buy this game expecting to be wowed . 
i returned this product within num_num days of buying it . 
i was never able to get this battery to work . 
i had to return this as it didn t work at all . 
was hoping for at least num_num minutes of chew time out of it . 
its sweeter and creamier and takes less to do the job . 
have used white noise and other sound makers for many years . 
she loves music ,  but this never caught her attention . 
they were quick to respond that it s likely defective . 
this is the old standard in inexpensive gates . 
its also runny and doesnt hold up well . 
they are a very generic  unisex  fit and absolutely unflattering . 
perhaps the motor isnt very strong and that is why . 
ill stick to teh premade double price or not isopure juice . 
i can t get the sound that i hear to be reasonably good . 
it died when i really needed it too . 
the scent itself isn t worth the usefulness of the cream . 
the cuffs dig into my ankles causing major discomfort . 
there s controller assignments in driving ,  walking ,  visual and menu modes . 
after num_extend months of wearing these flip flopsbottom line . 
tried this because of the excellent reviews but i didnt feel anything . 
i bought this as a gag gift . zack morris called . 
yeah ,  i followed the instructions provided ,  they were simple enough . 
the product is buggy and does not work anywhere near as advertised . 
i ve been through that before and wanted to avoid another wasted venture . 
replaced it with bissell s little green spot cleaner  see my review  . 
i don t have big calves ,  and yet these are snug . 
they have had no fun with them at all . 
i call laserlyte and told me to ship it back . 
if i could give this a num_extend in every category ,  i would . 
you can t even find something by looking up the manufacturer online . 
these are natural peach slices that are freeze dried . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
if you have dwarf hamsters ,  avoid this stuff . 
i know french roasts are strong ,  but this one was overpowering . 
the plastic on my console shifter indicator also turn blotchy . 
i smelled it first though to make sure it wasn t rancid . 
it is cordless and the battery works just fine . 
i think i have finally given up though in using this liner . 
this is not the case with digital cameras . 
not a fan of it at all ,  sent it back . 
but hey ,  maybe i m just a really smelly guy . 
the photo suggests something reasonably substantial for protection . 
it reminds me of another konami num_extend launch game ,  zone of enders . 
i found two major flaws in the tent . 
had i known how heavy they were i would not have purchased them . 
each fighting style has different moves and different button combinations . 
nothing wrong with that since overall she is very healthy . 
i don t like the consistency of this product . 
i ve put on a few screens in the past . 
we had ordered this for our daughter for her phone . 
i could not get the heating pad had ,  or even warm . 
man i hate to be the one who gives num_num star reviews . 
it holds my foot away from about num_num inches in the back . 
the rio karma is the best portable audio player period . 
these shipped fast and are true to size . 
i tried this and i don t like it . 
pitches that are off center have significant side ways pitch back . 
it has a lot less alcohol in it . 
i handed the stuff over to a guy friend . 
now i use bodyglidebodyglide advanced technical formulato put between my toes every day . 
i had bought a round one a few weeks before this one . 
plus i ve never heard of sunpentown  the manufacturer  . 
i bought this case for my iphone num_extend
we have used the fruit and tweezers for other activites . 
it is too strong and a little unappetizing . 
i m buying another one of those for when his friends come over . 
spend a few more dollars on something that actually works . 
these smaller litter boxes are just too short . 
part of this brand new box showed signs of wear and was discolored . 
luckily ,  we only needed it for a few days . 
if i was really thirsty ,  i d chug some of this . 
no way to organize the clothes at all . 
this one is just an ugly color in my opinion . 
the door isn t level so it doesn t close all the time . 
after a few uses ,  the rocker switch broke . 
instead of meaninglessly spending money on this title purchase kingdom hearts . 
i didn t realize it would be so small . 
our container lost all its water in just over an hour . 
i called tech support and they said download here . 
the original phone was less than num_num months old . 
so i am not too sure how can i rate this product . 
he wasn t even pulling very hard at the time . 
it seems like a hard thing to mess up ,  but they did . 
now that i think about it ,  they both have oil in them . 
i still needed to take photos so i bought a second one . 
it takes a few seconds for the color to appear after you color . 
though i had enough weapons to supply quite a large army . 
therefore ,  the oxo lemon zester is not worth the expense . 
it didn t do anything to my skin one way or the other . 
i don t know how i can make the music louder . 
and it depends on how i dry it . 
it definetly reduces underarm wetness by atleast %
i ve used this product for years with success . 
then it took extreme pressure to get to load . 
so i don t know if it is good or not . 
sony has num_extend recording while these have num_extend recording . 
i ended up giving them to a friend who wanted to try them . 
they don t shape well and get stuck to everything . 
kept in the fridge ,  it keeps for a good long while . 
but it raises blood fructose which is worse . 
when removing nail polish ,  soak part of a cotton ball in acetone . 
but what do you expect when they slapped it together so quickly . 
i was disappointed because it was quite expensive . 
then i looked closer and saw a sticker that said made in china . 
i ll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . 
please take into consideration this phone is num_num years old . 
this do not taste like equal at all . 
but the problem lies when you apply it on . 
i took the vitamin and could taste it for hours later . 
seems like it is part of the design . 
i would have thought canon would have made a better quality product . 
the little apple and cinnamon flavor to the blend is worth one star . 
the software supplied is also a bear to work with . 
i think for the high price they should hold up better . 
but when you lay down with it on it gets too hot . 
i did this twice just to make sure i had applied enough . 
it felt uncomfortable on my skin and didn t blend very nicely . 
we own the big brain academy ,  the brain age and this one . 
i feel this food is to blame for his severe uti conditions . 
pressure should be only lightly applied to achieve maximum benefit . 
the top housing does not come apart for easy filling . 
i am going to have to throw the whole bag away . 
the deerskin is considerably nicer leather than the cow hide i also bought . 
this is thinner than a handkerchief i believe . 
i agree with many here ,  it is slow as hell . 
obviously it does because others have posted positive reviews . 
i m shocked so many people like this game . 
i hope it didn t run away because we said it sucked . 
this ,  however ,  is a very lame follow up . 
most of their toys are made in china now . 
well this is a farcry form any good game . 
they went far past my wrist which i did not need or want . 
used it twice and both times it was just disgusting . 
i applied this salicylic acid treatment almost nightly to any acne blemishes . 
it sounded like the music was playing in the other room . 
that s because those three are even shallower than the main compartment . 
just make sure it ships within the us of a . 
i think i received a close to empty container . 
i will say that i didn t like this one at all . 
they are the wrong clips and will not fit my gun . 
i ended up doing a % water change and changing the filter . 
in fact the salt drowned out any of the other flavors . 
not a bad product but i would not purchase it again . 
however ,  these only burn at num_extend on both of my burners . 
no explanation for why they weren t sending the container ,  no apology . 
after getting used to it ,  you can make do . 
now own two sets and will be buying another for my cabin . 
i use to love this product before they changed it and the container . 
the first time i did it after a shower . 
i am going to have to try something else . 
there are num_num prongs that hold the lid on the carafe . 
this case is not user friendly @ all . 
don t put anything of any weight in this as it will rip . 
i put the thing in the garage to avoid the smell . 
my car has blue tooth so the latter is less of an issue . 
i buried it in the trash where it belongs . 
it seemed to get a little worse each time i bought new blades . 
mixing it into food just made her reject the food . 
i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess . 
the cover is very flimsy and covers several large squeaker units . 
i love thestarmark treat dispensing pickle pocket for dogs . 
a minor complaint for several reasons ,  but still bothersome . 
yuk !  this used to be very nice coffee . 
the nisson cup noodles tasted much better and were even cheaper . 
i find this eyeliner to be a huge waste of money . 
i m going to replace it with something more stable . 
nor did the picture show it in the ordering process . 
the graphics look amazing but that s the only plus . 
prior to it stop working ,  i would have given in num_num stars . 
it gets the job done just not well . 
the large flying squirrel lasted about as long as a real one would . 
i purchased two of these kettles as i m a big tea drinker . 
too expensive for not doing its job right ,  by my standards anyway . 
i am very pale with freckles and i always burn . 
mu hair was one wool ball ,  mushy ,  and thin . 
the npcs do not show much life either . 
not a big deal for me ,  but just be aware of that . 
very disappointing ,  but we had to ship it back . 
this one i rate as you live and learn . 
seriously ,  it s not difficult ,  per se ,  just annoyingly cheap . 
i think the swiveling handle is the culprit . 
i ended up giving them to the friend who recommended i try them . 
that is due to a not just tapered ,  but pointed top . 
agreeing with the same reviewer ,  i could not stomach this stuff . 
he is about to finish up that num_num pound bag . 
i have come to expect illy coffee to symbolize good and consistent quality . 
i decided to take my chances with caution . 
num_extend networks are ten times faster ,  even on reliable networks . 
have yet to find on which will work with windows num_extend
the chuckit glow ball is a little harder . 
i had to walk my bike home twice with these . 
too bad ,  because i have always liked bass . 
simple solution you have a great concept but way overpriced . 
unless you enjoy disappointment ,  avoid this game at all cost . 
the only words that comes to me is ,  ugly tasting brown fluid  . 
but after transporting and reset ,  i found them to be junk . 
do not wasit your money on this junk . 
i decided to upgrade to this gain antenna for increasing signal strength . 
it works with the included software and the base memory only . 
i should have paid attention to the reviews on this bra . 
i found this to be at once too salty and too sweet . 
but they forgot to account for actual buyers . 
this game is a complete waste of time . 
i hope one of my kids becomes a podiatrist . 
i ordered the one that requires only num_num pill each time . 
they are super cheap and work just as well . 
i bought these when my son was maybe num_num years old . 
i wanted delicate and these were big strapping straps !  loli returned them . 
he much prefers the  tastations  and  whiskas  treats . 
shame on mega bloks for selling such an incredibly poor product !  . 
no where to go ,  no where to hide . 
then ,  out of the blue ,  the transmitter just died . 
you really want to be rubbing that on your face ?  trust me . 
they are a nightmare to apply and this one is no exception . 
wouldn t feed them to any living thing on the planet . 
the plates are made of plastic and look like it . 
i use a camelback for single track and rougher riding . 
i ve had these from other sources and they are chewy when fresh . 
that is not a feature ,  that is a warning . 
i bought this because of the high customer ratings and reviews . 
i maybe lost two legitimate games out of the seven . 
the same style in the danskos fit just right . 
i had to return it for a refund . 
the only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is . 
the battery is brand new and barely used . 
worked great for num_num week ,  then it just quit . 
this is a poor excuse for a cage . 
clipped one nail on my num_num pound doberman and the thing fell apart . 
i felt like it didn t have a very good range of volume . 
the boot was huge ,  the material looked like plastic . 
it doesn t work with any of the htc phones i tried . 
its up there in the worst quality control of anything i have purchased . 
for reference ,  i have long ,  thick ,  smooth wavy asian hair . 
my hair tends to be very dry and prone to breakage . 
experience has taught me harnesses do not really work . 
it was very nicely made though for the price . 
dried fruits without sugar would be fine num_extend
on a known course ,  it was off by %
it wasn t left with any moisture near it . 
i quickly purchased an otterbox product  relex model  as a replacement . 
your character has no real importance in the num_extend
i tried the num_extend because of the reviews . 
these spendy cards will not all run the game well . 
i rinsed them off and they tasted fine . 
the addition of animal digest should make any dog owner s stomach turn . 
i love designer skin products ,  but this one needs to go . 
the only thing going for this machine is the ease in cleaning it . 
i recently sold it pratically brand new for $
this says skill level num_extend age num_num and up .  .  . lies . 
the little plastic bar above the volume buttons broke after a month . 
i clean the areas before and after placing their food down . 
i can t stand this cereal now ,  it s revolting . 
i haven t contacted the seller and i don t plan to . 
wired connection works fine for several hours ,  then drops . 
so maybe we did get our money s worth all things considered . 
whatever it s supposed to do ,  it s not doing it . 
this made them marginally suitable for the intended use . 
after num_num plays ,  at least num_num of the hippos gets stuck . 
this is not a good product at any price . 
you only get one try to correctly align the adhesives . 
i am sticking with clearasil deep pore cleansing mask . 
the pegs are cute and colorful and it s mostly wood . 
even the package is a joke; says num_extend when there are only three . 
amazon was good and i was able to return . 
i will be reluctantly moving to logitech for my computer speakers . 
my kids will eat them but they don t ask for them . 
this is one of the worst games ever created . 
i give this winchester knife two stars out of five . 
returned the product to amazon and got a replacement . 
the actual case has cut outs along the whole top . 
i have reflux and coffee is a major trigger . 
i never use a toner and proactiv comes with toner . 
i ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product . 
the humidity buildup in this thing is way out of proportion . 
don t wear this to work for the love of god . 
it worked for a day or two when i first got it . 
a num_extend charger is supposed to be able to charge at num_extend
what arrived was nowhere near the color or color family . 
that is the only way i know how to describe it . 
as i said before i was not impressed in the least . 
the device would connect fine but would act rather weirdly . 
for the price ,  i m not going to send it back . 
the bags outer and interior materials are cheaper too . 
i cannot get my hat in to this net it is so small . 
looking at the label it does contain num_extend of  sugar alcohol  . 
i see a lot of kids writing about the psp . 
and you don t need a harsh bristle to clean an air gun . 
right when i opened it i noticed the poor quality . 
secondly ,  you re showing prices to begin at num_extend
i can afford to replace runners but not a carpeted room . 
but the bags come back so i spray again the next day . 
i did not have a problem with that aspect of the set . 
both dogs walked around it to avoid it . 
let s face it ,  espresso is not for the casual coffee drinker . 
took it to an authorised luminox agent and of course no warranty . 
this hartz maximum protection puppy pad is disappointing to say the least . 
do not waist your money on this item . 
it only slightly mentions red faction a couple of times . 
i would have been better off just getting one of those toy bars . 
he then complains about it and runs away . 
just couple times using it and it s foggy . 
while this adapter  works  ,  it has two serious flaws . 
like the say if it s not broken why fix it . 
unfortunately ,  i couldn t reach greenworks to save my life . 
riding the horse is tough with the hand held controls . 
but the itching was enough to consider returning them . 
it s very expensive and let s face it ,  sugar is sugar . 
the dobi design ultra compact mini tripod stand worked better for me . 
if she itches she turns red ,  then she scratches her hair out . 
i do not plan to wear the sweat pants on my chest . 
sadly have to give it num_num star due to such poor durability . 
out of curiosity ,  the plate was reattached and removal was attempted again . 
even though she enjoyed it the one time it did work . 
because of this i couldn t really feel for much of the characters . 
do not buy these headphonesthey look nice ,  but the sound is muffled . 
if you buy one of these ,  you are rolling the dice . 
am now looking for a better model as a replacement . 
it took more than an hour to charge barely %
maybe i am used to my other bras with more fabric to them . 
coming from a voyager num_num and a voyager pro its a real shame . 
if it s sunny and cool this is a good hat . 
this shoes are too small for my husband . 
will stick to purchasing this type of stuff at store . 
the mount fits my nexus s just fine . 
to my knowledge ,  no one had attempted to discourage the pulling behavior . 
and this is my second one ,  both with the same result . 
i thought it maybe normal until the num_extend use . 
save your money and pass on this product . 
this isn t even worth opening out of the box . 
i use this plug now as a back up . 
many preschoolers will be bored before they even get started . 
looks dirty and have to rub it clean . 
my hands and pot holders turn gray when i hold the pan . 
i had to buy another orion ez finder deluxe . 
it is extremely light with a very comfortable band . 
for some users  update the prl  seems to do the trick . 
another year in development could have maybe turned this around . 
i did it exactly num_num minutes and rested num_extend
junk made in indonesia apparently by unemployed rubber plantation workers . 
pro :  it connects to the cd slot solidly . 
your use of excessive adhesive is uncalled for . 
i bought this lantern for a cave exploring trip to peru . 
will try the extreme line next and hope for better results . 
get the digital one or the one with temperature guage . 
i think a shade or two lighter might have worked out better . 
also the yellow color on the clays seems like added paint color . 
it vacuums carpets nicely but is hard to handle . 
yes the belt was tight ,  wet ,  positioned properly etc . 
this thing didn t even last a week before it stopped working . 
i have other shadowline gowns that i adore . 
the covering on the seat should be made of a more durable material . 
next time ,  i ll avoid this brand of bully sticks . 
i ordered to wear with my thin bras . 
one i could carry my cell phone in my shirt pocket . 
or at least let us use rechargeable batteries . 
that in itself was a clue to a bigger problem . 
under the light i can see their shinning . 
it s pretty and i guess fine for a small cat . 
however ,  my cats both developed a persistent cough for several weeks . 
i have to agree with others on this one . 
too think to fit your iphone if it have protective case . 
i have a flat piece for my galaxy num_extend
that one helps keep my break outs at bay i think . 
as a consumer ,  i rely heavily on amazon reviews . 
i bought num_num of these to do double turning . 
i m not joking when i m saying it burned my hand . 
the design is clunky and heavy on your ear . 
i want a refund ,  plus an hourly wage . 
i had no red marks and didn t break out in any rash . 
i hope in a real situation it pinpoints my location exactly . 
i have no idea if it protects with the rfid . 
the enemy ai is comparable to goldeneye for the num_extend
worked for a sum total of num_num hour and num_num minutes . 
found the ring is too low and hard to adjsut the scope . 
i am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had . 
i read the reviews before i bought this product . 
i put it on myself once and that was it . 
the simple answer is to turn your bluetooth off on your phone . 
also not happy about the leather loosing color after just one season . 
but watch him make decisions !  his words are extremely precise . 
both units have been rendered useless for their intended purpose . 
no one really likes the depots and their addition to the game . 
those num_num dollars are not going to the right places . 
first of all the pump did not work . 
but it s still not safe from thoughts of trashing the rest . 
this is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable . 
it did work well and kept my liner and shadow in place !  . 
my feet are badly calloused from the poor support of these shoes . 
is it for kids ?  if you want them to be bored . 
we purchased this for our gerbil to have . 
the directions say one shot per each num_extend of water . 
now you have to stay alive using your  survival skills  . 
took forever for the tadpoles to reach frog status . 
why pachmayr doesn t include a $ screw is beyond num_extend
my main problem area is the crown of my head . 
none of the reviews i saw on amazon addresses my challenge . 
i really like ginger and found it far too strong . 
true ,  the nintendo ds has been selling very well . 
with other flavorings ,  the harshness is muted but still remains . 
i ve never dropped the phone and always treat it nicely . 
ball is small so they tend to throw it at the pins . 
i have no reason not to believe her . 
this turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be . 
i added about % water to make it workable . 
i simply can t say enough bad things about the animation . 
ok i purchased this unit and it worked for about one month . 
i love them and they have just the right amount of everything . 
item is wonderful for someone who is a narcissist . 
i bought these for my mother who is short with heavy thighs . 
the controls take a little time to get used to . 
the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading . 
even after stretching them out ,  they are way too painful to use . 
i won t recommend this product to anyone of my friends . 
a little scotch tape and they worked fine for over a year . 
and lock them to the cable lock inside the luggage . 
i ordered a few other things ,  then proceeded to checkout . 
what i got was more of a triangle shape . 
two hits from them was enough to kill me . 
my expectation was entirely different than the product . 
i m just not loving this case at all . 
i used it outside and the weather didn t cause it to deffect . 
i didn t notice any change in me after taking this . 
i tried but did not have any luck at all . 
i ve never seen such strong elements in an overall pretty lousy game . 
well it was not what i was expecting . 
you might find yourself never playing it again after you hit a roadblock . 
they are kinda baggy and ride down in my shoes when i walk . 
i gave this food to my num_num year old airedale mix . 
when i opened the package i was severely disappointed . 
i had num_num of the glasses in pieces when they arrived . 
just a  click ,  click .  and now the taste test . 
i will look for local suppliers in the future . 
i was excited to give these a try . 
i sent this back and ordered the otter box armor . 
the door would not stay closed as the plastic had warped . 
i will avoid this brand altogether in the future . 
i would suggest that you check reliability ratings before buying this drive . 
the swiffer seemed to pick up a lot of the dust . 
i ll report back after trying it this way tomorrow . 
sorry people ,  there is no cheap way out of this one . 
bought these to tie up the wiring in my truck s topper . 
they don t hesitate to cut off your line anytime . 
i may try another flavor that is more pure with the ingredients . 
a better choice would be almost any of the sennheiser mx series earphones . 
the way the pad attaches to the buffer is a cheap velcro system . 
but ,  none of us are excited about eating another bag . 
it came in the flat case ,  and that case is broken . 
im hoping they will go . not using this now . 
i m talking about a num_extend x num_num road tire . 
i installed two of these cards on my mom and dad s laptops . 
so this goes into the wasted purchase pile . 
because i want to punch them in the groin . 
i am disapointted with panasonic because this product . 
my brother has one of these and thinks it s great . 
shame on amazon and on the supplier ,  house of nutrition ,  inc . 
think about your child s tastes before buying this lovely ,  durable toy . 
the qa people at netgear must be shot . 
i played with it for hours and it never died . 
don t know what else they want me to say . 
cracked the first time the lid was opened . 
more than likely this is the real thing . 
this would certainly not be an item i would want to purchase again . 
i can t imagine what the small looks like . 
if i add more grounds it doesn t taste any better . 
there s also less functions in the game as well . 
used for my sensitive stomach num_num year old num_num lb . 
very disappointing for an appliance that is supposed to have a good reputation . 
i would not recommend it for multiple uses . 
there is no point in making a  dress up puzzle  . 
she uses only the powder form so ithought she be okay with it . 
also worth noting that it no longer works on my sony vaio either . 
this case was really weak and was not what i was looking for . 
the first time out the plastic connecter for the two paddles cracked . 
this game is very short you can finish it in a few hours . 
the problem is it simply did not work . 
it s the grossest game on the market and totaly uncalled for . 
it may be i just received a defective one . 
 see updated info below cons : the brush is too soft . 
the charging cradle is very usable and the headphones are a comfortable fit . 
maybe others will find them useful ,  but i hate them . 
i bought this for my little num_num lb . 
it just gives me a headache every time . 
urine turns into a clay clump i can hardly scoop out . 
it is very light weight and compact compared to the earlier versions . 
but you ll need the vulcanizing patch kits for a road tire . 
it was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn t working for me . 
however ,  i was soo disappointed after opening the boxes . 
you can do kegals and strengthen your pelvic floor without these ridiculous balls . 
why ?  because ,  you have no free will in this game . 
the inside is big enough for one steak or two petite cuts . 
other than that shipping was great and no other problems . 
 i like the civil war for num_extend too  . 
last ,  the stretchy material is just not sturdy enough . 
it kinda tastes like caramel ,  but it doesn t . 
discovery by the windows wireless manager fails a num_extend
maybe space for a cell phone or an num_extend player . 
the canon supershot num_extend is does not have an af illuminator . 
so bad you ll swear your gba is possessed by a demon . 
the ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type . 
and it dried my hair really out a lot . 
you don t even need a fast computer and everything will be smooth . 
you should probably advertise it just for dogs . 
the graphics are quite simple and the music is extremely limited and dull . 
arrived quickly however the curler is too small for my eyelash width . 
but poor  execution  in all departments  kills  any chance of fun . 
just because something is expensive doesn t mean it s quality . 
i ordered these belts because it said  genuine eureka  . 
they cannot handle the movement of the num_num month gsd puppy . 
linksys  web site does not even list version num_extend firmware . 
after that the rest of the rubber began to fall apart and crack . 
the fit is just down right in the toilet . 
i thought for the price that these weren t that great . 
if you like this feeder ,  consider alternatives from other brands . 
after num_num months ,  we finally received an  upgrade  . 
perhaps with smaller cats  with smaller waste  it would work better . 
needless to say ,  i returned the phone for a refund . 
the catch just moves around and doesn t extrude anymore . 
i rented the play station one just for fun . 
i hope that whatever is causing it ,  gets found out . 
you might as well eat the box it came in . 
i think this would be my only purchase . 
it also claims to provide exceptional razor glide but it does not . 
disappointed that this can t be used safely with my canon num_extend
i do not recommend this product at all . 
went corrupt and i lost very important pictures . 
my poor dogs had diarea for several days . 
only improvement seems to be that they went to a micro usb charger . 
scratches or not the machine paused on every dvd i played . 
but on this one there is a big ol  piece of plastic . 
i would not recommend this version of the game . 
spend the money on a better head set . 
each space marines has different attacking range from num_num to num_extend
i see no improvement after using this cream . 
it s a solid piece ,  however never mounts correctly . 
unit failed on second use ,  with lid melting into base . 
upper rest is too high even at it s lowest setting . 
he does not generally need things read to him for comprehension . 
there are other similar products on the market that work . 
once they learn it ,  there isnt any real learning left to do . 
interestingly the replacement had a metal belt clip . 
was sent small ,  needed large ,  they didnt ave large . 
num_extend is far too geared to tanks and planes . 
i tested this one with the macys one and one from sephora . 
a lot of apps are available for it . 
this thing is the worst investment i have ever made . 
please be aware this is not a j . a . 
ok so i am editing this january num_extend
i try to review impartially and only after using whatever is reviewed . 
i will add this to the list of failing eyeliners . 
this product can go back to where it came from . 
i ll take my chances with legends of wrestling . 
and very frustrated that it wasn t a liquid . 
it is years dated and uses nothing of the num_extend power . 
i use headsets a lot and have never had one snap on me . 
 it is the last ingredient on the long list of num_extend
first time out of the box i plugged it in . 
the rest of the bag was full of jerky bits and crumbs . 
the surface was scratched up within num_num days . 
you squeeze two parts together and something else pops off . 
i hate to say it ,  but i m disappointed in this game . 
my hair is normally very soft ,  has  fluff  and bounce to it . 
did not impact usability so i didn t care . 
the sides of this relatively costly case are peeling off . 
i did this for probably a month or more . 
if you want a circular polarizer ,  get something nicer . 
but for the price it s neat to have on the shelf . 
oh and absolutely no problem returning for refund !  . 
we ll just have to watch out for ourselves !  . 
and since it s discontinued there is no support either . 
thinking about trying out the platinum tools crimpers next . 
if it wasn t for the drm i would give it high scores . 
every single person that purchased this piece of trash should have their money num_extend
for the money ,  the consumer ought to get a lot more !  . 
best of all ?  it s quiet in comparison to the epicurean . 
we have found out it s something to do with the bowl . 
kinda hard to sleep when the alarm is always going off . 
my husband said they finally just gave up on it . 
there are already two expansions for the sequel . 
tuli s heavy duty gel heel cups ,  didn t work for me . 
now it is my phone s primary live id . 
boys used num_extend since christmas and we haven t had it out again . 
it looked like a used case sold again as new . 
the next step up to a flying joke is being a pirate . 
this game was built using a graphics engine that was outdated even in num_extend
the first thing i did was to remove the air restrictor . 
i m really surprised to see such positive reviews for this product . 
i bought two of these bras in the large size . 
then they said i should contact coby directly for help . 
i have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol . 
the game itself ,  while somewhat neat looking ,  was ridiculous . 
it said to go to their support web site . 
the doors of the cabinets close well and can hold accessories . 
if you have misgivings about magnesium stearate ,  don t buy this product . 
not good for any pet ,  i got it for my chinchillas . 
i would recommend getting a sample of this before buy . 
put some tools and a spare tire in there and closed it up . 
caveat emptor :  this company does not seal the boxes in any way . 
bose replaced it even though it was a few days out of warranty . 
it is hard to see the screen with this protector . 
yes !  i heard you the first time ,  thank you . 
good chew to the noodles but the sauce was just sour and bitter . 
i haven t tried any of the herban cowboys scented deodorants . 
plus ,  everything looks as generic  futuristic and edgy  as possible . 
many people will have less trouble with them . 
i enjoy annie chun products ,  but this is definitely a miss . 
as others have alluded to ,  it does get damp from sweat . 
does not fit on my remi tactical defense . 
that s it !  no aiming at all !  just pushing a button . 
unfortunately this saucepan does not fit into that category . 
i also think that is a waste of money . 
it s a good way to have people avoid you all day . 
my local store was sold out of the weiman cream i usually buy . 
overall it was one of the dumbest things they could have done . 
didn t seem to calm down the kitties at all . 
the spirulina also gives more bm odor control than chlorella in my experience . 
i love not having a cord to fight with . 
but i hate the texture of the moon dough . 
with the comb attachment adding extra thickness and heft . 
the consistency was very thick and would not glide on the nail . 
i am disappointed and i think there is definitely something better out there . 
that is ,  assuming you would want to actually eat this thing . 
i have used other now products that i liked . 
the fabric and elastic is much thinner and cheaper now . 
i was suckered into buying it at $
worked for exactly two charges and then died on me . 
afterwards they take turns picking which ones they though were the funniest . 
it doesn t make much of a difference at all . 
buyer beware !  did come with a cool little camo zipper bag . 
i bought this with high hopes from all the positive amazon reviews . 
i opened the product and used it to make some protein bars . 
it might work for you but it does nothing for me . 
i am not sure of its hydration properties . 
the blade became very loose after just a few uses . 
the material is cut to fit the shape of an iphone num_extend screen . 
i have very good skin so it is the product not my skin . 
when i received this phone case ,  i was very excited . 
passed this by two others who have children with disabilities . 
it s better for people with thick hair i imagine . 
but that s not the same as a blinkie . 
upon first connect the images were a total washed out blur . 
i payed way to much for these gloves . 
i d recommend them for work ,  as well as ,  dress jeans . 
just not really worth eating ,  in my opinion . 
as wario you look for lost treasure beat bad guys so on . 
i hate i got ripped on this one !  . 
now i have sent two back to amazon . 
or just use a glass on its side on the rug . 
the picture is very deceptive ,  it looks large in the picture . 
further i was informed that only the motor is warrantied for num_num years . 
i bought this about a month or so ago . 
this happened on average about once a minute . 
do not for the love of god try this game . 
this is one of the greatest video games ever made . 
after trying them myself ,  i don t really blame them . 
we gave one to a pug and he was fine with it . 
we ve been doing this for ourselves and our pets . 
also ,  has msg in it which bothers my stomach . 
for that ,  i am giving only num_num stars . 
any dbz product is bound to get a lot of attention . 
i love the sims and i love playing them . 
i used it for less then num_num weeks and it just stop working . 
secondly the solo man on a simple mission ,  give me a break . 
this was so bad i threw it away . 
i kept it together with electricians tape until they all broke off . 
the development of conjunctivitis or uri was tracked between the two groups . 
it constantly moves as i go about my day . 
the size was perfect for my galaxy num_extend
i am sure that it may just be me . 
the clog part is the only good part . 
even if cheap ,  screen protectors usually apply better than this one . 
got this thinking it would be a good addition to the lineup . 
additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive . 
just a bunch of cheap plastic crap to make a can walk around . 
i love roc products but this one i thought it was useless . 
i find that it smells artificial as compared to other brands . 
ran the diagnostics said drive is failing andreturned it to fry s electronics . 
got this as a gift ,  and took it back rather quickly . 
it is the biggest waste of money i ever spent . 
these bandages now only hold for about num_num hours beforethey start coming off . 
totally time of use was only around num_num hours . 
i had seen it on nearly every natural hair site i checked out . 
i am returning this shoe again and will be trying a different brand . 
i ve already gone through a motorola headset that died after two weeks . 
so it s like i bought two cleaners even though this says polish . 
i am returning this for a different headset . 
unfortunately both screen protectors i purchased seemed to form  lumps  after drying . 
this is more like green tea ,  no hint of jasmine . 
i think i just got lucky with it . 
cleaning the unit and taking chicken out of the unit isn t easy . 
bought it new ,  used it maybe five times and it failed . 
everyone keeps reviewing num_extend in general ,  and it s completely irrelevant . 
and i am usually very careful with stuff like this but . 
very good graphics card and num_num gb ram . 
while it hasn t happened to me  yet  ,  it certainly seems num_extend
the only thing we can understand is  feed me !  !  !   . 
i m truly mystified by the many good reviews this product has received . 
camera still works ,  but it sucks having to buy a new mount . 
the screen protectors applied to my phone very well . 
it slides around ,  so the finger slips off the trigger . 
hopefully if you order ,  you get all pieces . 
i feel that my phone is going to shatter if i drop it . 
it may have had stevia before but i could tolerate it . 
and this stuff is much like the original . 
they seemed much more shiny than what the picture portrays on my monitor . 
the signal continually goes in and out every two to three minutes . 
so then i ve had to hold it down to toast anything . 
i d say save your money and try something else . 
they are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget . 
the bars sound really good and i love strawberry . 
i bought these a few months ago at best buy for $ bucks . 
i m sure lucasarts will try again soon ,  hopefully . 
you have to have super dry tinder for this thing to work correctly . 
no reason for mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure . 
there could have definitely been a better design for this item . 
num_num months and this baby is ready for the trash . 
also ,  the quality of bristles is quite poor . 
i called again and spoke to someone else . 
the mice are probably getting a good laugh out of this contraption . 
then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left . 
you just need to get the bags that are shaped similarly . 
if they were comfortable ,  i would have ordered a replacement . 
the lower buttons work right as a normal click and right click . 
it always seems sold out ,  so i got this one . 
they are high fiber and all three girls love them . 
those of you who are clean freaks like me ,  beware . 
and ,  for the price ,  i am very disappointed . 
the pump only holds a small amount of pressure . 
no big deal given the price i guess . 
i should have stopped using it right there . 
the most important one being it s not safe . 
after i put this cable in ,  i now have num_num digital channels . 
unfortunately ,  after installing it on my num_extend i found out differently . 
i will not buy until they change it !  . 
the only thing i liked about this conditioner was the price . 
i bought a braun at tuesday morning for an incredible price . 
i used this on my long ,  straight ,  dry hair . 
c under counter maker would be nice if it had a thermal carafe . 
it was a waste of money for me . 
meaning you have to help it along at every position . 
the divider only serves to make the area smaller . 
after wearing for a few mintues ,  i got blister and swelling ears . 
each press makes a new tone come out . 
and ,  if you don t use the unit overnight  i . e . 
she completely ignores this toy even when filled with treats . 
avoid this product like the plague .  .  . total waste of money . 
i have very long hair ,  down til right about my butt lol . 
it does not lock into place or seal it at all . 
when the seam fails the bed has a huge bulge in the middle . 
since i can use nothing they sell they basically said thats just tough . 
i bought this because it looked sturdy and the oxo name . 
i like the idea of the toothbrush being so small . 
it does not say belkin anywhere on the tool . 
at least i have about ten songs in the num_extend player . 
both are counterfeit knockoffs of the true oem htc charger . 
i am definitely disappointed and would not buy this product . ps . 
this product did not do anything for my hair . 
i was successful only in wasting my time and elevating my blood pressure . 
i have found that too faced chocolate soleil matte bronzer is much better . 
didn t seem to make any difference at all . 
this soap makes me itch and break out in a rash . 
i saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth . 
if you have large hands ,  it will be very uncomfortable . 
in fact it made it flat and oily . 
then you are left with a dead case and phone . 
at $ it was an expensive lesson learned . 
the waist size was big for me so i returned it . 
i ve had guatemalan beans before ,  and i loved them . 
i have ibs  c  and suffer from constant gas and bloating . 
i used it for a few months and was pretty happy with it . 
as i said ,  this might work very well for cats . 
i ve since purchased others from belkin made in the u . s . 
i use it to store off season clothes mainly . 
the much cheaper ampro worked way better than bed head . 
she loves her baby dolls and was so sad with this product !  . 
the sellers must buy them from the same supplier . 
another plastic clip broke the second time i opened it !  . 
the original unreal was an interesting game for a few reasons . 
to the point where you don t even want to play . 
this is not the case with other ,  better bike num_extend
the leds died on this item but it still charges . 
bronner s ,  a bit of retinol and baby lotion . 
the player never learns why he hates love . 
these darned things have what is described as a milk flavor coating . 
i used it to write on white chocolate and it looks like crayon . 
even though my hair was clearly drenched ,  it felt stripped to me . 
when it arrived ,  it was so heavy and bulky . 
my dog does not necessary like this brush however . 
i advise everybody not to buy this game . 
the taste of sodastream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands . 
i started playing this game and it made me regret buying it . 
without a doubt the worst smelling aftershave ive ever gotten a whiff of . 
it s cheap ,  but it really isn t worth it . 
based on research ,  it sounds like probiotics are hit or miss . 
now mind you ,  all three of theses cats love to eat . 
the extra padding around the lower eye area is a nice touch . 
this is a standard  made in china  earbud . 
so keep that in mind with my review . 
this might resolve the biggest issue i have with this contraption . 
i ve to say that i m horribly disappointed about this shaver . 
i bought this because the reviews were so good . 
only solution is to send the console to microsoft for repairs . 
i had to return it for a refund . 
christopher s pills and pitched the kroeger wormwood herbs in the trash . 
i tried toasting it and grinding it and eating it over food . 
i can see why they had to add those in . 
everywhere i turn i only see this one and i hate it . 
he just passes it by for other toys . 
no spraying since then and my cat seems very very content . 
 ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  i will never buy this item ever again . 
as i write this review the expansion has been live for num_num hours . 
show  ,  complaining about everything ,  but i can t complain about this . 
i d rather know the variability than have that hidden from me . 
i swallowed about three gulps and poured out the rest into the sink . 
it s easier to trim them to fit before you peel them . 
i dropped my phone and it fell right out of this case . 
it made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face . 
the result is that this doesn t really taste like watermelon or strawberry . 
 heavy duty ?   more like a heavy duty waste of $
i didn t care that this color was the most expensive . 
while the smell is all right ,  the color seems unnecessary to me . 
the rubbery material the case is made out of has started to deteriorate . 
i know battery life on smartphones in general is not that great . 
completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller . 
it took three tries with this model to get it to stick . 
not well made ,  not interactive and just plain cheap !  . 
they just bounced off and ricocheted towards my neighbors house . 
so now you won t be confused or fooled . 
quite frankly this vacuum did not hold up well . 
i ended up having to glue everything to get it to stand . 
it s made well ,  but doesn t fit my body . 
i received one box from the vine program . 
so dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device . 
this tastes like carbonated orange juice ,  very tart . 
this should fit based on the measurements provided in the sizing guide . 
the am and sw sections are practically useless . 
this doesn t seem anything like a dog toy at all . 
the condition persisted ,  so i concluded this was a defected product . 
this game is the pits !  its the worst mario game ever . 
once i complained ,  it arrived a week later . 
i have yet to find any place that does . 
i bought these to treat small intestine bacterial overgrowth  sibo  . 
the game freezes for that brief moment ,  but the action does not . 
description says no msg added but ingredients list it . 
i bought these for a different purpose than shooting . 
we threw it out and ordered a cuisinart hand mixer as a replacement . 
the other keys are various sounds such as drums and crashes . 
junk ,  cheap speakers ,  after this we went back to crutchfield . 
i purchased my first num_num in complete faith of the cuisinart brand . 
this entire quest is overkill and i despise it . 
i may play with the dosage to see if that will work . 
these leggings are very short and very !  loose around the waist . 
every num_num to num_num minutes the switch simply disconnects everything attached to it . 
i was plesantly surprised at the sound quality of these headphones . 
that what i get for buying a cheap knockoff product from hong kong . 
i like toys like this but this particular model is defective . 
just don t inhale large amounts of it every day for years . 
gateway should immediately recall this product from the market . 
now i have never returned anything ,  so i felt bad . 
i bought this in may of num_num and it s now september num_extend num_extend
give me the old underwriter manual typewriter anytime . 
i like the freedom that it gives me . 
my hair felt totally damaged at this point . 
it s a decent concept but just didn t work out for us . 
tried a third time and it cracked .  .  .  without working  . 
so i simply cannot recommend this machine for bread making . 
the same is true with the wool ankle part . 
the led lights are also very hard to see under daylight conditions . 
it fit perfectly ,  if not for that feature . 
i put it on anyway and it did absolutely nothing for my skin . 
one minute your in the middle of the event and the next your num_extend
i would never have purchased them had i seen them at a store . 
i mean ,  if you like the small ones ,  they re great . 
the mediocre terminator :  dawn of fate was better than this dud . 
first off ,  i should mention that the stands are far from universal . 
this was only after two days of use in nyc . 
controls for jack and especially for kong are awful . 
mechanism causes water to splatter more as it pours ,  messy . 
i ve owned this watch for about three years now . 
it would work for a few hours with new batteries however . 
i was wary of this product before i bought it . 
screwed up my salt levels in the tank by trusting this . 
you sent the naturals shampoo come on amazon ,  get with it . 
may be hats shouldn t be bought on line . 
i think you could do better for the price . 
this feature can be accessed in the system tray as well . 
it is more comfortable than the metal one i also bought . 
but lesson learned ,  look elsewhere and just avoid this one . 
there is no documented fda proof this works . 
spent num_num days with the kids putting these together and painting them . 
so based on good reviews we tested this microwave . 
so it s still a good and proven system to get . 
i ordered this modem to add fax capabilities on my num_num computer . 
and i was unable to secure that plate . 
the thermometer was in celsius and therefore does me no good . 
you can get this for under $ at target . 
all our athletic gear was produced by champion . 
so as soon as they came i sent them back . 
does not keep the charge for the num_num hours as promised . 
i don t know what this term means in respect to this set . 
it is powered by num_num aaa batteries  included  . 
if i move my head at all ,  there is noise . 
all i did was follow the tmobile online activation . 
i ve had my cannon num_extend for over num_num years . 
birds will not use it except to roost on it . 
it smells terrible  we call it nustink  ,  but it works . 
i have a hard time believing something so simple could work so poorly . 
i think it s partially because of the heavy weight of it also . 
i wear a num_extend so i there s no heavy lifting . 
i added chicken and broccoli so it was tolerable ,  but not tasty . 
but after the second use it wouldn t charge anymore . 
trying to follow a play was also impossible . 
let me list the reasons that this game num_extend
with these scrubbers it kicks back and rips unevenly  . 
we just don t find it fun to constantly repair instead of play . 
neither kept my destructive son from wrecking his phone again though . 
maybe i got a defective unit ,  but i don t think so . 
it looked like a worm roamed around under the case every night . 
it basically does what its supposed to do . 
nwn diamond has num_extend stars from its customers . 
i own three other styles of crocs which are true to size . 
the replacement did the same thing after num_num months .   i liked the num_extend
i will never even look at or consider a fobus product ever again . 
barbie ,  pitching alcohol to a num_num year old . 
he s a small dog a corgie mixed with fox terrier . 
overallit was just lousy from the satellites to the woofer . 
at least you can choose from num_num different boards or themes . 
further ,  it s uncomfortable to wear and feels heavy behind my ear . 
the one i had was difficult to operate . 
i found broken seating clips along the edges . 
going by the measurements given i ordered the size i should have been . 
unfortunately ,  my experience was not a pleasant one . 
it didn t really feel like it was protecting my phone at all . 
made perfect sense ,  right ? the new one is terrible . 
  which is where you are most of the time anyways . 
i have had every generation of this remington . 
in the past i have always been satisfied with homedics products . 
luckily i had an acne medication i put on to counteract that . 
when it worked ,  i would rate it a num_extend broken a num_extend
i am amazed at the glowing reviews this product is getting . 
smells like children s tylenol ,  and is very greasy . 
i put it in my phone and it lasted maybe num_num minutes . 
afterwards ,  the croft and barrow shirts are ready to wear as is . 
i put this out this spring when the wasps began visiting our garden . 
my cats did eat this food ,  in fact they really enjoyed it . 
i kept hoping the main character would just die . 
it was too much of a hassle to clean in all those spaces . 
never the less ,  my dogs had ramen for lunch . 
this is the worst product i have ever purchased . 
num_num hours of the day ,  the litter box simply will not operate . 
also ,  the lightweight nature of its design somewhat negates this fact . 
will go back to the other styles i have bought . 
the num_extend one we mad was ruined because the bottom fell out . 
nobody would ever block like that !  the hitsticks look ridiculous . 
i bought this with high hopes and was let down . 
i ve never had any other croc do this . 
she took my name ,  email ,  telephone ,  address ,  etc . 
they may be  made in the usa  but that apparently means nothing . 
it still burns a lot and the drain is terrible . 
i had high expections of this mice but they never materialized . 
i do not have hours and hours to spend on this . 
they did call and offer to uprgrade for $ plus the hd num_extend
i got this one because it looks like a playstation replica . 
one or two revolutions and it grinds to a halt . 
it was returned within an hour of purchase . 
he actually started limping when i put them on ,  despite them fitting . 
i like the quality of the vortex fans ,  worth the extra . 
you will be spending a long time doing this . 
especially the constant robbing of home runs just ruins it . 
the size of the bags is great but it s not very strong . 
other than that ,  i did not get what i ordered . 
he takes about num_num of the same thing . 
and then paid to have this miracle product shipped from japan ?  wow . 
it does not compare to native forest coconut milk . 
this is marketed as a whole grain gluten free cereal . 
epic story that carried through during the entire game . 
i tried oily beans and i tried dry ,  lightly roasted beans . 
this is not a very good bird feeder . 
the microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth . 
this takes terrible photos  !  !  like worst ever can barely see it . 
and there was no eta for the local number to be fixed . 
i ordered two bottles of wen and i am now happy using wen . 
the waffles were almost burned in some places and barely brown in others . 
this is a great product while it works . 
i bought this only because i had a num_extend coupon for a bottle . 
one of my more unfortunate purchases ,  of late . 
i like other zensah products but this one did not work at all . 
it also did not minimize my pores the way it said it would . 
it does remove makeup well but the liquid remover is just easier . 
while i appreciate the workmanship ,  it does not work . 
hope you find something quieter that works well . 
this may have an acceptable texture ,  but the taste is terrible . 
i would never purchase a rena air pump again . 
i took one look at these and returned them . 
i dont know how i got through last parts with those yellow things . 
at less than $ dollars ,  it is a great buy . 
i m going to try another brand next time . 
so off with its head using a screwdriver get my cd back . 
my daughter is not overly hard on her toys . 
i was looking forward to trying this beverage mix . 
 i like the book much better than the  kit  . 
i purchased a stand identical for less than a dollar . 
after a few rounds we decided to move on to something else . 
this cordless handheld vacuum is just plain lousy . 
this pencil has a very warm color that looks pretty bad . 
not at all the titian  coppery red  color indicated !  ! beware . 
i give it num_extend stars . cons : works best for small tortillas . 
the track ball is slippery and to light . 
then feel the rounded tips on a herm sprenger collar . 
it s unfair for me to rate something i have yet to use . 
all i can say is that i am a thin guy . 
when i saw this was for num_num people i thought it would do . 
this took quite some time to figure out . 
she had the stuffing out within num_num minutes . 
all it means is that you paid more . 
cheaply made ,  low quality fleece ,  and not worth the money . 
i used around num_num times ,  and the attachment fell apart ,  totally . 
even free crap at the fair comes with shoddy instructions . 
i purchased this because my grandson loved the other one we had . 
not really ,  but then ,  not too bad either . 
i guess now i get the chance to buy what i actually want . 
these wireless speakers further deteroriate the music and make is sound dull . 
i bought this a few years ago and thought it was absolute garbage . 
also its microphone not working clearly !  this product is really disappointing . 
i did not see any difference even after applying for long time . 
also ,  make sure there aren t other active ingredients . 
also the markings on the pots peel off pretty quick . 
i couldn t even begin to get them on . 
and i am looking for another one right now . 
price is okay and it got here in good time . 
i bought these in ivory ,  for a wedding . 
i have owned many a laptop and several notebook cooling pads . 
this could have disastrous effects in the long num_extend cheap clips . 
they are okay ,  but kinda boring after a while . 
i was not able to set it correcty even with the instructions . 
but truly ,  the taste is something just south of mediocre . 
it can be convenient in certain times to have it around though . 
the gutr was uncomfortable ,  interfered with the helmet and did not work . 
all the people running around are the same thing over and over . 
there is this one stubborn air bubble that would not work out . 
the useful life on this grinder was very short as expected . 
i have gone over every inch of that room to no avail . 
the outer material is very thin and everything is light gauge . 
this product gave me horrible ,  cystic ,  swollen painful deep acne breakouts . 
for one thing ,  it doesn t go very fast . 
they didn t last more than a few months . 
my hair was not manageable or tangle free . 
the color pictured is a soft pink ,  almost a nude color . 
all and all i am looking for a better gauge . 
it is missing the usual orange color of chedar . 
it s pretty scary hearing it boil four inches from your face . 
i think an actual mhl plug is mandatory . 
it is what he does best ,  and enjoys most ,  in life . 
 ,  it has what i call a filler taste . 
so i ordered another brand and it works wonderfully !  . 
the glass seemed nice could see clearly out to num_num yds . 
fortunately ,  this will be my last panasonic product . 
too bad because i need a solution to charge on the go . 
amazon will probably take it back but then back to the drawing boards . 
it s still available for purchase and tastes much better than this version . 
ill give it a star for the graphics but that is it . 
you have a cool selection of weapons and cars to choose from . 
dont expect any keeper shots if you need fast recycling time between shots . 
i was looking for a mostly savory with very light sweet undertones . 
my cat loves this ,  then i noticed it has  carrageenan  in it . 
it looks metal ,  but feels like it s plastic . 
i got this at a mall stand for about $
i decided to try a different flavor . it was a big mistake . 
tried this on my brand new shimano crank and it didn t fit . 
very flimsy ,  won t work because of the flimsyness of the product . 
for me it was a total waste of money . 
it pairs ,  connects ,  then disconnects on it s own . 
i felt the angles were wrong on the scoop . 
the plastic used in a gallon milk jug is stronger . 
my dog had this apart literally within an hour . 
it will not look like the picture shown . 
ridiculous !  also ,  this is the roughest lambswool that i ve seen . 
this product s speaker just fell apart on its own . 
good only for leafy vegetables and soft fruits . 
the packaging material was also not appropriate for something this delicate . 
i bought this for my parents for their chow chow puppy named rocky . 
none on the box and none in the directions . 
i tried rinsing with vinegar ,  soaking in soapy water ,  etc . 
cantu shea butter is what i am using now . 
i ll just go back to my regular coffee grinder . 
the range on the remote is only about four feet . 
will i purchase again ,  i m debating due to the leakage . 
it comes in a very nice basket with a silky fabric ribbon . 
let this review stand to warn potential buyers from doing business with them . 
the color is fading and chipped in certain areas . 
it was impossible to get chipped ice from this blender . 
blade was very sharp out of the box . 
i returned this lens and got the sigma num_extend
i contacted the seller and they contacted thule on my behalf . 
bah !  i had to buy a completely new pair of keens . 
yes ,  it gives you a decent number of games on one disc . 
the quality of these tablets seemed very poor . 
nice idea ,  but no treat for my num_num kitties anyway . 
my screen and the back of my phone have numerous pits and crinkles . 
i saw no results whatsoever with this product . 
very average ,  and you wouldn t expect much from it . 
i bought this handheld after seeing its impressive screen . 
i could not get a solid seal on the back strap . 
i own this set and it was a complete waste of money . 
it looked more like floor sweepings than cut tea . 
pay the extra $ and get the amzer case . 
it was a pleasant enough odor but that was the end of it . 
the graphics require a very high graphics card and memory . 
well ,  i want to clear this up once and for all . 
i thought it was because i needed to try different headsets . 
i tried them and they lived down to their rep . 
these things slip right off of my head . 
seriously .  .  . this should have been highlighted in the product description . 
my hair felt dry ,  looked dry ,  frizzy and worse . 
i previously rated this player as num_num star . 
after months of shedding my hair is now limp and lifeless permanently . 
i wanted to take this as a magnesium supplement . 
they vomited food first ,  then bright red blood . 
also ,  there is very little room for  hands on  play . 
i also feel that it is hard to manipulate . 
i probably just got a bad one this time . 
i bought this to smell nice after i shave . 
track plus a low thomas train does not fit under the bridge . 
everything seemed flawless ,  until i started playing my music back . 
it failed to charge after the initial charge . 
i have been buying american apparel yoga pants for years . 
if you do ,  it s just a waste of your money . 
you still need some place to spit it out . 
entertaining for my wife ,  yes ,  but this thing is no good . 
as bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be ,  that is . 
it has lots of uses to prevent boredom . 
the package came and we were all excited . 
also ,  pacbell park doesn t look like the real one . 
can t complaint since hair types differ and not everything works for everyone . 
they are frustrating and not worth the bother . 
this ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game . 
i will revise this review if it comes up . 
not as wonderful as the old pair ,  but okay . 
it can only connect to the barnes and noble online num_extend
i took a few macro photos and these photos turned out pretty good . 
want to attack ?  you can only attack the left and right . 
now the maker stops prematurely ,  leaving the coffee weak . 
there is a ton to unlock like secret characters and an endless dungeon . 
i like putting on face lotion before i put my makeup on . 
no where to go ,  no where to hide . 
so depends on how much protection you are looking for . 
if you like a styling gel ,  this might work for you . 
box says to use half concentrate to half milk . 
i purchased this to mount on a mountian bike for road riding only . 
with teamspeak and your clan members you will own all . 
might have worked if it wasn t too sensitive to outside noise . 
it s so excruciating that i can t go to sleep . 
and on adept and higher setting th game becomes more furious . 
i found those to be better amazon products . 
this does not happen with my ricoh num_extend or my oly num_extend
he certainly knew this from the other calculators in the house . 
it was just no fun for me . gameplay was disappointing . 
i would suggest you go with nyko s airflo gamepad instead . 
but it s a crime not to size it . 
i gave up trying to use them with the children . 
i ve had two sets of these headphones over the years . 
there is no reason this should have happened . 
you really have to thump it around to get litter clumps moving . 
at present blizzard has no plans to fix this feature . 
you can see where the handle was snapped off . 
that allows them to steal items from in front of you . 
i suggest amazon to retire this product inmediately of selling . 
the product was not built up in the sprayer . 
i guess it is because of the length of the adapter . 
the length includes both ends of the clasps . 
perhaps they would work for a tiny dog . 
i got it pretty late ,  and it doesn t even work . 
now i know why verizon cancelled selling of this phone soon after release . 
maybe i just wasn t doing the exercises the way i should . 
the dragon is the best looking of the bunch . 
if you put a pistol in ,  it would slide all around . 
i purchased this because many reviewers talked about how durable it was . 
filter worked fine for num_extend months and then died . 
feels like glycerine and water are the main component of the lotion . 
i should have listened the other reviewers who are real people like me . 
have to reorder with a different style so the cuff is higher . 
i can tell you what it didnt do . 
att immediately shutoff the access to view my att account on their website . 
i ruined several dishes trying to get this right . 
even with transitioning our dog over slowly ,  it still gave her diarrhea . 
very nice bra ,  but did not work for the girls . 
this game isn t that great and gets boring fast . 
don t waste your money on these pieces of junk . 
stop dosing your tank with dead bacteria and other  miracle  products . 
it is a nice big bottle and it does look pretty cool . 
it is also loose in the cigarette lighter socket ,  keeps turning off . 
as soon as i dropped it ,  it broke into pieces . 
majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as active num_extend
now granted ,  perhaps this product has some kind of short . 
i emailed customer service last week but have not heard from them . 
i would not recommend this product to friends or relatives . 
i have a pebble on my wrist right now . 
this spray does not seem to do anything . 
i to essie no chips ahead ,  which has worked great . 
so now i have a white and tan tub with rust spots . 
i bought it for my magnavox dvd recorder that skips on playback . 
this heater never got the blind warm in the least . 
so yes ,  you have to go there everytime you want to save . 
unless your a num_num year old fan of total recall . 
one called five times a day for many days . 
all things considered it is not a bad $ deal but . 
and god forbid you use a white wash cloth to apply the soap . 
i returned the game ,  and amazon was very fair regarding a refund . 
the fabric is cheap and the collar doesn t lay flat . 
this game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization num_extend
it s better spent on something like painkiller or num_extend
from now on i will be buying my almonds from trader joe s . 
the main problem is with how cheaply it s made . 
that s what smokehouse has done by adding  usa  to their name . 
the smaller the particle size ,  the more toxic it is  see table num_extend
but if you can work around that it works . 
even my good gel couldn t fight the power of this conditioner . 
other reviews really surprise me considering how many dogs i have . 
i could not do so and had a friend help me . 
it would get old  as in tiring  very fast . 
troubleshooting was useless . thankfully amazon handled the return quickly . 
however ,  i was not impressed with the restorative treatment . 
then when i gave up ,  my husband worked on it . 
at least when barbie goes camping she does it practically . 
the use is more for halloween or something to dress up with . 
so don t expect to use your computer while it s charging . 
with the second num_extend the warranty had just expired when it finally failed . 
cheap ,  barely fits the phone ,  hard to get on and off . 
for me ,  it only seemed to sit on my skin . 
most of the time ,  they don t really work at all . 
however ,  my cats did not like the grass in their water bowl . 
sometimes spidey ll be stuck on walls or pillars . 
i think foot soaking works better than any devices one can buy . 
you become a hero fighting villains and interacting with a huge community online . 
the lotion is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin . 
tis is what i would consider as a scam . 
this tastes like someone threw grass and baking cocoa in a blender . 
if i could give it num_num stars i would . 
i honestly don t feel any difference at all . 
try a pack from your local health food store first . 
i purchased the west bend num_num cordless water kettle num_num months ago . 
it is a little too much on the watery side . 
reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken . 
had a difficult time pairing this item with my phone . 
ever since sor num_num came out in num_num i wanted it . 
my dog tore the cover off the ball . 
there is so much extra that it almost wraps around my leg twice . 
before long ,  though ,  it began to get annoying . 
fable s greatest criticism was how short it was ,  and simple . 
these curve so badly that they are nearly impossible to use . 
the strategic aspect of the game is great . 
any other mmorpg has at least num_num times the content ddo does . 
it adds colour to cake but you cannot establish what character they are . 
the zipper is narrow and on the back of the van . 
i do not believe it would be any rougher and unpleasant feeling . 
had num_num of these ,  both were free or just about free . 
i have changed my rating from four stars to only two stars . 
it is so hard for deep fry in this pot . 
however ,  there is no repair service available after the warranty period . 
strike two . the last time  as they say  was the charm . 
my skin is sensitive and i don t know what to use . 
its bright enough to use when your power goes out . 
so don t waste either your money of counter space on it . 
the same problem  though not as severe  happened with final fantasy anthology . 
this product is advertised to setup and hold underwater . 
a big waste of money on such good looking shoes ,  pitty . 
was able to make a nice single serve entree . 
careful and check your video card before buying this game . 
trouble especially since i am disabled and in wheelchair . 
i can just turn my back and lose the signal sometimes . 
we often play a game called indian signs which is similar . 
i have two other mui knife holders and they are great . 
i cannot recommend this product based on my experience . 
i purchased the quart and gallon bags instead which works great . 
the items are floating ,  spinning defiances of physics and common num_extend
would have returned if the box didn t get thrown away . 
ended up using this more like a shaving lotion . 
i  stuck  with it for about num_num years . 
one for me ,  one for my son one for my daughter . 
just more painful than it needs to be . 
other than the strap i did not liked the way it fit me . 
i ve had mine just one year this month . 
what a disappointment ,  i guess i ll be going to a tivo . 
so disgusted just threw the thing away and not bothering to return it . 
i love the concept behind melissa and doug toys . 
fell off right on schedule with her growing nails . 
however ,  if you are expecting audiophile quality ,  you will be disappointed . 
they promptly replaced the entire unit at their expense . 
i reviewed another type of hanes socks num_extend those were much better . 
you get to create your hero from scratch . 
i thought i was getting a bargain by buying the pd num_num for $
i ve had mongol horse lancers defeat two units of machine gun infantry . 
i lost a lot of money with this quirky little chaotic doohickey . 
the game goes from insanely difficult and times to just plain easy . 
already by this point i had decided to return it . 
the overall construction of the device is cheaply made . 
i would not recommend it for presta valves . 
it looks good when you put on and does brighten eye area . 
i ve tried to contact honeywell customer service ,  with no response . 
my skin became very very flaky and irritated . 
it didn t even come close to staying on . 
the second thing is the very irritating music . 
in the meantime ,  i can t use it anymore . 
and second because he likes to watch his father mow the lawn . 
well my num_num yr old black and decker toaster died . 
they look like they could be just about any street anywhere . 
my cat is num_extend and might not be heavy enough . 
he has always had itchy skin and scratched a lot . 
i bought it as part of a gag gift survival kit . 
the only good bras jockey makes are sports bras . 
but the game ?  this is the worst game i have ever played . 
i had zero problems installing and using these tubes . 
it s a shame to be inconvenienced like this . 
you d be better off spending your money elsewhere . 
like another reviewer i purchased these for my omron pedometer . 
this product was provided for me by my company . 
i saw this on amazon and thought i d give it a try . 
this had an aftertaste that was like eating the worst chemicals . 
but right out of the box it didnt work . 
the free  dataswitch  app toggles num_extend on and off . 
but afterwards there were no smell on my hair afterwards . 
the design just didn t fit my expansive monetary needs . 
i guess you get what you paid for . 
this was a nice umbrella when it worked . 
some of the plastic edges must have been sharp . 
i ve been wearing dockers for a lot of years . 
i have the original austin and i love that pair of shoes . 
if i wanted great visuals ,  i d go see the film . 
thought i was trying a new thing based on the walkers brand . 
was so tight i couldnt even sit down . 
the headphones lasted through about eight airplanes flights and then stopped working . 
hamilton beach sent me a brand new broken replacement . 
this fact is not mentioned anywhere . a big disappointment . 
graphics are improved but still very much similar to halo num_extend
the screen focuses on her bust area and her bottom area . 
there is no excess to charge your phone with this on . 
group than i originally had after reading his book . 
sure this game might play well on other platforms but for the psp . 
the near misses get to be very boring after a while . 
i don t know why it came off completely without warning . 
unfortunately ,  i did not like these very much . 
it s probably smarter than me ,  maybe that s the problem . 
these speakers cause a performance issue in my pc . 
all showing a trace with the last three not listed as organic . 
i recieved purple water definatly not any syrup . 
wish i had bought the neck piece separately . 
i ve tried num_num different flavors of the switch brand beverages . 
the graphics are just outstanding ,  and far better than num_extend
fair enough . this light also does not fall into the second category . 
i emailed them that very same day and waited a week without response . 
fortunately notmad  red chair software ,  recommended by another reviewer  is fully functional . 
if you are a size num_extend go ahead and buy the num_extend
the daily moisturizer ,  however ,  cause redness ,  stinging and irritation . 
i dont enjoy having the ends of my fingers pinched . 
i had to turn it in circles to get anything . 
actually ,  that s about the time the fun ends . 
within days of the delivery ,  i suffered severe cardiac failure . 
unfortunately it weighs one pound more than stated in the product description . 
get the defender case which has hard plastic and rubber . 
this is a good case for my galaxy num_extend
 extra fabric in a d .   it felt too big too exercize in . 
so this was on saturday i put it out . 
this is the worst dental water additive i bought for my dogs . 
also i find the flavor far inferior to the real thing . 
my linksys wireless works great all the time . 
as an adult i find this game extremely boring . 
this works very well under extremely limited conditions . 
i could do the mental calculations to change the time zone . 
i purchased two different playtex bras with my order . 
these really didn t fit in the box well . 
i swear i could count the pores in everyone s skin . 
it looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the xbox controller . 
may be it will work for somebody with short hair . 
ear phones would still function ,  but speaker would not . 
stopped taking it immediately and am now spending the weekend in recovery . 
i had to stop using it ,  sad to say . 
i do however question whether the word  pro  should apply to this system . 
it does pench your ears ,  but it s not too bad . 
when cuisinart tells you to rinse and dry each component they mean it . 
this product is totally far from what it is advertised to be . 
i can wash and dry without doing anything else . 
the silver buckle and thong between your toes is awful . 
did not really help with eliminating odor from kitchen . 
to compare that the original xbox has a num_num mhz processor . 
they re not terrible but they also aren t that great . 
i just finished a second thirty minute ride today and it was brutal . 
the electronic adjustments where a bit confusing for my girlfriend . 
i could barely wear them cut in half for a flare look . 
i ordered it direct from seidio along with a case . 
the biggest complaint i have are the controls and the physics . 
didn t read it until after i made this purchase . 
my son has played with it for about an hour since christmas . 
maybe im doing it wrong ,  but this is white and clumpy . 
one of the songs also says thank you once . 
this broke only after a few days of having it . 
i bought num_num packs and had to throw them all away . 
in either case it didn t help at all . 
i couldn t get the inner part out to change the filter . 
i will not be using this any longer . 
and for some reason i can t get frontline to work anymore . 
i just printed the return shipping label and am sending this back asap . 
judge by the wwii generation who are among the healthiest people . 
that s a pretty big error for oven cooking . 
technically a well made game ,  but the concept is just not there . 
we make tea by the gallon and then put them in the frig . 
you get four controller ports ,  like on the nintendo gamecube . 
the papers were thin ,  really thin and flimsy . 
since they weren t on the cooking surface i chose to ignore them . 
only to find out that % of my earrings didnt go in this . 
the installation took some work ,  but worked out in the end . 
perhaps the faceted crystals would be more what i was looking for . 
it s just an overpriced chew toy in a weird shape . 
and this is exactly what madden will be like ,  with different rosters . 
it s just an expensive hunk of nikon plastic .   .  .  .   . 
for the most part ,  this toy is okay . 
but decided to take the jump and get one . 
all you have to do is hold your position and wear them down . 
save your money . it is very weak in design . 
it is super thin and not what i expected . 
this product came without the num_num essential  speciality  screws to put it together . 
if you zip all your small files ,  not so bad  . 
this is my second pair of this shoe . 
for now ,  i am sticking with ptr unwrinkle eye . 
sega was now the enemy and they had to go . 
as a design they are beautiful but very uncomfortable ,  sorry . 
the vast majority of videos show cars crashing into walls left and right . 
the brown version feels much thinner and is not nearly as strong . 
that price is reasonable for the amount of stuff included . 
the flower box is attractive and pretty well built . 
i found this pizza peel to be a total waste of money . 
it actually dried me out instead of moistening my skin . 
didn t have too many issues with the litter sticking to the box . 
my six month old son does not show much interest in this toy . 
there s still lots of elbow grease involved cleaning this thing up . 
i frequently get messages on the ipad ten minutes before the iphone . 
i used this with the thoroughly clean face wash . 
here on amazon ,  this product has the following information provided . 
this is quite possibly the worst purchase i ve made on amazon . 
i think it may be to narrow to work properly . 
zoe may be good olive oil  ,  but check the codes often . 
a bit flimsy and the plastic tips are pathetic . 
the stick are good ,  but most are broken . 
ok ,  i can afford aa batteries ,  not a big deal . 
there is nothing in the box that would help you open it . 
and imagine they work in some areas and not in others . 
the legs are only about num_num inches long . 
again ,  this was only my fourth ride on this tire . 
for better item with bling not this one . 
i cannot recommend it for people who are overweight . 
i didn t realize how good i had it . 
it was exactly what i was looking for and the price was right . 
unfortunately it was a very short love afair . 
these are some of the narrowest shoes i ve seen . 
i was tested for lactose intolerance years ago although no milk allergy . 
i will be returning ,  and ordering the proper size !  . 
however ,  don t install it in the middle of the dash . 
at lease no one will try to steal it . 
that is only it s disadvantage; power inverter does not last !  . 
my oem battery last a lot longer than this crap . 
not at all the fit i was expecting . 
moreover ,  the cover is not zippered and removable ,  as described . 
but i guess thats what i get for buying cheap . 
my wire brush does a better job and pulls less . 
so i ended up just packing them away for the next baby . 
spend a little more money and get the real thing !  . 
we have used frozen fruit and ice and have had no issue . 
the fight got called in the first round . 
in other words ,  it didn t fix what wasn t broken . 
it looks like it s been worn for a year . 
the top part of the sock is very thin . 
i ve tried almost every weight gainer product out there . 
i purchased this to maintain my bikini line between waxes . 
you can fool me once with something like this . so . 
i think they will make a mario party num_extend
and that s saying something on this console system . 
it obviously is much more comfortable for her . 
i did not feel any of the relief effects that some people said . 
in my opinion ,  this is a poor choice . 
anyways ,  i have tried tons of products to relieve my worst symptoms . 
all this machine does is snap ,  even though it is clean . 
i think the proactiv products are very overpriced and undersized . 
such are concerns of food engineers simulating aspects of cream without using creme . 
it smells like bug repellant or some strange synthetic chemical i cannot place . 
however ,  the system itself leaves alot to be desired . 
and when hasbro brought beyblade over here it was great . 
this fan is loud and makes waaay too much noise . 
the nubs are not something any pet or person wants to walk on . 
this num_num pack will last me a long ,  long time . 
we replaced the battery and it still didn t work . 
the fit and finish of the num_extend case was well beyond the first . 
works if you have cold soda and it s frozen . 
cookie monster always cute but doesn t really say any phrases like supergrover . 
good product and cheaper than at beauty stores . 
this was unbearable and rode the rest of the way bare handed . 
not just seepage ,  but small jets of water from bad casting . 
i stopped couting at num_num of them being squished in . 
the liquid quality is not consistent .  .  . applicator is good . 
the biggest issue was the loop that goes over your ear . 
i purchased two nalgene bike bottles and have lost both for road riding . 
i cannot disagree with the reviewers who give this facial cleanser high stars . 
kit was easy to understand ,  and everything was as described . 
the smaller plates really allow me to do this . 
maybe he was trying to high jump over a bush . 
also have trouble fitting the attachments on but more so ,  off . 
it doesn t look nearly as good as the picture in person . 
so lame because it can be pretty funny . 
i dropped mine off the couch and it didn t work anymore . 
i put a wrestler at num_extend and he was as tall as angle . 
;  and wont melt down before seven years are up . 
but the presentation of this game is indeed beyond ridiculous . 
this blender replaced a sunbeam i had for num_num years . 
suffice it to say ,  i do not answer the door anymore . 
this one i guess is the cheaper version of derma e products . 
i had to drain and clean it everyday . 
i far prefer the storm or brunswick ones . 
this game took num_num seconds to get on my nerves . 
they are the same model number and look identical . 
i made sure the speaker switch was in the correct position . 
i can t urge enough to not purchase this nylabone product . 
do not be suckered in by the advertised  unlimited data  $ plan . 
last summer ,  i reviewed thesportcraft ladderballwith my sons . 
only the back half will stay attached to your bike . 
the num_num stacking cups are a nice addition . 
the medium harness was just too dangerous for my dog . 
also ,  the gps unit itself grabs the satellites right now  quickly  . 
so does the plastic housing around the bulbs . 
and amazon s idea of help is to tell you to call nydj . 
i like to keep my reviews short and simple . 
the display is small and difficult to read . 
bought two of these in april of num_num and now it november . 
so ,  finding something that adds height without the discomfort is hard . 
something has changed within the last year on how they make these . 
target has a bunch of similar carafes  for as low as $
there was debris and bubbles already on these . 
the dry feeling that is felt after is unbearable . 
but not worth the bother to return them . 
they are afraid of this product to get close to their eyes . 
instead they tried to be  hip  and ruined the whole game . 
not a good shampoo for coily natural hair folks . 
this creates an odd shaped slice of bread . 
and its hard to hear . i would stay away from this . 
plug and play !  better user interface and better looking  i think  . 
seems very cheaply made and therefore it was promptly returned . 
it does`nt make any scence watching the clips . 
normally use the whole organic tomatoes by glen muir . 
i bought one of these units because of its waterproof rating . 
the graphics are good and scenery is very realistic . 
i have worn the targhee for years now and love them . 
within just a week of owning this toy it started having problems . 
all of this removes so much player agency it s depressing . 
from now on i am staying away from hoover products . 
update :  i gave up on this and went to rapidlash . 
and there are many of the quarter inches . 
i ended up putting baby oil on the pads to remove my mascara . 
and it takes about num_num days to fade . 
both i and my husband will change brands ,  unless this is corrected . 
but in all actuality this may be a product that does work . 
it can be invisible to the naked eye . 
pachmayr has made great grips in the past but these are sub par . 
right when i put the case on the button popped off . 
i weighed them and they re about num_num lb num_extend
i could get one tab in but never both . 
this was definitely not the way to go . 
in fact i won t even use the rest of this box . 
she has some anxietys due to territorial issues with her sister tigger . 
out of the other brands on the market i bet this is tops . 
too bad oster used to be a name that meant quality . 
we have to fill the reservoir up just about every other day . 
i ve never seen a screen protector that does this . 
the scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile . 
so ,  its most useful function is taking portraits of yourself . 
when i prepared it ,  i ended up with a sticky mass . 
such a great product with so few ingredients ,  i wish she liked . 
i generally like philosophy products ,  but this stuff is not worth it . 
i drop my phone at times and i need the case there . 
i did not seem much improvement with this product . 
this thing is a battery monster ,  gobble gobble gobble . 
my puppy loves to chew ,  so i got these . 
battery simply ddin t hold a charge after following charging directions . 
the gloves were great except they were way too large for a child . 
however having said this the green light was on . 
the case doesn t fit snuggly on my phone . 
however ,  these thoughts were soon dashed after bringing the product home . 
it is hard to find your way around . 
after each visit ,  they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape . 
that makes the bowls almost twice the price . 
what arrived was a bag num_extend long and num_extend wide . 
this is num_num ingredients ,  ,  , and they are easily obtainable . 
they all showed negative ,  but the test line worked . 
there s better sonic games out there ,  look elsewhere . 
wish i had taken the other reviews to heart . 
i wouldnt buy it again ,  its expensive too . 
the brown one broke as i was sliding it into my hair . 
num_extend boring boring boring boring boring boring boring . 
guess i should thank my parents  genes for that one . 
after play it can not be stored in box unless arms are removed . 
i bought these toys after our old toys became full of mold . 
it doesn t taste good ,  but it s not really repugnant either . 
spinning would be ok if you re not doing too many jumps . 
well ,  it didn t work out for me on my lee press . 
there were more words in the name than pieces in the bag . 
the cup frame is very thin and flimsy . 
it arrived num_num days late and poorly packaged in an envelope . 
like say when its sitting on a shelf . 
windows num_num didn t have the right codec to view the file . 
i even offered to buy one from them and got no response . 
you ll need to decide if this is okay with you . 
don t waste your time or money on this junk . 
i got this as a gift about num_num months ago . 
it s num_num inches and can stretch to num_num inches . 
the company i purchased from is not customer service friendly . 
i emptied the next noodle packet into a colander and rinsed them vigorously . 
the result is a bit sweet ,  and a bit gritty . 
i would not recommend this brand to you . 
they promptly sent a replacement for the exact shears i originally bought . 
i do like the main body being made of tempered glass . 
but the thing is ,  it doesn t become lighter . 
i went to the website ,  youtube and followed the instructions . 
their bakeware is much more reasonably priced ,  than the arcusine . 
try out the suggestions and recipes and see what works for you . 
it may be applied under moisturizer or worn by itself . 
nonetheless ,  too much time and money on an expensive tool . 
be careful when using this product with neon tetras . 
developed a rip on the bottom after just one day of minimal use . 
it is different than the normal day moisturizer . 
but the other day i decided to give it another try . 
my hair looked shiny and pretty from the num_extend
the hairs on the brush fluff out instantly and start falling out . 
a high price to pay for keeping the light out . 
i bought this to try since my guys love the paw lickin chicken . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
we have a gluten free household of num_extend
the chin thing also was cutting into my chin and hurting too . 
it took me a few days to position it correctly under the pillow . 
it is not a game ,  it s a movie . 
its pretty much just a useless black donut . 
this is an ok attachment but it has its flaws . 
pay the extra money and get a good set . 
doctors will only check iron serum ,  unless you specifically request ferritin . 
this is a cheap coffee maker that used to be a good value . 
be aware of this product . it s not real samsung product . 
the mic is cheap and bulky !  the soundtracker feature is useless . 
that is why i rate the headphone down . 
it isn t available at the local health food store . 
this is a poor design for such a large knife . 
this might be ok if you can stomach the taste . 
i bought these because bobby pins don t stay put in my hair . 
there is a red top to remind you not to do that . 
so sad i believe other review and but it without smell it first . 
the vga cable is the only way to get the num_extend
i am a palm user ,  but was seduced by a $
result ?  the nylon gear is stripped and the knife is irreparably dead . 
i am really disappointed in this product and am considering returning it . 
it is one of the worst and stupidest games i have ever played . 
it came in a plastic bag with around num_num equally cheaply made bbs . 
i prefer the orange kind made by miller s more . 
the bottom of the soles are also very slick . 
yet another game i regret buying for the xbox system . 
it lasted only a few weeks before i regretted my purchase . 
alternatively ,  you can buy one of the currently offered versions . 
i will stick with the more simple cases . 
actual gameplay isn t too bad ,  but nothing special either . 
now i need replacements as both peeled off completely . 
if they tried to ride this one ,  they just fell off . 
i bought it because of the great reviews and hoped it would work . 
my first tiffen uv filter came with a lens i bought . 
run plain patches through until they come out clean . 
so stay away from other senna products ,  too . 
only reason i left one star is because the cable is still good . 
however there is a pretty glaring flaw with these cases . 
the  ladybug xylophone  is no longer included in this set . 
we charged them ,  connected to the phones and . 
this gave me a fever so i deemed it dangerous . 
it should not cost an arm and a leg . 
these shoes are too big ,  but in an odd way . 
either way it detracts from the fun to me . 
not a big deal . its smaller than i thought . 
for the price ,  it may be acceptable to some . 
i tried it with peeled and unpeeled garlic . 
 el rio   is still the num_num star champ . 
recommend wetting backs of either with water prior to putting on . 
the taste is rather nice but i can t recommend this at all . 
thought i was at least getting one more figure for that price . 
what i planned to use this for was for straightforward playback only . 
i really liked the shape and fit of this bra . 
then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off . 
also ,  the story sequences take way too long . 
seems to be falling apart with not much use . 
the minigames will get old and it just won t be fun . 
the machine is num_num months old and looks new . 
the packaging for the tablets is also good . 
but ,  this coffee didn t pass the taste test . 
we were given this quesadilla maker as a gift . 
made weird buzzing sound and i was afraid it would blow up . 
the visuals are great ,  but that s about it . 
so i only used the tray a few times . 
a pet cannot even be placed behind it for proper desk duty . 
well ,  it isn t worth even the price of shipping . 
i thought stainless steel did not rust so i returned the pitcher . 
sadly ,  i feel for these previews and reviews as well . 
i bought it here in amazon cause it was cheaper . 
but so completely typical and over the top . 
btw ,  gave it num_num star ,  cuz there s not a zero . 
maybe we can use it for the dog waste outside !  . 
i was so excited to get this item . 
i wish i did that or downloaded the demo . 
the product is great because we are lego fans . 
this is bad because there are wires and stuff to mess with . 
who knows how well any multivitamin works ?  i can t tell . 
those without it are not missing out on anything . 
look for brands like sprenger that makes them with rounded tips . 
i have not tried the headset with any other cell phones . 
after about num_num months it wouldn t even do that . 
it worked great for a month or so ,  then it just stopped . 
also the menu selection process is slow and non intuitive . 
it had no dramatic effect on my skin . 
sometimes ,  however ,  it locks up permanently ,  requiring a reboot . 
last night i had to make a roux in my good cookware . 
i figured six balls would be enough to go around . 
street fighter anniversary addition was a big disappointment . 
shortly after both of my dogs developed uncontrollable diarrhea . 
bigger than expected ,  not easy to change from shoe to shoe . 
might work for people that don t have sensitive skin . 
the bowl disconnects from the base so you can wash it . 
one for me and one for my girlfriend . 
the rubber case is a little cheap to . 
came very large so i had to cut it . 
this does not taste at all like brown sugar . 
if you don t use a tray it will get on your floor . 
i am having doubts about the brands quality . 
don t know why they are all right in smaller pans . 
i ve stopped useing this product and threw the remaining capsules away . 
it distinctly lacks in any sort of flavor . 
i hate getting taken by cops and i hate kiddish robot toys . 
then my slide would not rest in the proper position . 
i love the slim ,  minimal design of this mount . 
he is quiet and focused when lacing them . 
makes a weird high pitch squeel while it charges . 
this was due to resistance from the potato . 
i like the safety lock just below the sprayer s trigger . 
just stops and doesn t go through the hair to cut it . 
plastic comb attachments work better for this length . 
i m a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands . 
i can wash and dry without doing anything else . 
i ve dealt with massive headaches from drm from num_extend gold . 
i have had much better luck with the kong dodo . 
things immediately cleared up the moment i took him off this food . 
can t you believe it ?  i just through it away immediately . 
i ordered a size num_extend of this item  what i normaly use  . 
the formula clumped really badly and flaked as well . 
i would leave rock hard ice cream on the counter to soften . 
this thing is a waste of moeny and time . 
this is the second set of the num_extend i bought . 
they only get num_num star because it s the lowest rating . 
it was well made just wish it was taller . 
i m so disappointed to find this product containing methylparaben . 
i came to visit and tried myself ,  just dead . 
fell off in the same day and would never stuck again . 
this might be fine on a windless ,  airless planet . 
and they have worked without any problems for over a year . 
so ,  these seem to be the exact shirt . 
i think it prevents burn ,  leaves light tan . 
yup ,  right on a rug by the door . 
just a right amount of foam on the grip to hold the phone num_extend
i ordered one and had it within num_num days . 
nothing offensive about either the scent or feel of this product . 
i went outside and the sun was intolerable ,  so weird . 
i didn t feel this bra was supportive enough for me num_extend
which is funny because i love pink sugar ,  the original . 
i was very surprised look at my bright view finder . 
i probably would have given this item a num_num star review . 
i have ordered a different stove top popper with a stainless steel pan . 
the curlers do not hold heat long enough to get a curl . 
the urine leaks through the backing of the pad . 
usb cords just aren t able to survive in this kind of design . 
i wanted one for making meatballs and this is too small . 
amazon had the best price ,  so i ordered one . 
i still use it ,  but wish that it was a little smarter . 
i would avoid unless you want to replace them too soon . 
the game looks too flashy and the layout is way too complicated . 
these sleepers are so cheaply made ,  i am so disappointed . 
this one might even be a bit more so . 
only way to say your progress is by picking up save gems . 
would not buy this product again or would i recommend it to anyone . 
they each pulled on one side and it separated . 
the belly part does nothing to hold you in . 
i then ran it through the sharpener again  medium pressure ,  smooth pull  . 
failure to comply with this standard pretty much destroyed this game . 
for most people ,  it won t work with num_extend and up . 
i plan to return it and buy one of the smaller belts . 
the will fall off if you bend over to pick something up . 
it just looked completely plain ,  white ,  no shell coloring at all . 
i bought this to take fishing in the snake river canyon in idaho . 
as another reviewer pointed out ,  that does not mean % aloe . 
i am adjusting my rating ,  this sink stinks . 
please don t buy a charger with the phone . 
my favorite was spyro year of the dragon which was perfect . 
that is a fun twist on the usual random chatter . 
vitamins i am already getting in my multiple . 
save your time and effort ,  this product is not worth the trouble . 
got better as it warmed up ,  but never got num_extend
this is the worst pos brush i have ever bought . 
i gave it three stars as it was fun up to that point . 
i do get used to it overtime however . some good num_extend
it worked for about num_num char and would just stop working . 
failed out of the box to pump anything . 
this item came with a hole in it right out of the box . 
this kit doesn t do that ,  in my opinion . 
there has to be something comparable out there that actually works . 
nevertheless my two star rating will not be based on my painting fiasco . 
it was packaged secure and arrived as stated . 
i ve never had the dirty performance issues with the logitech product . 
as an alternative ,  i opted for the olay eye roller . 
this is a bold coffee ,  just as advertised . 
thought it would be better but was disappointed . 
so the seasoning mix is good ,  but the portion is very small . 
at num_num yards it was acceptable and i could clearly see bullet holes . 
well ,  it appears i got a bad one . 
after the first ,  my dog had num_num ticks within a week . 
delivery was fast ,  but these protectors for me r no good . 
i put these up in my yard around the fence line . 
it is not leather ,  and its smell is atrocious . 
it has like a vegetable garden flavor to it . 
it doesn t bring anything worth while to the table . 
i bought two of them on salefrom cvs @ $
they said they are aware of the problem . 
i opened the attachment ,  unbent the bended comb and put it back . 
i am currently on my num_extend case from this style . 
it was very nice for about an hour . 
but % of the time it can t find the phone . 
battery charge indicator went from % to % while still charging . 
i loved civ num_num back in the day and mastered it . 
lo quality glass and don t focus very well . 
no real strong flavor here and hardly sweet at all . 
the product worked well and my six cats used it without any problems . 
i ve heard they honor their warrenty just have a lot of requirements . 
what new mom wants to wear a harsh elastic around her rib cage . 
this was fun while it lasted ,  which was a few weeks . 
now that the incipio is in my life it s great for everything . 
the common caveat in my reviews is our cat is very picky . 
okay so i changed my comment on this . 
it is so cheap that i felt ripped off . 
so i am still looking for a teleconverter lens . 
my samsung vibrant s gps is also non functional . 
they used to sell them in num_extend bags and now they are num_extend
sealed and new ,  with no manual and no key code . 
mind you ,  i am not of the  buy american  crowd . 
but unfortunately that was not enough to save them ,  in my opinion . 
i was so excited !  but then ,  the downside comes along . 
the negatives being there s always competition to find the best groups . 
my biggest issue was that it bounces when jogging causing discomfort . 
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee . 
these things will burn off your tongue and throat . 
did not feel much of anything on my face . 
i live in the mountains of north ga . 
your boobs won t just flop around ,  they ll look freaky . 
i carried a ruger lcp in it for about two months . 
the hair ,  in about a weekend ,  became matted and ugly . 
my cat will not touch her food with this on it . 
while the leapster explorer is the most recent system from leapfrog . 
so these do fight well as compression shorts and the cup is flexible . 
maybe if they dialed the sweetness back it would be ok . 
you can get the same item with no added ingredients . 
i ve been using the soap for a three weeks . 
i bought this in the hope she would mellow out . 
by pushing a bunch of different buttons in order you make combos . 
throw it into the air and go boom !  . 
after all kinds of twists and turns i got it to work intermittently . 
wearing leather heels every day ,  my feet sweat a great deal . 
the game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was . 
the capsules suddenly became a  pale  shade of green . 
they do not work good and they took forever to come . 
the other dress is not quite as pretty anyway  . 
perhaps if you have barbie doll towels this will be worth your trouble . 
i usually love nature s path oatmeal but this was disappointing . 
i recommend trying other acacia fibers and avoiding heather s . 
i ve read for overweight people it can be quite effective . 
the same thing happened to my brother s screen . 
fiskar is known for its sharp tools and this product appears sturdy . 
their products are also chinese ,  but high quality . 
that s really not acceptable to have to worry about though . 
the rep confirmed that the cord setup was not a defect . 
not the thermometers fault ,  but it causes me problems . 
however ,  only one side works which is very very disappointing . 
it s your skin ,  buy something more costly and effective . 
within num_extend num_num minutes of use i nearly dropped my camera twice . 
i used this pill cutter to cut one pill a day . 
for those with little hands this controller is absolutely out of the question . 
warp num_num has less ships and the missions are pretty boring . 
i bought this to use in my daughter s nursery . 
like the beatles sang  i should have known better  . 
i m pretty sure they were mocking me as i tried . 
i noticed the same review from other people who bought this watch . 
i love how the company plants trees to offset the carbon footprint . 
the fit is spot on in my opinion . 
it does it with crossman bbs and the ones thwt come with it . 
i could barely get this thing through my hair . 
it feels good in your hand and still will slide in your pocket . 
i am actually pretty bummed about the fact that it does not glow . 
even on the high setting there is hardly any vibration . 
instead i had the enjoyment of staring into the menu screen of the num_extend
so it started to tears where the seams are . 
now i m looking into the oster beehive line close in price . 
thanks again to amazon for having a great return policy . 
kitchenaid needs to produce a cover that fits the pro num_num series . 
made in china all ove tv about the poison scare . 
i apply the gel directly onto the teeth using my index finger . 
we tried num_num sets of brand new batteries all to no avail . 
mine is going to goodwill since i threw the receipt away . 
i am totally at a loss for this game . 
this product didn t do a damn thing for my sensitive skin . 
thus ,  i don t think this costly towel is worth the money . 
they were also very tight through the thigh . 
please do yourself a favor and don t make the same mistake . 
i quit wearing the watch and the reaction went away . 
i bought this toy for my num_num month old . 
this clothes shaver is a waste of money . 
now it wont charge even from the controller . 
while the action is fast paced there are a lot of problems . 
however ,  i ordered this toy from online discounters . 
the problem is the cleaning cycle :  it just takes too long . 
this is my first purchase of amber jewelry  pendant with matching earrings  . 
does not make my hair look healthy or soft . 
i just don t think this is one of them . 
this table will sag in the middle num_num minutes after setting it up . 
so ,  that s approximately num_num cups before it died on me . 
i must say i was and still am quite disappointed with this product . 
i would buy this brand again ,  but just not this color . 
unit often fails to detect large people within num_num feet of sensor . 
my other games work fine ,  even those with internet verfication . 
the good : not really anything good but the game is really original . 
mine comes on about % of the time . 
the point and click aspect is only fun for so long . 
they looked worn and were an embarrassing gift . 
my recommendation is to buy a better power pack !  . 
when washing ,  or adjusting the hinges bop out . 
my num_num came with its own num_num gig hard drive . 
also ,  on further consideration ,  a num_extend megapixel camera is ludicrous nowadays . 
after reading all the great reviews ,  i ordered the product . 
with so much rust it would probably fail in a short time . 
i decided to purchase a smaller corner rack to stack my plates . 
i have never been so let down for a video game before . 
i would not do business with this seller again . 
frankly ,  people ought to be able to finish a game . 
my cat had fun with these but they are horrible quality . 
i had this for roughly a month when the receiver completely died . 
i never thought the handle would get anywhere near actual burning hot . 
they often get stuck just before the monkey . 
but i bought into all the num_num star reviews here . 
contacted seller who to their credit sent another case out . 
just thought i d add my vote to avoid this product . 
they are plastic and dig into your head . 
well ,  maybe for the first few hours after a fresh wash . 
it was not secure fit and lost it during the shooting . 
easy ,  quiet and gets the job done fast !  . 
but i found that router kept dropping my connection every few minutes . 
have a size large which is too big . 
i m very disappointed that i can t use this . 
but the design of this case it not useful to little hands . 
i bought one of these about num_extend years ago . 
the fleece cover has been washed several times but is still like new . 
i looked around and i wasn t sure what it was . 
you cannot actually hear what the other players are saying . 
thinking i was taking the bark ,  i swallowed an entire capsule . 
after that though ,  i would not buy it again . 
however ,  he forgot to mention how overpriced monster products are . 
i don t recommend for using to prevent snoring . 
returned the item and went back to a samsung flip phone . 
other things have to do with poor gameplay design . 
i am giving this product num_num stars now . 
this game is too old to be played . 
apart from all that ,  they seem like very nice jeans . 
this is another hyped product that does not live up to claims . 
scrlk + scrlk + end but it did not help . 
make sure you can return it if you get it . 
nowhere on the site did it mention this . 
this game is only for people that have never played pokemon before . 
even though the target date was estimated between jan num_num and jan num_extend
it doesn t even support the weight of the phone . 
but i soon wished i never applied this terrible product . 
it says is an  ageless  concealer and it does just the opposite . 
to add insult to injury ,  breast support is minimal . 
there is nothing special about this side dish . 
i don t understand all these positive reviews for these bars . 
it says num_num on it ,  which is sterling silver . 
at first i liked that these kept their teeth busy . 
this game is a crappy crossover to the psp . 
thank god it burned up in the first num_num minutes . 
for that much money i would expect better quality . 
the book lists num_num characters and i believe there are num_num songs . 
the only thing that is there in abudance is the spice . 
what a mess !  sadly ,  its not for my cats . 
claiming that it does a superior job of video capturing . 
the monoprice cables are cheap and thick as a piece of rope . 
i do not recommend this device to anyone !  !  . 
however ,  the cord ended up breaking after a few months . 
also ,  the enemies are recycled over and over . 
kept falling off while i was trying to use it . 
another thing is that the game is way too dark at times . 
this is where i have to question my rating . 
if you want grey boots ,  don t buy these . 
konriko contains no msg and has regular salt . 
i tend to brew at slightly cooler temperature anyway  tried num_extend to num_extend
they know this and use deliberately vague sales to lure you in . 
less than two years . phone call quality is fair to poor . 
later i realised the dvd player is faulty . 
it dried up a pimple i had almost overnight . 
i am allergic to both almonds and apricots . 
it still leaked badly after taking it for a ride . 
he likes it and it s reasonably well built ,  for plastic . 
pyrex and anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop . 
the button which dispenses the product becomes stiff within a few pumps . 
it doesn t cover any of the crust to keep it from burning . 
i even tried taking off the autosync feature to save battery life . 
it s only a shame you can t beat scenarios on multiplayer first . 
i got the tortoise brown with smoke lenses . 
i love skechers but these were a huge disappointment . 
what the heck ,  right ? and i fell in love with it . 
i used it on a small hole on my leather couch . 
this was much wasted effort on the part of my middle finger . 
and for their price ,  i expected longer usability . 
my husband suffers from nacolepsy and he could not take it either . 
that s the only advice i can give you . 
play the demo that is downloadable from the official site . 
speakers were delivered and one woiuld not turn on . 
the hip action salmon flavor was very disappointing indeed . 
the product while blue looking was just a gritty clear substance when handled . 
a tiny led light is the only function . 
this unit was easy to install and set up . 
i was unable to use the earphones without opening the flap . 
sorry ea ,  but your baseball title sucks the big fattie !  . 
this pump is utterly useless for presta valves . 
these are not the same hanes you bought num_num years ago . 
it s probably the most ignorant product design i ve seen . 
these used to taste natural ,  but now more like cardboard . 
after about a month the clasp gives out and won t stay shut . 
there s no point in them being in the game . 
ended up getting rid of the age spots by laser . 
unfortunately ,  they suck ,  so i wouldn t recommend them . 
guess i will keep searching for an answer to his allergies . 
the timberland pros are better constructed and $ cheaper . 
it was embarrassing . needless to say ,  i ve returned these shoes . 
it still has loads of sugar in it . 
not clever ,  not fun for long ,  and not recommended . 
it s one of those games you can t interact with . 
these two layers are connected together at the top and bottom . 
i was able to zero it at num_num yards . 
sega s espn hockey updates are true to the game . 
right out of the box these worked  ok  . 
the quality was not good ,  and very staticy . 
but the problem came when i used siri to make a phone call . 
when it comes to monsters you have to hack and slash or run . 
this provides the kind of protection that i was looking for . 
we doubled the amount and were still disappointed with the results . 
did not get hungry yet i knew i had to eat . 
when we started using one ,  it stopped after num_num weeks . 
this stuff tastes like arse mixed with jager . 
i love the grandia series . let me repeat that . 
she has never had difficulty chomping through a bone before these . 
for essentially the same price you get two brushes . 
nasty stuff falls into the water turning it colors . 
the sonic series has been doing very well recently . 
the worst part is that it has too much texture . 
this is not a life threatening allergenic reaction . 
protein is only num_num gram in a cup . 
it seems utterly ridiculous that it would have a list price of $
as i added more fish ,  now i over stocked my tank . 
my hair can curl with curling irons but not this one !  . 
i wonder if i would ve had better luck with the old formula . 
it is a filler ingredient in the true sense of the word . 
it s small and it s light ,  as is the controller . 
it certainly doesn t compare to medieval total war . 
maybe for some people but definitely not everyone . 
these are num_num of the most important buttons for me on the headset . 
nintendo sucks now with the exception of the num_extend
i tried these in num_num pair of running shoes . 
this seat cover does not fit at all . 
second reason is that the game play and levels are so damn repetitive . 
it s only $ or $ and i like it better . 
save yourself some grief and buy something else . 
i do not find that kind of difficulty to be enjoyable . 
then whenever i try to start it i get directx num_extend errors . 
the plastic is so soft it doesnt stay in the ear . 
calling this a waffle iron is a long stretch of the truth . 
the vermicelle has absolutly no flavor on it s own what so ever . 
i am afraid to eat food from japan since fukushima happened . 
while it was working ,  it did what i expected it to do . 
good thing i saved my receipt; it s going back to the store . 
well ,  i have a subcompact  taurus num_num slim  and tried it out . 
even by the low standards of indian food in foil pouches . 
the order service from the supplier was great . 
then forget how to play the next day . 
until one day when i had a tuna lunchable . 
but it s a thick glass jug in your kitchen and cabinet . 
i could only get to the first boss . 
the only good thing we kept was the utensil holder . 
my cats hate the noise this makes when they step on it . 
this turned out to be a complete waste of money . 
i was hoping for a more natural pomegranate taste . 
it was perfect ,  until i had to open it again . 
the guide that surrounds the blade is a cheap piece of clear plastic . 
there are better ones out there and for less money too . 
then after a while it seems the motor gets weak . 
i cannot imagine that it will last for more than a few months . 
i rather have the loud headphone ,  because i m deaf . 
also ,  since switching my itchy belly and skin sensitivity are gone . 
it is too hard for him to put together himself  he is num_extend
the stench they live behind is quite strong . 
i took this item out of the box . 
the gooseneck attachment broke at the suction cup . 
the instructions are poorly written ,  and make no sense . 
it feels cold and i prefer a very warm feel . 
this is the second belt that i have purchased from amazon . 
after receiving my product ,  i tested all of the cables . 
on top of that ,  the bristles seem to be dyed black . 
this means you have to open them by force . 
obviously that means it didn t taste very good to him . 
do not buy !  not even with the num_num star . 
i removed the blades and put them and the bowl into the dishwasher . 
this most awful computer game i ve ever played . 
now getting the base on the card board is more difficult . 
i tried these and my female cat couldn t stand them . 
the shading and textures of the weapons look terrible . 
i can t believe i spent this much on a rawhide bone . 
do not last and early failure makes this product a waste of num_extend
as in ,  green ,  red ,  and other colors growing . 
we bought this for my daughter last year . 
i couldnt send or receive picture messages and the bluetooth stunk . 
i tried them in conjunction with drinking tea and still nothing . 
perhaps they were intended for people with very small heads . 
that is better also since i stopped taking it . 
made my face worse with this and neutragena oil free acne wash . 
chlorine ,  in its natural state ,  is a poisonous gas . 
the glass is very thick ,  but not quality . 
all other computers work with the wireless router ,  mac and windows . 
and still trojan horses would infect the server . 
i returned it and am very disappointed with my purchase . 
i still use it ,  but i would never buy another one . 
it basically just shrank most of the granules . 
i find it works when the spray directly hits a flea . 
there are definitely better play food options out there . 
our num_extend son just turned num_extend and celebrated his num_extend christmas . 
there s a sort of smoky ,  barbeque sauce thing going on . 
i bought passed on the favorable  star  rating . 
there is nothing to configure ,  fix ,  or tweak . 
you really have to slam it hard to get it to work . 
the brand is made in america and the quality and heft seemed impressive . 
i tried this on a crock pot dish ,  braised lamb shank . 
the addition of new pitch types was a good change . 
these seem to overheat and die after about a year . 
there just isn t any consistency in how it behaves . 
after about num_num uses cookies stuck to it just like a cookie sheet . 
weaver does make higher end mounts but this line is marginal at best . 
totally useless when it comes to adding on to other thomas trackmaster sets . 
i found that my old clearasil spot treatment works much better . 
they look great together . the problem is with making smoothies . 
in my opinion ,  outlaw golf isn t a good solid game . 
i will never buy another linksys product now . 
i won t make another mistake and buy a voyager pro though . 
then you get a couple seconds of control . 
this phone case is extremely cheap and looks it . 
i sold it within just a couple of days . 
i realize that manly men do not want to use flowery smelling lotion . 
it serves the purpose of somewhat protecting iphone . 
we have since tried a water based lubricant which is great . 
now the thing dosnt even allow audio signal through . 
this one does not have the notch so it will not fit . 
i m tired of popcorn batches that taste like burnt cardboard . 
great price and color but the case is not matched for iphone . 
i don t know why anyone would need this . 
the reviewers who have stated that this is not memory foam are correct . 
the time system in this game is ridiculous . 
i left reeking of construction worker and coconuts . 
so ,  i guess my kids will get them sometime next year . 
when we first opened this game ,  we were all excited . 
i sent it back to tiffen for a warranty repair . 
would like a refund to say the least . 
i m sure my son would have loved it if it worked . 
when i used this on him ,  he seriously scratched me . 
my oldest ate it ,  but said it was not that good . 
this item rattles like crazy in my jeep now . 
my cat just smelled the treats then just walked away . 
the batteries can be dramatically overcharged and may well explode . 
this is disappointing because the executions have become more gruesome and interesting . 
after a time i began to feel this whenever i wore them . 
plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast . 
this was not the product that gave me this . 
i m going to continue my search for the perfect clippers . 
its a worst product i have ever seen by motorola . 
grand daughters used the skeletal form of this until they tired of it . 
but then it should be noted that i m a pretty picky eater . 
the boxes they came in were in good shape . 
i bought this product for a num_extend notebook . 
everyone who comes into my kitchen comments on it . 
its also only num_num servings and would not put on any serious mass . 
she must of been paid for that video . 
i have waited num_num weeks since my original order . 
stick with the traditional version and do it yourself !  . 
do i take a fantastic shots everytime ?  of course not . 
try the golden valley jerky also here at amazon . 
scholl work shoes and walked to the supermarket and back with them . 
we won t even mention how very large and heavy the base is . 
it did not work on my android pad . 
only the beltclip part was in the packaging . 
this product tastes awful and didn t give anyone in my family energy . 
the big problem is that it is uncompatible with my cell phone . 
another problem my previous pans did not have . 
i ve gone thru two of these units now . 
we used our shower normally and every day i checked its status . 
the royal robbins shorts were the only pair that i ended up returning . 
i will be throwing them all in the garbage . 
also eat healthier and drink less  some of us  . 
obviously my opinion differs from the rest of you . 
personally this was the deal breaker for me . 
i sent back and got the nv ,  the cadillac of strollers . 
keep your olive oil in a bottle instead . 
i will never buy blades again from an online seller . 
after several weeks ,  the analog part of the watch started running slow . 
this is is a game from a long line of diablo clones . 
it certainly was easy to prepare ,  just cut the top and microwave . 
it works ok in some areas and terrible in other areas . 
there have been kindergarten plays with better acting . 
the other is just not turning on at all . 
why you ask ?  here you read for your self . 
motorola still has quite a good thing going with the num_extend
the same problems noted above were observed with the second unit . 
very disappointing !  i do not recommend this product . 
put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic num_num string . 
especially the saves . the graphics were okay but rather child like . 
i wasn t too fond of the smell either . 
however ,  the pictures were very small and a bit hard to read . 
this filter is the biggest piece of trash i have ever used . 
i m still hooked to the old bag vacuum . 
this is the worst james bond game i ve ever played . 
overall this is not an especially horrible daily sunscreen moisturizer . 
i would advise you to use a eye glasses wipe . 
the left channel stopped working after num_num months . 
i still need a nikon remote but would hesitate to order this one . 
i bought these bars to eat while doing the atkins diet . 
we learned from the previous model to purchase the extended num_num yr . 
didn t work at all and i followed directions precisely . 
a very ,  clunky ,  front heavy with light stock type of gun . 
the cabinet was shipped in its retail packaging . 
do not rely on iron serum levels to determine your total iron status . 
for $ this product is unusable and inexcusable . 
and it takes so looooong to get past this . 
the salmon pasta and three beans are highly recommended on the hand . 
the purple was less pigmented than the rust . 
however ,  it broke within a couple of days . 
if you want nostalgic effect ,  go ahead and play this game . 
hopefully they ll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess . 
if dropped the case comes right off the phone . 
and i wouldn t put it with my other pots and pans either . 
a drop of glue by the manufacturer probably would do the trick . 
it can also be a lot of fun . 
this stylus was exactly what i was looking for aesthetically . 
may be good for folks num_num and under . 
it did not even smell like real moroccan oil . 
i have to force my phone on the stand to charge it . 
the quality of the curcumin num_num is fine . 
for true vets ,  live lost it when num_extend hit the scene . 
on paper ,  this could be the ideal laptop bag . 
this is a toy for kids to fix them a breakfast . 
the first level is fine ,  but the second level gets you . 
then time caught up and passed palm by . 
these are the best speakers i have had so far . 
i guess it is just a matter of preference . 
when you use less litter because of this everything sticks . 
but ,  the soft balls work great for fetch in the house . 
that part broke ,  it is weak and thin . 
they have played with them about num_num mins . 
actually ,  i think it s both of those reasons . 
not an optimal ingredient ,  as we are learning . 
constantly slid down the refrigerator with very little weight . 
i also find grinds in my coffee everywhere . 
also i hate having to unlock the stuff in the buy mode . 
the quality is obviously better than this cable . 
however ,  i have deep skepticism about this type of footwear . 
my dog slipped it out in num_num minute and gobbled it up . 
i sweat how i want it never stops . 
my problem is with what this is designed to do . 
just spend a little more money and buy a better case . 
power :  this device requires a continuous power source . 
nowhere in the pictures or description is plastic mentioned . 
for num_num years and it was time for a new flatiron . 
but once i rinsed my hair that changed . 
bought this product thinking it s good due to the review . 
this bra might have been nice if i was able to use it . 
then another time i expected bland and got pretty spicy . 
you would think that this company would of realized that by now . 
have to remove case every time to charge not good . 
it charges and holds charge when i m on the road . 
there are others out there that are much more comfortable and less bulky . 
the product that was sent to me does not work . 
the stock photo of the blue color is way off . 
i just slip the wooden trap inside one of those bags . 
the quality of the screen protector is poor . 
this food processor is compact and easy to operate . 
you can t even change the default admin password  . 
i really love oxo products so i was excited to get this . 
what did not last was the dynamo as a power source . 
i really didn t like it and wouldn t buy it . 
it s similar ,  but nearly everything is done better . 
you have inaccurate reporting of an unknown mix of variables . 
like num_extend you either like it or dont . 
we sent the part back ,  they claimed they never received it . 
my four cats were not crazy about this cat food . 
bought this based on the many positive reviews on amazon . 
probably would not have held up many washes . 
i put this in her juice like i do any vitamins or medicine . 
a monster spawns behind you ,  and you kill it . 
i prefer the sole products as they are the cream of the crop . 
please check water soluble vitamins on any nutritional site or wikipedia etc . 
what i got was a dfx sports ball . 
some babies get scared just looking at the penguin . 
i don t know if this is true but mine definitely did not . 
polk ought to be ashamed to have their name on this product . 
we bought two gallons of wet and forget at costco . 
i also got an ugly ,  dull blue color . 
he spoke with nary an accent ,  and in perfectly understandable english . 
we bought this hoping to come slowly off our addiction to energy shooters . 
it s not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either . 
i shopped for a num_extend and i never wanted a num_extend
give this player a miss and wait for the num_extend generation num_extend players . 
not sure why ,  maybe she is just really picky . 
didnt seem to help my  not to serious  indigestion or heartburn . 
this product does not replace the authentic item . 
have gone through num_num of these  under impression first num_num were defective  . 
so ,  no ,  i wouldn t recommend this item to purchase . 
it was not made as great as i had hoped . 
it was horrible and the bag is indeed too big . 
some colors do not have this design and some do . 
time will tell whether my dirt devils will hold up . 
this is the fastest ten bucks i have wasted . 
the first thing i noticed was that your food sweats on the plate . 
battery time on the panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here . 
it lacked the real snap of a ginger cookie in taste and texture . 
with the intense sun we had this summer ,  it faded pretty quickly . 
i wish i had integrated bluetooth in my car . 
it hurts my fingers to even pull them out . 
luckily it hasn t happened because he can t actually push it together . 
tech support solved some issues ,  but couldn t resolve the signal loss . 
since then ,  it seems like it doesn t work at all . 
these brushes are very stiff and poor quality . 
i don t know of any pistol that would fit in this case . 
but what s the point of having a wired bluetooth ?  ?  . 
however ,  as usual ,  i was very pleased with amazon . 
all the older maxell discs would play in everything . 
lasted about a year ,  then they fell apart . 
the graphics are beyond bad and the game itself is insanely difficult . 
i have a dog that tends to gulp food . 
one of the arms connecting the handle to the screen rim has broken . 
i prefer the logitech optical mouse i use at work . 
the product itself has no flavoring other than what you add . 
it doesnt stay on at all ,  which is frustrating . 
we can t afford to buy special memory for each and every device . 
you ll have to stop and allow the motor to cool down . 
i put a little oil on the joint but that didn t help . 
this product is overpriced for what you are getting . 
the level design is also very retro and original . 
these fit true to size around the waist . 
it invariably would transform a % signal into a % signal . 
i was absolutely shocked at how awful the chunky chocolate chip cookies were . 
oz purports it to help low back pain and inflammation . 
all of them say i sound muffled or underwater . 
this item was on sale at a beauty supplies store . 
this product leave a metallic taste in my mouth . 
we didn t bring it out until they were num_num months old . 
it is not educational besides the pins are animals . 
their is only num_num thing good about it . 
number two is the product has a wierd aftertaste . 
i have dry sensitive skin and was hoping for a cheap foundation . 
the water flushes through quickly resulting in a weak cup of tea . 
i mean it ,  not a single one of them even came close . 
this is clearly a used or refurbished battery . 
save your money and get the hungry hippo by fisher price . 
i figure there has to be a reason why the dog hates it . 
the old doors were much stronger and easier to install . 
i can t even return it since ups screwed up on the return . 
they have never arrived yet and it s been a couple of mos . 
turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it . 
just leave a note as a comment to this review . 
i have these ,  and they did nothing to offer me support . 
i will not try this again and am back to shaving . 
i won t eat this and have wasted my money . 
the plastic impeller does mulch ,  but not terribly finely . 
hopefully the next bond game will kick this ones fat . 
if it weren t for that it would get a num_extend
this flat edge could also be a chisel . 
my kids had this and other similar toys . 
i just bought one of these from target . 
i could not believe how disappointing this was . 
this thing broke after the num_extend time i used it . 
just hated it was not able to endure a lit of pressure !  . 
there is not too much to this game . 
its nice to rent if you are saving up for a good game . 
the only plus side about these speakers is the cabinet finish . 
it s just too plain and flat on the forehead . 
i do not recommend this pyrex measuring cup . 
it is very attractive but is completely plastic . 
the base is the heavier part ,  weighing a few pounds . 
sonic num_extend blast is quite different from the num_extend sonic games on genesis . 
i just received this product yesterday ,  tried it and hated it . 
sadly ,  they dont seem to have any fun in them . 
it made like a toy and does not sound loud . 
something went wrong in the arctic zero kitchen on this one . 
but that could be my hair is short . 
it looks very feminine . i was really hoping for straight leg num_extend
this was not loud enough for use in my semi truck . 
i think i will stick to my neutrogena micromist thank you . 
in the bios the hot keys will switch between computers too . 
it s truly worthless and should be banned from being sold on amazon . 
i highly suggest that you do not buy this game . 
wrong !  learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating . 
the puzzle is random so it s a new route everytime . 
our german shepherd puppy ripped it a part in num_num days . 
given the low price ,  it might be worth experimenting with . 
i really want one with a larger wider basket . 
i ve never bled like i did with these shoes . 
it did not hold up for more and num_num minutes . 
consumer reports november num_num issue found that most rice harvested in texas . 
i would rather wear cheaper rubber flip flops than these . 
i say no one lives forever is crap . 
this mouse isn t for people with serious arthritis like my mom . 
would give it zero stars if i could . 
they don t make anything like they used to i guess . 
i am very sorry that i bought it . 
the scrolling engine alone makes this game unplayable . 
these screen protectors came as part of a combo purchase recommended by amazon . 
i won t even describe the problems with installing batteries and attaching pads . 
but she has figured out a new game . 
cats don t seem to like it much because it s so noisy . 
i bought num_num of these from yosemite bicycles . 
there weren t that many different dishes to make . 
so ,  for me ,  this was a big letdown . 
also they already had a small scratch on one side . 
it is a scent that you will have to get used to . 
i currently use skinceuticals retinol num_extend refining night cream . 
after this all emails and ads from amazon will go to my spam . 
purchased from ulike ,  the digitizer arrived after a month and was defective . 
you can choose some great accessories for it . 
your children will probably be disappointed as my son num_extend
the game itself is simple too annoying to play . 
i owned the previous model num_extend standard  and installed it with no problem . 
it smells like someone poured pine sol in the bottle but worse . 
there is no way to choose body blow v . 
the ones they label as  hard  are as easy as those labeled  easy  . 
the body fell apart from all the crashing . 
in some product designs ,  longevity and usability are not the key factors . 
i used it several times and found it difficult to properly shave . 
i didn t feel noticeably different in any way during the day . 
this is so annoying it feels like you are controlling an elephant . 
i now know why the price was so low . 
three hours after i bought this game i had beaten every stage . 
i could not find a comfortable place to clip on the bluetooth transmitter . 
also ,  the number shape pieces are cut too tightly . 
nursing mothers have very sore breasts ,  especially in the beginning . 
slow online play and small amount of people to play as . 
they offer poor protection to your phone and nothing else but color . 
i gave my girls pet shop vips last year for christmas . 
i consume raw seeds ,  not roasted or num_extend
so the only good thing about this game is the creativity . 
be sure to keep your receipt to obtain service under the warranty . 
there was friction it squeaked and felt like it was about to break . 
by month num_extend the sole completely slit away from the slipper . 
however ,  there hasn t been any noticeable difference on my skin . 
sub died and would make aloud buzzing noise . 
i am forced to conclude primal defense has no living microbes . 
and it moves from side to side pretty easily . 
not worth sending it back because it didn t cost me much . 
lastly ,  the power button has a very slight angle to it . 
you are not getting a bargain from thisamazon seller . 
so the search for something that will actually work continues . 
to get above and below areas is a chore . 
i got this for $ at big lots . 
the other colors  same brand  don t clump like this one . 
swinging bars of doom  series num_extend  japanese :  slip through the num_extend
i was really looking forward to receiving this . 
the amount of food recommended was too much food for the dog . 
and it also gave the screen this weird green discoloration . 
it does not even help a little bit . 
well ,  at first it was all right and all . 
i also can t tell that the wash is doing anything . 
the samsung people have provided a contact email for problems . 
my num_num lbs dog nearly swallowed this toy . 
i was also impressed with the bagel ,  defrost ,  and reheat settings . 
the color is too light and they are a bit big . 
don t believe all the hype about this one . 
but for them ,  with this converter ,  you re out of luck . 
first ,  the covering is this polyester material which is sort of scratchy . 
i strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology . 
there is a lot of apps ,  but some of it is junk . 
please do research about this machine before you buy it . 
i have this switch behind a dsl modem . 
you can use shells to open boxes and kill enemies . 
too bad burt s bees sold out to clorox . 
i ended up buying the full doggie car seat it works perfect . 
the price is not available yet to comment upon . 
first ,  the features are more limited than i expected . 
it was goo in the middle for the longest time . 
couldn t protect your forearm from a strong rubber band in my opinion . 
they made my heart flutter ,  upset stomach ,  nausea and finally vomiting . 
wouldn t recommend to nobody who don t like musky harsh smellls . 
kept the ones that i had already used ,  and reurned the rest . 
i find myself still keeping the old wooden ones around as spares . 
i plan to give mine to goodwill; they are that painful . 
i can t believe that people actually like this garbage . 
also you will wan num_num use cold refrigerated water num_num carbonate with . 
i used it everyday ,  twice a day for num_num months . 
this speaker could not even withstand the power of num_extend
when u try num_num turn u go fast and out of control . 
this camera is not recommended for the following num_extend

if you are big do not buy these bras . 
their hard rubber toys are excellent ,  but avoid the stuffed . 
nothing else in my regime changed except this mascara . 
it has num_num b vitamins to enhance energy naturally . 
i had not forced it back on tightly enough . 
since we got this at % off ,  we debated returning it . 
however the big volume control and the folded headset are huge . 
in other words ,  her perception of this tea matched mine . 
most of the items are loose ,  and get all jumbled up . 
for now ,  i ll go back to my corded intellimouse explorer . 
additionally if the watch was unrepairable they would not send a replacement watch . 
it opens better but still not very good . 
the num_extend jack is cool ,  i mean it fits in the phone . 
the only redeeming quality of this gun is the quick reloads . 
the only way to blow up other cars is to run into them . 
ouch !  don t waste your money on the norelco num_extend
this product does not seem to keep algae away at all . 
it has moisturizers to make the underarms smoother . 
however ,  it sounds better than it is in reality . 
but this workbench does little more than make noises . 
i tried it with and without cloth strips . 
i would say that this stuff made them more excitable . 
item was scratched and broken when it arrived . 
maybe i ll try it again and see if i missed something . 
its too hard to get in and out of the pocket . 
it also does not snug completely to the num_extend
give your kid an orange or a a glass of orange juice instead . 
i have gotten better results using a high quality pellet carbon . 
i just really ,  really wish it fit like it should have . 
unfortunately this might not really be a game . 
the bra just makes me look like im num_extend
battery is same as the battery that came with it . 
i consume mainly consume greens as well as salmon ,  sardines and sprats . 
there s no reinforcement on the short sides; they re just fabric . 
now i know that i made the correct decision with this review . 
i ll be trying another product ,  and would not recommend this one . 
i was so frustrated with the customer service i just gave up . 
i m trying out the offering from philips next . 
i threw it in the trash a waste of money . 
the light is now shorting out !  there is water in the light . 
thus i have to find another box to ship it in . 
this and most supplements are literally money down the drain . 
i ll stick with the lotion and maybe try the gel . 
i applied it religiously hoping to avoid stretch marks . 
i will have to find a better option to get my crunch . 
i found two issues with the design ,  though . 
once that happens ,  the butter migrates under the glaze and turns rancid . 
i wonder what the verizon cord would have been like ?  . 
i am still in search of the undereye product . 
in my opinion rockstar copped out when it came to adding replay value . 
i expected it to cover my phone buttons but it did not . 
after about an hour of trying ,  we gave up . 
i had to unplug the mic if i wanted to talk to anyone . 
also the flexible part is an iron rod so not very flexible . 
the supplies are very expensive and cant be substituted . 
i do love my crocs ,  don t get me wrong . 
different when you receive it in the mail . 
it is also missing an angled eyeliner brush . 
lets start with some details and what this game does right first . 
if you want to play desert storm ,  invite num_num friends over . 
my advice is to go to a store and try on some hats . 
having said that ,  the campaign is not awesome . 
so really for the money it s a good size . 
the screen protectors come off the side of the phone . 
the audio quality seems comparable and more importantly ,  it s still working . 
it s rear claws scratched up the cabinet doors . 
this will be my last api filstar filter . 
i just couldn t get over the strange texture and flavor . 
but the fun part is that you ll enjoy them all !  . 
turning off the vhs unit didn t help ,  hitting stop ,  etc . 
they should last for decades and not begin decaying after the first use .

i had to return it but i did like the look . 
all your characters look the same . not very fun or impressive .

gameplay ,  controls ,  and graphics all need major work . 
bad vision bath tub !  now i have two very dirty birdies . 
that worried me ,  so i sent it back . 
a terrific fantasy ,  but sadly  too good to be true  . 
you can accomplish a better job by using cotton balls and tin foil . 
it is overpriced for just a single phone charger . 
i didn t delve in it for too long . 
i wish i has purchased metal cans instead of plastic . 
it has been sitting in my drawer since . 
this product i m reviewing is way over priced . 
while the size was big enough ,  the absorbent material was rather thin . 
will only let me now making basic loaves . 
these cases are for people who need a solution for really rugged situations . 
i further investigated the cause of the malfunction . 
the side panels are not wide enough to smooth it out . 
i do like some of their other available flavors a little bit . 
i liked my zire num_num until i tried to use it outside . 
the picture is authentic so i added it to my clip art .

i attempted to knock koivu down with a body check by domi . 
i was hoping for something not as tough and grainy .

this product should be taken off the market . 
the red cap stayed intact but the hook end dangled from the pole .

i received one num_extend bar to evaluate and i m grateful for that . 
with this poor performance they are much too expensive . 
also ,  i could smell my self within num_num hours . 
tastes horrible ,  and does not affect mood at all . 
third ,  i stepped on it and it bowed . 
the bass management redirects the bass from the l ,  r ,  etc . 
it kept peeling up around the edges and collecting dirt and looked nasty . 
probably good for oily skin but certainly not for mature dry skin !  . 
however ,  the sizing is small when compared with crocs women s size num_extend
stick with the teardrop and the penguin and you ll be fine . 
then they re shot out again in less than num_num seconds . 
dietary fiber and num_num calories with num_extend of it from fat  . 
i cant say i am completely unhappy with this device .

i do not think it is worth purchasing . 
plugged two of these into a tube ,  no luck . 
this lotion temporarily moisturized but also left my skin feeling greasy . 
i purchased it and it worked absolutely great . 
it smelled great so i was really excited to try it . 
time and money wasted on my end again . 
and it doesn t fully seal into a close with the two parts . 
this protein powder is too processed for my tastes . 
i guess i was giving the benefit of the doubt . 
the bottle started turning when i lowered the small levers . 
the back of the pendant is a giveaway on the lack of quality .

then comes this new version after all this time . 
i got it when i first bought my chinchilla . 
press get navigate and the phone will speak you the directions . 
on the positive side ,  the popcorn flavor came through loud and clear . 
one of which was the large intellibone puzzle . 
i use nars powder blushes ,  and they are all heavily pigmented . 
i can barely make out what people are saying even at max volume . 
well worth the money you invest in them . 
they just felt like you were wearing a thick cloth diaper . 
it was suggested i use plain white tissues with no color or lotions . 
i m pretty sure there is nearly zero magnesium in it . 
i had been using a brand that was in a foil packet . 
this router has always acted strange with both of my macs . 
no problem with a firewire num_num connection to older macbook num_extend
completely unnecessary ,  and xylichew gum does not contain it . 
i wouldn t even say photos were were better than nothing .

at first ,  the case seemed to be a godsend . 
i read the reviews ,  did research and chose this model . 
i have short hair ,  but not short enough . 
story is tertiary no matter what people try to sell me on .

i prefer that my hair move in the breeze . 
needless to say i will not be buying from them again . 
if we try to fix it ,  it ll probably break . 
getting this just right is no small feat . not recommended . 
you can use code num_extend for a discount .

in the end ,  you can barely see the cars in the way . 
this is potentially a huge differentiator for windows phones . 
fortunately ,  amazon was willing to accept the return . 
unless you want a cool looking box cutter then ok go for it . 
i returned them ,  mostly because of the sized . 
i started doing one eye only to prove it . 
i will post any superior seat i find . kone . 
i think it s just a way for sony to rip people off . 
the handle kept slipping around in my hand . 
the map cover ,  a pink bumper ,  and a bottom bumper . 
been using these stovetop espresso maker s for num_num years . 
we re going to put a bungee cord around it or something . 
this adapter does not capture some of the key release . 
and the concept for ico is a good one . 
things start breaking until you can no longer run the pot . 
defeats the purpose of handsfree if i have to hold them in . 
num_num tiny pieces that when assembled make office furniture . 
this hurt me so i gave it to good will . 
when ordering the order application kept switching to size num_extend
the vanilla has a strong stevia aftertaste ,  but is not horrible . 
hello its me again the expert game player . 
i;m rating it a one as it didn t work for me . 
like the title says it breaks very easy . 
didn t truly use it enough to determine if it worked or not . 
the locking mechanism for the handle seems to be much weaker than anticipated . 
i like the anime style and the connection to norse myth i believe . 
these headbands were much too tight for me . 
wild ride in the sky  included with the game   japanese :  sky num_extend
the second one worked ,  but didn t quite feel right . 
it s a great doll on it own and our daughter loves her . 
ammonia and nitrites were reading at the highest level on the chart . 
i do not recommend this product for any price . 
the next day i woke up drained ,  exhausted , no energy . 
it s great fun if you have the money now . 
whatever way you wanted to get them ,  you could . 
i called the company that had come out to my house . 
the price is great the delivery was o . k . 
gnu banana nut bread is much better and has a lot more fiber . 
i am returning it for a refund in the morning . 
the num_extend is the all around best so far . 
however shortly after i got it the bottle part broke . 
the rope was the first part to be destroyed . 
like you could still totally see the screen regardless . 
all that detective work  reporter work actually for nothing . 
following this short period ,  there was a sudden change in my hair . 
this cover didn t fit as snugly or flush with my phone . 
the only sore spots are actually when different actors quote the movies  lines . 
spend the extra $ to get the authentic product . 
and guess what ?  it didn t charge my cell phone . 
rescue ,  mixed breed with frontline plus for several years . 
he recommended it as a safe supplement to take to increase energy . 
they fit perfectly on both my num_num pound havenese mixes . 
i don t think this should be advertised as a nutrition drink . 
after num_num hours of frustration ,  i finally returned the wap . 
like a person or several kids could fit inside of it . 
this is another reason it gives halo num_num that unreal and quake feel . 
at close to $ sony s official memory card is way overpriced . 
this device really has great features for the price point . 
there is something seriously wrong with the product . 
on the fourth sip i had to spew it back into the cup . 
it works perfectly fine but fuzz is unacceptable to me . 
i ended up ordering a grind to fit pad . 
i wanted something small and compact and attractive . 
we are disapointed ,  the plastic is cheaply made ,  and easily breaks . 
i absolutely loved this product until i realized it contained phenoxyethanol . 
there was nothing there that should have done that . 
the shop was also unwilling to help and said it would cost $
luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase . 
i really wish ghirardelli avoids soy or uses organic soy . 
now have fun spending num_num + mil again just to level it up . 
i don t see any change to my skin after using it . 
as it is now ,  we can t do that . 
i love nearly all the flavors of this brand . 
this product does not do what it claims . 
it is extremely accurate at representing it the way i know the game . 
so i gave devacurl a try and started shampooing every other day . 
the blades are not sharp for effective blending . 
sugar is very high on the list of contents of this diet drink . 
this is a very delicate tripod and one that breaks very easily . 
i m a tech junkie and love trying out new products . 
this device was exceptionally difficult to install and set up . 
too bad since it s not a bad looking pair of pants . 
attach the hose to the wand ,  attach other end to bottle . 
it is like a num_num hour advanced character creator . 
i ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster . 
i have continued to use the wax but have seen no improvement . 
recently the tops around the edges are actually shearing off . 
these are almost the worst  microwave  plates i ve ever used . 
i can t make myself eat the rest of the box . 
hooray for two companies which i m quickly loosing respect for . 
i got num_num of these just because i love omlettes so much . 
i used it for num_num months and no results . 
i was advised to spend the extra money . 
not unless you ve got the strength of a titan . 
this was not something i can settle for . 
you can only do this from a windows computer . 
it is slightly bitter ,  but not unpleasantly so . 
this only caused my refugium to bubble over and my levels to fluctuate . 
the last for this shoe must be for a very odd foot . 
it looks real nice in the picture but that s where it ends . 
it came in the mail quickly but i am unhappy with this purchase . 
talking to individuals you come across can be very entertaining and helpful . 
this holding spray does nothing for my hair . 
in a pinch maybe but i don t care for it . 
they are thin though so not good for someone who is not delicate . 
this flatiron is quite disappointing i was trying to get rid of frizz . 
and ,  that is what makes it so fun . 
theres nothing more annoying than waiting for carpet to dry . 
within a mine my skin started to melt and bubble . 
i sent the item back for a refund . 
poor design and even worse dexterity of the lock . 
the game was over in two or three hours . 
this product does not minimize the look of wrinkles . 
we decided to try a less expensive brand . 
it makes the game challenging ,  but not in a fun way . 
wow ,  worst thing about this product is the shipping . 
the vac system works fine but these canisters are junk  !  !  !  . 
i got accosted at the mall today by a smooth talker . 
the waxy buildup is just too much for my hair . 
luckily ,  there s a little access slot to unjam the coins . 
this did not work well for an num_num pound cat . 
in my order i requested a new dryer . 
don t want to put a $ phone in it . 
in a single serving of one can the pure sugar content is num_extend
absolutely frustrating . many people said to use manual mode . 
the cable impedance is wrong which creates ghosts in the image . 
there is also no way to adjust the plastic piece . 
they have hardly any bounce in them at all . 
played it from start to finish and ,  well . 
never really worked properly with my iphone and i never use it . 
i tried a lexar sd card ,  no problems . 
this item never made it to my parakeet . 
sugar is the second ingrediant listed and you can taste it . 
it s another  abandoned world full of weird machines  game . 
the blades are not pulling any extra air in . 
the briefs  more like a traditional diaper  has a plastic waterproof exterior . 
the  his  formula was okay just as a standard lubricant . 
i did everything correctly but my results could not be determined . 
why ?  ?  hopefully waiting for them to take out the sugar . 
i notice its worse when the video is bright . 
i don t recommend them unless you know they fit . 
the small bowl shape is a real mess to try and clean . 
there is no way i can wear these and be comfortable . 
the usb cable for iphone is not at all working . 
the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other . 
now i have learned my lesson when considering these dove products . 
blood test is the only way to see the affects . 
 i was not looking ,  only hearing this interaction  . 
they are horrible and essentially useless as they become sticky within minutes . 
your body will thank you and so will your family !  . 
i had to return them twice to eventually get an acceptable set . 
since i couldn t find one locally ,  i ordered this from amazon . 
i always still had dry flaky skin right after using this product . 
and he still has to get really close to hear it decent . 
the hole for the audiojack was way too small . 
after a lame attempt at a smooth shave ,  i tried again . 
it makes noise to for some reason is much less annoying . 
the wasabi dust gets into the nostrils and is quite irritating . 
sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads . 
try something else and save yourself a few bucks !  . 
i have been buying these lamps for num_num or num_num years . 
seriously ?  they told me i could dispose of it . 
the multiplayer mode is good for partys but even then will get lame . 
i tried reinstalling windows but it was still acting up . 
the failure rates for such a critical item  data storage  is absolutely unacceptable . 
i replaced them with something a little more durable . 
this company has not discovered how to be centered on the customer yet . 
at that point ,  windows will load its own driver . 
it fits her as well as the design allows . 
my little ferret tore it apart in no time . 
great concept and my son loved the dig aspect . 
both these jambu shoes fit my feet very well . 
i paid the shipping fee to return this useless and over priced toy . 
they had a weird flavor and after taste when i had morning sickness . 
clearly ,  this set and i weren t meant for each other . 
and the time it will take to get it back . 
i have heavily processed hair ,  undergoing removal of dye to go blonde . 
doesn t look very nice and i don t expect it to last . 
not worth the money i spent on it . 
i bought this thing assuming it would work on all capacitive screens . 
proactiv is great for some people ,  and not for others . 
one more new patch and all the issues should be resolved . 
for the second batch ,  i was extra careful . 
i was thrilled to find a num_extend bra with such great reviews . 
you have to place the film on the ulcer . 
i bought this because i want ports accessible from up on my desk . 
as the main character ,  red is just not that interesting . 
what i was doing before worked just fine . 
i purchased this after reading the positive reviews . 
this headphone proved my notion wrong . the sound quality is awfully bad . 
this item is well crafted and looks great . 
i need to pay closer attention to the reviews next time . 
can t use these in very hot situations such as frying in oil . 
i knew it was going to be a very light product . 
the label fades quickly ,  offers poor protection ,  very flimsy . 
then i increased it to double dosage ,  nothing . 
it s flimsy material that does a poor job of providing shaping . 
this is the version of mortal kombat num_num that you should definitely avoid . 
i wanted it to make our lives easier and better smelling and tidier . 
i needed a new one ,  there was a sale . 
plug is not automatically attached with international ones as attachments  . 
i had the scale for about num_num months and it worked great . 
i got this mattress because of the height . 
i bought this a while back and recently started taking it again . 
but ,  i still remember the sound and it was taller . 
from the technical description ,  these speakers fit the bill perfectly . 
the cover for the pillow was very cheap . 
it fell apart the first day i got it . 
these batteries are just so dang hard to find . 
she got confused one day and the company sent us a software update . 
it uses the same jet for both liquid and gas fuel . 
i measured it right with num_num ml of water  about an num_num oz . 
with good players you hit num_num homeruns a year . 
my beagle ate it for a few days and then refused them . 
i am moving on to a different organic cat food . 
the pockets are really small and only fit socks or sheer panty hose . 
after purchasing it ,  i decided to read the reviews on amazon . 
very cheaply constructed many of the bars were bent when received . 
but i hated this dryer the moment i turned it on . 
little did i know that it made her cheek red and swell . 
we got it unplugged quick enough before the outlet burned . 
i just returned from a trip to nyc . 
it was definately the right move for us . 
after lot of research ,  i ordered this item . 
i never heard back from them ,  with any kind of communications . 
this is the secoind phone i have tried . 
it was sealed tightly and the plastic was quite brittle . 
this bra is not the one to do that job for me . 
one of my cats ate a feather right in front of me . 
it s not perfect ,  but it works better than this !  . 
the shield went on my phone perfectly and it looked great . 
i ordered the one with the mouse tail again . 
co mon $ for a wireless adapter ,  when num_extend is built in . 
it was the worse adventure game i ve ever played . 
i had stopped taking concentrace during this time . 
and yes ,  it is an ultraviolent game ,  despite the cartoonish visuals . 
i recently purchased this headset and all i can say is  ech  . 
it was like eating a greasy turd when it came to texture . 
i have moderate acne and this did nothing for me . 
when opened ,  the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla . 
amazon should make recompense to me ,  i feel . 
it was as sour as some of those really sour candies . 
i only received $  includes shipping according to seller  credit from the seller . 
couldn t get it to work with the software package i have . 
that was the last tube of neosporin i ever used . 
each time it my hair with an odd feeling . 
lasted about num_num seconds ,  until i hit the first small bumps . 
it went completely dead  out of power  without warning . 
one swing and i hit it ,  and it broke . 
i would not recommend these chips at all . 
all lights stay on and the unit cannot be found through its configurator . 
but after i played it awhile ,  i found myself incredibly bored . 
i measured both sisters ,  and bought the large size . 
all failed ,  and the common element was this flour . 
after one month of light use ,  the left side driver stopped working . 
after opening the bottle jellied up and looked like lard . 
the rest have lasted a week or so at best . 
after christmas ,  i will see how my daughter feels . 
however this shampoo just didn t work for us . 
the extra price isn t for better quality ,  just a nicer exterior . 
i was very much looking forward to cleaning my carpets again . 
after a month it would not charge my phone anymore . 
you can scrub stains with a brush or rag . 
i had high hopes for these latex gloves based on the reviews . 
i was unimpressed by how thin it was . 
i have never liked the stench of talcum powder . 
a scenario editor also comes standard in many games these days . 
i have long toes but they are not excessively long by any means . 
bought this and placed it by where she sleeps ,  etc . 
they aren t any better than oe batteries for sure . 
i have them in zip lock in the fridge . 
i bought this mouse at my local staples store . 
it may not be corn syrup ,  but it certainly is not wholesome . 
no ,  i did not use a primer or spackle first . 
but i might consider it if i was gluten intolerant . 
it s quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin . 
i don t know which is to blame :  aveeno or amazon . 
i am going to try something else ,  maybe maca powder . 
i bought another brand at amazon previously and was very happy with them . 
besides ,  there probably are others who like it . 
however ,  i have found that this toy was not very effective . 
all i got out of the deal was hurting feet . 
they told me they had no record of my purchase . 
upset that i cant return the num_extend bottle . 
for example ,  people rent bad movies precisely because they are bad movies . 
berkeley ,  so i m not usually intimidated by technology . 
hands down the most beautiful phone with best built and num_extend
migraines are a very tricky affliction to control . 
i wish i knew this before i bought them . 
i wouldnt say this product is terrible ,  but rather cheap . 
it is not !  also fell apart after num_num uses . 
it was very tight and i just did not care for it . 
i had to keep changing the background brightness . 
this is pretty good for the headphone jack but thats about it . 
i had non stop gas and bloating around the clock . 
i purchased this camera almost num_num years ago . 
the holster fell off my dash within two days . 
you attack something equal to your level and you are dead ,  period . 
as a result ,  i would tend to not buy memorex discs again . 
do your self a favor and find a reputable dealer . 
now it is coming out every time i turn the sink on . 
the copy protection doesn t slow down your pc . 
for music and vids ,  the uniden is a no go . 
i really liked this grill cover when i got it . 
they might remove hair when you pull them off . 
hopefully ,  i save you the $ i wasted . 
the cars have no details and the environment inadequately rendered . 
they look beautiful ,  however ,  they are downright painful to wear . 
there are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic . 
all in all i bought another case and wouldn t suggest this case . 
grrrrrrrrrr ,  wish i would get my money back . 
this shampoo was also too thin and watery . 
i still have some purchased prior to num_num which is in excellent condition . 
we got these thinking our dog would enjoy some variety . 
log on to the mohaa site and check out the user forums . 
i ordered several of the different colors from this company . 
i had the original battery in num_num motorola walkies for about num_num years . 
other than that usage ,  the phone has been idle . 
be sure to combine order with other items from same company . 
don t buy this !  stick with walgreens lotion for num_num dollars instead . 
it s also not that easy to shampoo out . 
blackhawk knows this and does not make one for the newer num_extend
after about a month ,  the stitching started coming undone from the sole . 
when the bag arrived in grand rapids ,  both belts had fallen off . 
i purchased num_num of these num_num months ago . 
i would venture to say num_num sizes off . 
think of a corny scifi movie and there you have it . 
only loss is that they don t have magnets on them . 
i was tired of not knowing what s in my yogurt . 
even then they had to be readjusted often and where difficult to hear . 
it has a funny look when you take it out of the wrapper . 
this highly anticipated game is now nothing more than a joke . 
the  squeak  from the eggs is not what i imagined . 
you are either born with correct brows or you aren t ,  period . 
as long as you have other people to play with . 
my son ,  almost num_extend jumped in and played immidiately . 
i would not buy this product again if i was given a choice . 
i would never give this to someone as a gift . 
i did not purchase the wrong size according to their chart . 
i could not find shoe goo  diy  which is quick drying . 
no one over the age of num_num will be particularly impressed with this . 
they are total junk and we went back to victor . 
these underpants show up in a search for cotton . 
i could have gotten them locally this size a lot cheaper . 
but the replacement was just as bad as the first one . 
otherwise ,  it fit true to size and the colors were beautiful . 
this is the second knife i ever purchased . 
not at all what i expected after reading reviews . 
it started vibrating and shaking while i mowed . 
at all from a distance of more than two rooms . 
it does not shut off when the item being heated is removed . 
i hate when game companies force you to watch them . 
but fairy dust smells like some sweet cloying room freshener . 
i was shocked how low they sit on the hips as well . 
 i m a man and don t care how fat they are  . 
totally not worth the price on amazon either . 
smelled fishy but i can usually get past that if it tastes good . 
connection speeds were num_extend faster than with my previous num_extend router . 
i could imagine them flitting about the trees of a jungle . 
not bad overall ,  but there has to be better out there . 
i will continue my search for a better one . 
i got red bumps from it ,  so i will not use it . 
we installed this gigabit router in a corner of a num_extend sq . 
it doesn t fit that well and it feels too heavy . 
the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about . 
they definitely will not hold an actual book !  . 
the plastic holder on the handle does not always stay cool . 
i don t know which of those i will go with . 
i was too cheap though the pictures look great . 
even nokia is saying that it is not for you . 
when i opened it ,  it was obvious they were all dead . 
i can only assume that higher capacity cards won t work . 
pretty disappointing ,  because i didn t put that much force into it . 
i m going to replace it with a wireless mouse . 
 lol full duplex no way this is a half duplex modem . 
shielding is not that good ,  but good for the price i guess . 
the bag is also kind of small for the price . 
the pump worked fine as long as it was regularly cleaned . 
i have an older num_extend sony bravia num_extend lcd hdtv . 
they don t eat it even when mixed in with food . 
give it a year or so then it becomes a surprise package . 
it was hard to turn my head and i had constant headaches . 
definitely not the nicest pajama pants i ve seen . 
i don t taste the chocolate or pretzel or anything else . 
okay ,  for one thing this bear was so cute . 
they re both of mixed breeds  i rescued both of them  . 
i wear a num_extend and these shoes were a good fit . 
and i wouldn t have num_extend bored me to tears . 
if you like your hair don t buy this . 
decent texture and freshness but there is a noticeably industrial taste and aroma . 
in addition ,  the misprinted lines look bad on the final num_extend
it s basically just wood putty packaged in the form of a crayon . 
very poorly made ,  and $ for a warranty replacement . 
sometimes i even cut one in half and give it to her . 
idon t know what happened but i should have sent them back . 
it did t make a difference in my dog s thin coat . 
get the metabolic if you have a fat one . 
barely fits not very comfortable ,  loose on the belt . 
the product shipped was not the product advertised . 
this is after i ve tried to clean the container with bleach even . 
i know that sounds weird but they really did . 
my butler creek lens cover was around $
far better to get num_num or num_num cheap cases . 
if you check my reviews on amazon . com ,  i have hundreds . 
would order again from seller but not of the china glaze selection ,  . 
it is cheap and isnt very good at all . 
i like the black castor oil alot better than this . 
does this mean that i hate final fantasy ?  no . 
i now know that gpx not one of them . 
i reordered a size num_num and it fits . 
i was able to install the software after three attempts . 
war wouldn t be so bad except it s so tediously long . 
the carefree extra long liners are over an inch longer . 
you get num_num total pkgs of num_num pieces each . 
i thought it would be a harder rubberized material . 
i gave it two weeks ,  but it didn t wear in . 
i was so excited to get it after readying all the reviews . 
all these different epochs you can play in . 
usb cords just can t survive wires designed like this . 
i couldn t tell a difference after using this . 
during that time ,  his face was burning and turned red . 
you have to fight nazi s through the streets . 
ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks . 
first thing i noticed was great image quality . 
th filter plunger would stick at the top . 
i have another plantronics blue tooth headset for calls . 
this shaver worked okay for about a month . 
do yourself a fave and buy a gta game . 
to make matters more complicated ,  this doesn t happen all the time . 
i did try playing one cd and it worked fine . 
save yourself the grief and buy the amplifier . 
lack of ambition most likely held it back . 
the only thing this product elimited was my money . 
this bra is very comfortable and stays in place with no adjustments . 
the downside is the pocket that holds the cup . 
i didnt get a true taste of coffee . 
mostly she liked the colors and enjoyed picking up the fish . 
this mascara was clumpy and dried out fast ,  didn t last long . 
she told me  it is your problem  and hung up . 
the first time we used this grinder we were not impressed . 
dont buy .  . when putting it it came right off no grip . 
any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles . 
no salad spinner is perfect ,  but we can do better than this . 
the weird thing is that this problem look like it s sytem specific . 
when i got back ,  nothing on the display . 
i tried this mascara on my lashes first ,  horrible . 
my guy enjoys chasing cat toys ,  round toys ,  fuzzy mice . 
buddy if he thinks he is going to be left alone . 
it s too short and too frustrating at times . 
as of march num_extend num_num they have fallen apart and are not repairable . 
it even came with a little allen wrench to adjust the angle . 
still believe the num_extend was depleting my num_extend
this is the first golf game on the num_num and it shows . 
it doesn t seem to have the blowing power on the brookestone one . 
these bags wreak of polyurethene or whatever there are made of . 
so more than one letter will fit in more than one spot . 
nice idea ,  but the product was not good enough . 
when headphones become this uncomfortable ,  they become very noticeable . 
needless to say the toy was taken away . 
then came the horrible pixelation breakups while watching dvds . 
i ve been using this product for over a month . 
the problem was the sheer amount of heat this thing gives off . 
spend a little more money and get something better . 
again my two tank thermomenters both read num_num degrees . 
now i can t get it to work at all . 
many kernels did not pop and corn was just ok for our family . 
in that hat i think the material is cotton . 
a gentile balance of game and story line . 
you cant fill it too much or else it kinda becomes a ballon . 
we do not remove reviews because they are critical . 
i don t care too much for these razors . 
i changed out the tubing to silicone ,  still the same issue . 
i put a wrestler at num_extend and he was as tall as angle . 
i would smell better if i put on nothing at all . 
you can see doodly squat in this so called mirror . 
i just fall back to use my num_num to num_num remotes . 
it is about as natural as a plastic barbie doll . 
sorry only two stars based on the construction . 
both packs in my order the seal was broken . 
if you are a victim of too much hype . 
the quality is best of the best !  originals are also sold . 
this product has never really delivered what i expected . 
well ,  first off ,  just let me say that i am female . 
i don t like it and wish we hadn t purchased this . 
i was really shocked because she loves ,  loves ,  loves elmo . 
bought it when it came out ,  died within num_num days . 
and then it started to feel a bit itchy . 
well ,  for the price i can t complain about the quality . 
one problem :  we couldn t locate the receipt for the camera . 
i had to return this and went with the hydrofloss . 
omg !  thank goodness that i purchased two of these at once . 
purchased two and put them into my standard msft brand num_num battery charger . 
this does not live up to the hype . 
they worked for one week and then the tip came off . 
the bag was nice but just didn t last . 
but my children are very upset when it falls . 
this is the reason i don t care for vitamin water ,  either . 
i hope i can return them for a refund . 
for num_num bucks a pop though ,  it isnt so bad . 
got this as a free deluxe sample at sephora . 
this problem is exacerbated by the is device ,  when it is engaged . 
i won t risk doing business with them again . 
in that time ,  the motor is already broken . 
i wasn t worth the postage to send it back . 
the hard plastic in your ear is just to uncomfortable . 
i will be contacting the seller to try to resolve this issue !  . 
i still recommend memorex but not these with printable surfaces . 
go through several levels of phone menus to be told they re closed . 
it began ok but quickly devolved into a cra@ game . 
but after num_num years everything else is cooked . 
it is too inexpensive to waste my time returning . 
for a much better num_extend multiplayer fps ,  grab num_extend
it does not really have much coffee flavor either . 
i can now appreciate the simplicity and suitability of ordinary shoe laces . 
it s pink ,  a little chalky and not very pigmented unfortunately . 
this game is way to hard and repetitive . 
it appears you get that and the case activating linkages . 
the other music and the voice acting is horrible though . 
unfortunately ,  the binder has been made so large that it is unwieldy . 
costco has tully s for a much better price . 
should have listened to the reviews before made the purchase . 
next ,  the phone must be squeezed into a very tight armband compartment . 
even a little of this product is too much due to perfume . 
its thin wire with key rings on the end . 
i love the big sexy line of products so this was pretty disappointing . 
this is one of the only items that i have ever returned . 
i didnt like the mix of these herbs . 
please feel free to contact me if i can be of further help . 
yes ,  seido will ship a replacement for free . 
any movement at all results in a massive blur . 
and cleaning the glass jar is so much easier also . 
now ,  because of that ,  i hardly turn it on any more . 
also tried the snacks and are not any better . 
it made my hair sticky and hard i didn t like it . 
i don t know why they felt they needed to change it . 
oh well i guess i ll try something else . 
it s fun to play through one time ,  but not twice . 
if you are under num_extend maybe this game is interesting . 
this product did nothing for the bags below my eyes . 
this is the worst fm modulator i have used and owned . 
there is not even a  made in china  or  made in taiwan  label . 
as for me ,  i use each phone equally . 
they probably don t make audible ones any more . 
i m in my num_extend and have oily skin . 
not sure if it was the po or if it left that way . 
its better to pay the additional $ to buy the apple brand !  . 
i like a bit more abrasive scrubber for my skin . 
he squeaked and threw it into the air . 
i hope they make a  pyro s revenege  ,  but make it good . 
the description and other reviews lead me to believe it would . 
splinter cell is one of those games i wish i could finish . 
i would not recomend this vendor to anyone . 
this  no pressure  seat was within my budget . 
my daughter dropped it ,  and the front  page  broke off . 
aggghhh !  i can t believe my xp can t handle it . 
say you fight some of the tough enemies ,  reload . 
i just used the sample bag that came with the litter box . 
i left it laying out on the floor for several weeks . 
it s way too hard to press to activate the button . 
second like the other review says ,  the liners suck . 
it also is missing an actual menu button on the dvd player itself . 
the game is so boring ,  there is nothing unique about this game . 
the machine will fail in very short amount of time . 
now ,  it will not load a cassette anymore . 
she wanted me to take off after a couple of shots . 
you need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down . 
for the money spent this should have heavy duty wheels . 
i dont hate it ,  but i have found no difference either way . 
remember ,  the customer is supposed to go through all of . 
really .  .  . i cannot overstate how poorly this item is made . 
due to the design ,  the weight is not distributed equally . 
i bought these boots for my daughter for her birthday . 
not worth the price ,  the setup is flimsy and cheap . 
the quality of kitchenaid products has been going downhill for a long time . 
pictures also came out too dark for a camera with a flash . 
we bought this toy to keep the twins distracted during a trip . 
i immediately made a cup when i got home from the store . 
it might have helped to label the buttons . 
it might cost a little more but will be well worth it . 
ok awesome having another control !  !  !  ! now about we play . 
when i stopped using this product the majority of my issues were resolved . 
does not grind the coffee as finely as needed . 
i give this  game  a num_num out of num_extend
a lot of time searching for this specific game . 
this product didn t work for me at all . 
use it in num_num num_extend diesel ,  plenty of bouncing going on . 
i bought this from sephora before they stopped carrying fekkai products . 
i purchased this grinder after christmas of num_extend
it fit beautifully ,  and all the ports still worked ,  etc . 
the rubber didnt fit all the way in the plastic . 
all of the harney s teas taste artificial to me . 
the upside is that i had no problem returning it and refunded promptly . 
i threw it  the sh  out and will not buy again . 
some of the other brands i tried were even worse . 
my butane gas fuel lighters work much longer . 
they are cute though ,  so i will use them at home . 
if you re never moving the cable then sure ,  it s fine . 
great concept ,  yet it was tourn apart by the terrible programming . 
okay ,  to be fair ,  we re talking about a serving here . 
like someone else mentioned i used it num_num times and threw it away . 
it said it would work on darker brown and highlighted hair . 
it took a little finesse to get it nice and sturdy . 
ugh ,  i can feel my heartburn forming even now . 
product no better than cheapos that come with cheap num_extend players . 
i like to enjoy a good dark french roast at night . 
the product works so far ,  but it s pretty much obsolete now . 
luggage very nice and good quality ,  but did notinclude a large piece . 
they tried to make it like a grand theft auto with more gore . 
even after machine washing it ,  the smell would come back right away . 
so i cant say it isnt worth the money . 
changed the ingredients from fish meal to turkey meal . 
these are incredibly flimsy and show knife marks immediately . 
i purchased this to network my wife s lenovo laptop and my macbook . 
this filter is a sorry replacement for the original . 
and if the code on the unit starts with an  r  . 
i know better than to buy playtex bra s . 
my neghibor is in num_extend grade and he beat it in one night . 
i didn t have any issues with the back . 
coat with some nice plastic varnish looking stuff and there you have it . 
i am an avid farm of walden farms products . 
and it really is huge and horribly stinky . 
you can only play in num_extend or above which is a downside also . 
the flickering would stop if i pressed on it . 
several of these telescopes were broken when the package arrived . 
this is a good example of the sad deterioration in overall ka quality . 
which are made every more poorly than unapproved num_extend party accessories . 
i assume it had lost the connection and then reconnected . 
when one comes down with something possibly contagious ,  all go on antibiotics . 
if you have a dog that is rough on toys pass this up . 
remove the tray and toss the soiled litter into a container . 
they have a nice fit ,  cut loose and the material seems strong . 
needless to say ,  i got very frustrated and threw these away . 
overly artificial ,  smells and tastes like a scented soap bar . 
this unit was not mistreated and was used very lightly in that time . 
speaking of graphics this game is total eye candy . 
i definitely would not recommend any of the total effects brands . 
and now with the first patch , the sound is all screwed up . 
that come with skin exposure to the sun . 
not sure about an xt since it is smaller . 
this was the follow up to the original movie . 
i have always used cateye but this one sucks . 
so my scalp was irritated right after using this . 
the dock works ,  but it does not really provide any benefits . 
i have played a million games like that ,  that are much better . 
the two things on the side that hold the phone on . 
not as thick of a denim as they used to be i think . 
i thought these would be much more flexible than they are . 
there are invisible walls set up to keep you trapped like a rat . 
even num_num drops seemed like less than a serving to me . 
if i had known ,  i wouldn t have ordered . 
i didn t expect a very durable tube for the price . 
it also goes so in dept it is dumb . 
the weld just totally gave out and the two halves separated for good . 
my son did a few suggestions from the cards . 
not a good business practice to fail to disclose ingredients . 
for the most part ,  she was satisfied with it . 
web configuration is a mess and very slow . 
i purchased this to wear for postpartum support . 
the luxmo ac travel wall charger is num_extend not num_extend as listed . 
the other two cookies had one ,  yes one ,  chocolate chip . 
it is worse than the things i was hoping to replace . 
much better than the num_num jabras and motorola bluetooths i had before . 
the salt was higher ,  to my palate ,  then others . 
i cant see why people call halo the greatest fps of all time . 
it is a small investment so take the risk if you want . 
so when my strings wear out ,  i got this . 
none of the pictures go over the num_extend lb rating . 
i will try the num_extend since it has great reviews . 
don t make the same mistake like my mother . 
i m returning it to the store i purchased from . 
the tray has already warped after the first use . 
the biggest problem is my cat is avoiding it . 
i don t have any severe allergies but some flowers make me sneeze . 
still the overly sticky green tab in the corner . 
if you have one avoid this card like the plague . 
first off ,  it takes up like num_extend of hard drive space . 
still the aftertaste was really off putting despite what it says . 
looks like it was made in the num_extend and made cheaply as well . 
she taps the orange bug and that one pops up . 
at least that doesn t hit the wallet so hard . 
do not but this unless you enjoy buying junk . 
i m a glutton for punishment ,  i bought num_num of these . 
as a stand alone product ,  get real peanut butter . 
i bought this to help while building my desktop computer . 
first ,  it is much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds . 
i am not even going to use it for recording . 
and it makes it worth a bad num_extend goes on whiteish . 
that one works and leaves your hands free . 
after a long time i get out another thermometer and my tmp was num_extend
these items should be included in a childs tent kit . 
these wireless headphones are darn near the  junk  cateogry . 
hopefully this will be a lesson learned for thq . 
but that s one of three main problems with this game . 
i am sure this is a good product for some . 
while trying ,  my thumb released the trigger and the ring flew off . 
it smelled like medicinal maple syrup ,  but not in a bad way . 
get actual quality parts ,  not cheap knockoff imitations . 
it is now october and my vacuum died this week . 
for the price ,  i think there are better options on the market . 
it has been silent ,  and so has virgin mobile . the only num_extend
the cover that came is a solid light purple . 
it is a much better case in both looks and protection . 
i much prefer suave advanced therapy  walmart ,  $
however ,  ancient harvest doesn t do a very good job . 
i returned this because it is too oilly ,  and too thick . 
returned it and bought an msr alpine pot . 
hotimport toys would not do anything for me . 
these soles on these rockies still look new ,  just separating . 
but the one to day give me better benifits . 
but the lucky earth product only cleans stuff slightly better than water . 
there is little support on the sides and wasn t perfectly flat . 
i do have fine hair should that be the difference . 
this one did not say that ,  and disuade me from buying it . 
thus ,  i know i am at about max capacity . 
i m mixed and have hair like jennifer freeman or mya . 
there is some person on youtube showing how to use this . 
there is absolutely no change with my fine lines . 
suggest a wok with a companion ring instead . 
i end up throwing away unused powder on that tissue . 
they have it num_extend too much loading ,  especially in multiplayer session stuff . 
it s huge ,  so i will give it that . 
the sprouted area on many of the seeds had black mold . 
on the positive side the color white is nice for our kitchen . 
you will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken . 
do not buy unless you want to crack your phone . 
the waist band fell apart the first time they were washed . 
apparently ,  valve has found it s niche with the later . 
trying not to break it as i worked it down . 
i order screen protectors for my evo num_extend every few months . 
it was well constructed ,  and the lace was quite pretty . 
it was too small and does not fit well . 
it was so dry that i almost choked on it . white chocolate . 
my small num_num year old can t even get it to go around . 
they arent that great of quality to need separate adhesive . 
connect a button switch to the two wires . 
i thought this would be a good product . 
for others once or several times a day . 
lots of fat drains out of the meat !   . 
this product needs an off button ,  it is so annoying . 
my next gripe with this game are the weapons . 
i think we ll stick with the kong chew toys though . 
i did not realize that there were hard and soft jolly balls . 
and i dont even want to start about the controls . 
this shipment however ,  smells awful like some kind of diluted cleaner . 
i ll just stick to a seat belted harness for her . 
it is a little grainy ,  the flavor is a bit off . 
my hands do not get hot in these gloves . 
we generally walk five or six miles a day . 
i do not recommend this for a giant breed . 
i really hate it when i buy something this inferior . 
very likely a bad capacitor in the internal power supply . 
hopefully it will work out a little better . 
i have the red blinking light syndrome also . 
when your product requires your customer to use a special case . 
one of my nostrils is almost always completely obstructed . 
but having played it ,  it is so much more fun than num_extend
my unit won t allow me to switch to miles . 
also ,  the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time . 
envisioned a powerful hate letter addressed to hasbro . 
i think that it needs upgrading by the manufactor . 
i have the num_num lb cobra crossbow pistol ,  which is great . 
but due to small desk space ,  i wanted to try trackball devices . 
probably best to just go for the battery powered version . 
ubisoft is not a developer ,  they are a publisher . 
there are also a good amount of interesting missions . 
and it is very hard to keep them all in their intended places . 
on the other two it was about num_extend or so ,  acceptable . 
maybe it will work on striplashes but it wont work for extension lashes . 
because this was frustrating rather than fun i give it a num_num star . 
from roots to tips ,  it was squeaky and felt raw . 
don t waste your money on this phony elixir . 
this resolves almost all of the problems ,  but at a cost . 
i thought for sure ,  these would be keepers . 
it s a basic application ,  and shouldn t ever crash . 
i have other similiar brands that met the standards i expected . 
anyways ,  my dogs had zero interest in it . 
i m allergic to scents like lavender and lilac . 
but for the price you cant beat it . 
usually id score bates as num_num stars but just cant this time . 
we have used it for spices ,  meats and letters . 
it tastes like a really bad protein bar . 
package marked for num_num vue but item did not work . 
also picks up the lint in your pocket something fierce . 
i have owned the original calphalon professional hard anodized for near num_num years . 
i can t even justify these for the price . 
it feels like the game is made for a little kid . 
great performance but only for a short time . 
he spoke to me as though i was a blithering idiot . 
they ultimately told me they thought that the card was bad . 
the graphics are pretty awesome ,  but there s not much game here . 
i recently tried the ponds clean sweep wet cleansing towelettes . 
another in a continuing saga of deficient bluetooth headsets . 
i read about polarizing filters and i became interested in trying one out . 
this memory card that i just bought does not even work . 
anyway i set this game at what i usually have games set at . 
that was a poor choice on my part . 
i bought my first set of these in june ,  num_num for $
the plug still works for other usb devices but the cord is worthless . 
did not make it look like paint was wet i personaly use magualers . 
these sorry excuses for wireless headphones fail on all counts . 
this game is not as good as everyone claims it is . 
did not come in a squeeze tube but a glass jar . 
there are a lot of dragonflies to find ,  mini games to play . 
this happens with both the panasonic and the braun . 
i should have read the other reviews before i purchased these pads . 
no ,  i didn t use it drive nails or cut rebar . 
i think i must be sensitive to these sugar substitutes . 
now the mirror doesn t hold water at all and is completely useless . 
i will also be sending this one back . 
also ,  plastic packaging on mine wasn t sealed on some . 
raiden num_num lacked the suspense and the awesome feel of things blowing up . 
based on other reviews i snapped these up with high hopes . 
the crosspin will not correctly fit this weapon . 
i have relaxed hair and i will not be purchasing this product again . 
they have all these special charts and photos . 
we enjoy a cup of coffee with bailey s irish cream . 
you press the button and  pretend .   that s it . 
these shoes are a big disappointment ,  and more money down the drain . 
would have been better if it stayed on . 
anyway the control is terrible with the gamepad . 
it was solid as a rock  this one is not  . 
it isn t super potent but its definitely there . 
i wish i could recommend this tent but i cannot . 
i ordered an xl pair of these gloves . 
when i just did the setup manually it worked fine . 
sony refused to honor warranty and wanted $ to fix it . 
this shoe was so tight i couldn t put it on . 
the worst part about this knife is definitely the blade . 
you pay for what you get when it come to this product . 
i knew something was wrong when i picked up the box . 
this set on the teething ring is much larger than the puppy . 
the same goes where choosing a custom backdrop for the scenes . 
unfortunately ,  it also has a habit of clinging .  . to everything . 
advertised as a triple wide and were more narrow than the average slipper . 
the scratchy part on the back i really do not like . 
i have it for num_num months already and it still smell . 
would not stand upright and fell repeatedly and put hole in wall . 
it s a crap shoot as to what quality you get . 
do yourself a favor and search for the original battlezone . 
left in num_num min with a cap ,  massaged my hair and rinsed . 
description clearly stated composite toe ,  so hopefully somebody changes this . 
i bought one before and it was amazing . 
this suits a manly woman or a gay man . 
they re okay ,  but the clips do fall off with minimal use . 
it does not hold the wires very tight . 
it s like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . 
this was a perfume i had to wash off . 
i felt like i was scratching my phone with the hard aluminum case . 
if you don t hold them at the perfect angle no ink comes num_extend
the bottom line for me is that it does not work . 
liked the idea but it didn t really work very well . 
i owned wellness clinics for over num_num decades . 
i used it just one day a week at our satellite office . 
the gunz feel like you are shooting a bb gun . 
for the price i really expecte it to be . 
i chucked this sucker and got seperate timer . 
the most flexible mascara wand i ve ever used . 
this is crazy !  this is an rpg we re playing here . 
i find myself struggling to maneuver the razor across my face . 
interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough . 
it just made my hair have pointy ,  stiff spikes at the ends . 
i bought this for my daughter to use with my first grandchild . 
i then provided him with the model and serial number of my mouse . 
i purchased this product at my local pet store . 
there are also secret missions which are nearly impossible to do . 
doesn t have much of a scent and feels rather slimy . 
purhaps it was the size or the dose . 
it has the  old evil is coming  theme . 
i usually never write reviews ,  although i love to read them . 
it felt uncomfortable to wear for the required num_num minutes . 
after taking this vitamin ,  my blood pressure went way up . 
oh well my quest gones on for a good reliable coffee maker . 
i could not clean or fix up this one with any luck . 
then i notice a strange quirk about the targetting icon . 
i ll update this review if there is any change . 
you have to get good cuticle nippers and a good cuticle remover gel . 
i have spanish tile and the  dust bunnies  were rampant . 
but with my luck ,  i don t think i should risk again . 
i got this for my first aid kit . 
i would absolutely not recommend them for a dog with coarse hair . 
what is going on here ?  i pondered to myself . 
this particular crock pot for sale here is not that way at all . 
i guarantee this one will not last that long . 
it would be good if you had say chapped cheeks . 
then it was a little too late for him to love it . 
it has not fade the stretch marks either . 
one nice thing i will say about the num_extend
i saw absolutley no results when i used this product . 
this may indicate that the cabinet file is corrupt . 
only unique nutritious ingredient is cinnamon and they give hardly any satiety . 
this horrible scratching post has a life of it s own . 
the packaging looks the same as this ,  but it is not . 
went for cheap and bought a repurposed unit . 
this toy poses a hazard as currently designed . 
maybe others will have better results ,  but not me . 
the other battery keeps a great charge on the other samsung phone . 
you really have no other choice at this point but be aware . 
we have the old version of this phone . 
they felt uncomfortable and did not look like real hair . 
the form factor of this grinder is very nice . 
it is broken at num_extend day of use and does not stand phone . 
i have tried to contact the company without success . 
the first dog i tried this on was my smaller pup . 
mine arrived with no way to turn it on . 
so ,  if time is a factor ,  go with vz assurion . 
and it unscrews from the base even after short blends . 
here is where you ll spend your time in the game . 
anyone looking for those wordings should avoid num_extend
get a scope or stick to the sight that s on the rifle . 
could give higher rating if not for that fact . 
i bought this unit a couple of years ago . 
looked like a good product ,  seemed well made . 
but it shouldn t have broken in the first place . 
the door comes off and goes back on without a problem . 
i bought it based on the reviews ,  which were so positive . 
i love bows ,  this was a great case . 
one of the kids noticed it about halfway through the box . 
it s just that it doesn t really back up its claims . 
i love the other fragrances and the quality of the caldrea products . 
the battery blew up on connecting to my apc ups . 
i get better reception with the wired antenna packaged with my receivers . 
in fact ,  it s worse than mechwarrior num_num or num_extend
i have no problem spending money on a quality product . 
i have a wonderful cat who has a single flaw . 
worked like a champ for about num_num hours . 
men of valor makes my top num_num worst fps games of all time . 
almost reminds me of sewer shark for sega cd . 
they don t even explain how to charge the device using solar . 
in fe ,  it s pretty much battle after battle . 
the buttons on the console itself are few . 
this allowed me to skip the red ring and go right to orange . 
i think i am just a little too rough for it . 
my cat tracks this stuff all over the house . 
it completely died with one week left of warranty . 
i do not know if my kids will like . 
the top of the shoes actually bruised the top of my feet . 
probably will avoid these  rapid  whitening kits moving forward  :   . 
it ,  actually ,  gags me when i put it in their boxes . 
the computer on some missions has as many as num_num bases . 
it doesn t matter if you set it for num_extend or num_num hours . 
and the worst thing was it wasn t effective stimulus no more . 
i contacted leapfrog and they sent a replacement . 
as said before .  .  . all hdmi cables are the same . 
the legs on this target are extremely short and blunt tipped . 
first ,  i had the worst time mixing this product . 
it barely fits a bike without any accessories . 
i liked the sneaker ,  and the way that they were made . 
i thought i would give it a try . 
why can t there be both genders in each book ?  . 
i purchased this as an addition for my num_extend equipment . 
the box is very flimsy so it flexes when you roll it . 
ended up tossing the rest of the box . 
if the bought together batteries are incorrect ,  i will be very angry . 
and ,  ironically ,  the sound was the primary problem . 
i love my kats but not that much . 
just mute the volume on your tv to make life easier for yourself . 
don t make the same mistake like i did . 
i tried them on and it was immediate relief . 
i got this for my daughter for christmas based on all the reviews . 
check the other reviewers of the  customers  who liked this product . 
i feel like i don t have full control of this cane . 
the cord doesn t stay in my samsung phone . 
i am hoping this thing last for years to come . 
i put the feeder in on a thursday evening . 
amazon should not offer this and degrade themselves . 
i had been looking everywhere for these color and style silly bandz . 
best of all ,  don t buy it in the first place . 
we suspected the possibility of a knockoff or imposter . 
i can t tolerate the capsules  muss and side effects . 
the second laser worked really well for about num_num months . 
i d be stunned if it held up any time at all . 
something that has been num_extend start out of num_extend
i m considering giving it to my brother because we never use it . 
i soak a cotton ball and wrap it in foil . 
it did not provide volume like the other products i tried . 
all you do is fight and then fight and then fight some more . 
one day this tech will actually take off . 
for what an item that is well under num_num bucks . 
but now the second set stopped in the same manner . 
my mixer is just under a year old . 
without any need for any meds for any chronic condition . 
you really have to scrape to get the stuff off . 
then i began to feel and look bloated continuously . 
we bought two of these based on reviews . 
it didn t even touch the stains and left a residue . 
according to the reviews ,  this phone fit the bill perfectly . 
i would not recommend this to anyone ,  and i did return it . 
it looked , felt and had the consistancy of hair conditioner . 
my rabbits tips this bowl right over and water goes everywhere . 
i have really sensitive skin and it was not working for me . 
i used superglue to hold it together ,  which worked reasonably well . 
then ,  after num_num more shots ,  the over exposure would occur again . 
it fit fine and it is good enough for basic calls at home . 
there weren t enough of the large red ones to make forts . 
a bit disconcerting and unsatisfactory in $ product . 
maybe that will work for you but i won t buy them again . 
but it made the water get yucky quicker than usual . 
every samsung oem cable is not the same . 
i re sold one an my roommate used the other . 
powder is so light it comes through everywhere . 
these were replacements for a pair of koss headphones that broke . 
this is the second invicta watch i purchased that was defective . 
but .  . this product did not live up to the hype . 
still have no body ,  and curls were not enhanced . 
as a frequent coffee drinker ,  i ve got the usual caffeine stains . 
my cat couldn t stand this for some reason . 
is too thick ,  and doesnt mix well with water . 
 my hands are of average size for a male  . 
first time i used it i noticed audio dropping out . 
this one looked to be in mint condition . 
don t know why this is but that s the way it is . 
since he thinks he is the king of neat and organized . 
the ol  switcheroo  series num_extend  japanese :  gold num_extend
i ve sent back two of these and both have failed . 
i expected more from this brand even after reading previous reviews . 
too bad i never got this one that i bought . 
absolutely demolishes your tastebuds for quite some time . 
my mother wanted a simple summer cut and wanted to borrow my flowbee . 
when the cable connector goes bad ,  the charger becomes useless . 
it would not fit in my car and allow my dog to move . 
i don t have any shrinkage or cuticle lifting . 
this product didn t attract the ants very well compared to other products . 
once you brush try running your fingers through your hair . 
shipping was about average ,  got there in about a week . 
once you beat him ,  you can use this weapon for yourself . 
it s hard to enjoy a game when it crashes that often . 
saying that ,  maybe i should have stopped there . 
it actually leaves a yellow stain on my hands and clothes . 
i wore these twice and they skinned the . 
this new formula includes a wide spectrum sunscreen . 
once you pull your hand away ,  no frequency what so ever . 
not sure how it got previous nice reviews . 
the dress is very itchy ,  very hot ,  very uncomfortable . 
the liquid flow kept getting slower and slower . 
i unfortunately ordered a case and don t know what i was thinking . 
there is no other real interaction beyond that . 
num_num lame moves ,  and all the bad guys look the same . 
when you get it ,  it is hard plastic . it sucks . 
the lower strap also rolls up and constantly need adjusting . 
ordered toms in a different fabric instead and glad i did . 
these tabs drop to the tank bottom and stay there intact . 
these patches only work if you use rubber cement to hold them on . 
great .  .  . i feel like this is a bad joke . 
i didn t notice any difference in my baby when using this product . 
i am comparing these to the trader joes seaweed snacks . 
the correct filter for the dustbuster num_extend is replacement filter num_extend
just like someone wrote below ,  this seemed to clarify my hair . 
it is too small for the samsung s ii . 
good thing i know how to kentucky wind my rifle . 
it starts to charge then after a few seconds stops . 
overall i will never buy from new harbor ever again . 
wargods is a much better game made by the same people for the num_extend
there again developers are getting lazy and lazyer by the moment . 
looks like it will last a long time . 
of course i didn t really give it a try . 
it is easy and short !  you also can t save the game . 
i have two huge air stones moving water and a spray bar . 
given enough time ,  many people could pass this game . 
but you ll have to excuse me i guess . 
the fabric used on the back is itchy . 
howdy y all , the actual item does it s job well . 
grinding cheese ?  that s what they make cheese graters for . 
more fingerprints show up on this thing than touching an ipad . 
i have very thick num_extend num_extend curly hair . 
$ for rusty staples and glue !  no thank you . 
thankfully ,  my dog is very particular about what she swallows . 
pay the num_num or num_num bucks and get the original . 
annoyed that i was misled but still love the game . 
it feels like the headache from when i took wellbutrin . 
it did leave my hair with lots of body but no shine . 
on top of that your guns are atrocious in aiming . 
for some odd reason ,  urine was leaking onto the floor . 
may still be a good product for some people . 
 i have very soft waves in the back . 
i have no real use for this one . 
it s like they tried to jazz it up way too much . 
i bought roller shower rings previously from amazon and loved them . 
as a result ,  you have ,  in essence ,  a failed product . 
not anywhere as near useful as i d hoped . 
i was overall quite happy with this mount . 
this case looks good ,  but that s about it . 
this cube is straight ,  so gravity pulls the pegs right out . 
i ordered this item so my granddaughter could easily change her smaller aquarium . 
i see other reviewers have also had this part break . 
but looking at the other negative reviews here i m feeling less generous . 
and for the horrible taste ,  there is zero relief . 
i am using the num_extend one in num_num weeks . 
in short this pad is not worth the money or trouble . 
there s no question the silicone case must offer better shock resistance . 
however this bag seemed a little discolored and the aroma was different . 
i will cancell before my num_num days will run out . 
this thing is humongous !  it takes up too much space . 
it has left a bitter taste in my mouth . 
i don t know why they just don t give it a try . 
when i added this to their room ,  they actually slept all night . 
when my umbrella arrived ,  unfortunately it was significantly damaged and unrepairable . 
but it didn t work out for my num_extend
but everyone is always raving about their dye so i gave in . 
even when said game is an unbalanced nightmare with a crap plot . 
the industry standard is to list  milliamp hours  . 
there is not weight to the pieces so it just feels cheap . 
i never wanted tails to be some infomaniac like ali baba . 
just passing along a hint for fellow sufferers . 
when we went by the directions ,  it was boring . 
i wish i can give this a num_num star . 
i was almost to the point of yawning . 
i monitor use ,  and only use it for special rewards . 
moreover ,  they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking . 
these are not new drives and not worth the time . 
it worked ok on schraeder side ,  but presta side was not num_extend
she was able to fit the entire ball in her mouth . 
everybody that i know that has a palm ,  bought an additional case . 
some $ skull candy earbuds have way better sound quality . 
however ,  it s quite disappointing when you try to use it . 
and while they told me how much my business means to them . 
i will stick with the trusty voyager num_extend
this game is alright but it has many flaws . 
i ordered size num_extend in storm blue for my daughter . 
in this case is two pieces of think soft foam . 
not happy about the center stone at all . 
this game does not ,  in fact ,  star superman . 
my pit mix chewed this up in a week . 
i went through num_num of them over a num_num month period . 
if you squeeze the grip you ll separate the halves . 
there s a  clumsiness  level built in that might be . 
this cocoa is very weak in taste and texture . 
these are soft and have ridges that would aid in the teething process . 
seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package . 
and it was less than ten dollars for num_num oz . 
but i have been gamming for a very long time . 
i ll stick with my kashi berry lemonade chewy granola bars instead . 
the genuine item provides a reasonably well regulated num_num volts . 
just got really boring without  quick save  option . 
the thin food is really hard to feed because it runs everywhere . 
this set is way smaller than what i expected . 
it needs heroes and revolutionaries ,  pirates and brigands ,  disasters and surprises . 
the resolution it s terrible ,  a child can make them much better . 
my plan was test it out and buy num_num if it worked . 
your ship bounces off of planets like nerf balls . 
num_num star for sturdy product and another star for concept . 
do not buy the num_num period imo !  waste of money !  . 
set up the product and it worked pretty well at first . 
so i laid out another $ or so . 
you can stand num_num degrees from the monitor and still see the screen . 
this radio gives a ten dollar sound for ten bucks . 
where i live ,  radio stations use every single available frequency . 
once again ,  i should have just listened to the prior reviewers . 
a new expansion was about to come out . 
i already purchased a little more expensive higher quality one . 
it did a great job cooling off my thinkpad num_extend
this seems like really good marketing and very little substance . 
the telescopic arm wobbles ,  and feels like will break any second . 
these invicta watches are all flash and no substance . 
i got it as a backup card for my nikon num_extend digital camera . 
maybe half the thickness of a standard face cloth . 
i could barely pump out my reps ,  even with lighter weight . 
they are relatively inflexible and  hard  as well as somewhat heavy . 
maybe my whiteheads are too small or not formed enough . 
the manufacturer replaced it at no charge with a second unit . 
to put it bluntly ,  they re just too greasy and chewy . 
my cat was on the bed when it fell off the wall . 
not a very nice cover ,  meaning not soft nor comfortable . 
i just hope it smells better as time goes on . 
i bought three of them and felt a little jipped . 
this is the second watch of this particular model i bought . 
after about num_num months the power button dissapeared inside the camera . 
i tried to use some moleskin to help ,  but no luck . 
we have been struggling to find the canned fish and sweet potato recipe . 
overall ,  i am very disappointed with the quality of my unit . 
i was really hoping to like this product . 
not that bad a thing ,  except they botched the sound mix . 
i used this product for about num_num months . 
i can t see any difference at all when i use this . 
i think it may be the powder coating that s to blame . 
forget it !  it won t stay in my ear . 
i bought this phone for use by a visually impaired person . 
be safe on the road ,  stay away from this item . 
definitely would not be able to start a fire . 
after the first one failed i should have stopped . 
it is the third or fourth ingredient i believe . 
we used this num_extend grinder for num_num years for spices only . 
second pot same thing . so i left it all for another day . 
i purchased this product and it arrived empty . 
so i decided to test drive this product . 
a waste of time on so many ,  many levels . 
it s a sound puzzle but there was no sound . 
pretty ,  but the arch fit my foot all wrong . 
you can set the aromasticks out in the open . 
i had bought the attachments when i got my first wand . 
one day it just stopped working and would not even power on . 
otherwise ,  it is so cumbersome with very little going on . 
i believe the manufacturer needs to make the attachments stronger with brass attachments . 
the sound is not that great and certainly not accurate . 
the weapons stop working when their durability is all used up . 
now i have a num_num gallon and learned a few things about filtration . 
i had read reviews about some of them not working . 
if you call them ,  they will replace defective hardware well enough . 
i have other company whey that taste better . 
it looks like the liner folded over and cut into the tube . 
the cable won t even fit into the vita correctly . 
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps . 
the cups began to separate from the frame not long after first use . 
the next one worked for three or four days ,  then it died . 
num_extend x num_extend cm one triangular bandage ,  num_num in . 
done . technical stuff about the ratcheting mechanism : regarding the ratcheting mechanism . 
this makes the resulting spray worse and a waste . 
i received this as a gift over one year ago . 
he is very smart and loves puzzles and interactive toys . 
these are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke . 
you have to just run the play as is . 
but i know other netgear products have been good but not this one . 
the taste is awesome and tastes nothing like vitamins . 
went back to using trader joe olive oil spray . 
never order cosmetics online unless you ve tried them elsewhere first . 
the lights on the machine don t light up num_extend
hope this helps save some people the cost of return shipping . 
i ve had to send the pot through its clean cycle now . 
i have trouble finding the right products for my skin . 
i got this assembly and immediately was very pleased with it . 
the effect was rather like trying to look through a pair of tubes . 
there was nothing wrong with the cover only i got the incorrect cover . 
however the first time i dropped it on my bathroom floor it broke . 
this is the first vanity fair slip that has disappointed me . 
would not take the chance on this brand again . 
this game will take you about num_num months to beat . 
all the pictures in the book look the same . 
i finally found that the monoprice power center worked ,  though . 
i ll be sharing this with folks for many months . 
i tried this after reading all the fabulous reviews on here . 
even wind didn t seem to bother the headset much . 
i gave it two stars because it is well made . 
seems a bit odd of a response from them . 
my biggest gripe is that the game offers no options . 
it is now in a box not being used . 
i wish it had the same finish as the other pans . 
please be sure to check the dimensions of the product before ordering it . 
i have read the manual and tried numerous settings with no change . 
i have had multiple failures of various kinds . 
the good thing is they don t count towards your population . 
his died by failing to power up despite the choice of power source . 
now that smells good and it stays on your dog !  . 
my knives started to rust after num_extend of use . 
this is an instant powder that you mix with hot water . 
this shirt looks good ,  however i haven t even worn it yet . 
you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot . 
it does not fit well to the cage . 
and the oily part was well just oily and had no flavor . 
i am not sure if their little boy enjoyed it either . 
i expected a longer lasting piece of electronics from a japanese company . 
limitations are only how much space is available on your hard drive . 
my feelings for the swiss ,  however ,  are improved . 
however ,  don t count on it as a functional watch at all . 
i m not the  cutesy  type at age num_extend
i broke out in hives ,  but knew immediately what it was . 
this truly is about the worst product i have ever purchased . 
i attempted to play this game right after playing syberia ii . 
to me that is very boring and just lazy on blizzard s part . 
i was sad to have to send it back . 
seems to be good quality but is a long time to receive . 
always had to refill and wait to make a full pot of coffee . 
there are no numbers on it and it doesn t ring you back . 
frankly ,  i thought circle of the moon was better . 
the sound was surprisingly good ,  actually better than my inexpensive wired pair . 
after playing the excellent half life num_num and it s sequel episode one . 
this is the new replacement for sony  venerable num_extend
i would not recommend purchasing this toy for your kids . 
therefore i created my own perfect solution . you will num_extend
i bought this for my iphone num_num and ipod touch num_extend generation . 
i got a new headset the first time on warranty . 
needed to try something ,  but just didn t take care of it . 
they worked until i found a set that fit properly . 
looks terrible ,  and it didn t fit the phone properly . 
it looks like the refined coconut oil not extra virgin . 
so that was great news and a relief . 
i ll probably not use the rest of teh box . 
work better as cake and cupcake toppers than anything else . 
there definitely was that piney flavor that permeated the soup . 
and once you ve heard about whether or not the patch works . 
i find the protector is very prone to finger oils gathering though . 
my dogs put holes in it in less than num_num minutes . 
i used totally three times ,  now it is in my trash can . 
this is another case of you get what you pay for . 
i rarely use my phone during the day while i m at work . 
not really impressed by it s production company either  rare  . 
only buy this for dogs with puppy teeth . 
looks as if it was cut with scissors . 
i have absolutely nothing against these countries politically or otherwise . 
i ordered this yogi green tea after trying num_num of their chai teas . 
i purchased them from peeled fruit ,  not amazon . 
mine broke just by taking my phone out of it . 
i don t know . i will be getting them another fountain . 
the cables i received are not the ones i ordered in the picture . 
water gets trapped under the outer plastic bezel when you wash the pitcher . 
also grabber just isn t wide enough to pick up very much . 
we used to get grant s ant baits and they worked great . 
i got these googles to protect his eyes from the wind and debris . 
well it s a lot bigger then we had hoped for . 
makes me wonder if these were really samsung or a fake . 
it was off and on as far a working on sunday . 
the posts are not the typical size one might find in us stores . 
num_extend the day after  santa  gave it to her . 
the ball on my num_num year old logitech feels better . 
i believe this would be much better on medium to darker skin tones . 
wrong !  the rod fell right out of the handle . 
the whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy . 
i guess the saying goes  ,  you get what you pay for . 
this combination of crosman rifle and bbs should be avoided . 
halfway back ,  you get a prompt saying someone turned the switch off . 
it is difficult to find and press the buttons . 
he barely plays with the castle at all honestly . 
there s a num_num star level of how wanted you are . 
i unfortunately had to purchase three from a different brand and seller . 
also ,  it is not soft so he did not cuddle with it . 
but it s okay for a try i wouldn t buy it . 
that is not the way you are supposed to use it . 
i don t think this thing worked at all . 
the blower is serioudly underpowered compared to the $ weedeater model i have . 
it ought to put him  or her  in their place . 
i never run my system with admin access unless installing software . 
it lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly . 
i started this product based on dr oz .  s tv show recommendation . 
you will hear hissing at low volumes during movies or tv shows . 
i opened up the package and it was super dirty on the inside . 
i hate to return the product because it was so uncomfortable . 
i doubt the shirt is made from num_num ounce cotton as advertised . 
thinkthin uses sugar alcohol instead of conventional sugar . 
they need better quality paper and better artists who actually have talent . 
i also like that it has a cross base bars . 
skip this game and get wii sports resort instead . 
didn t work for my dog for his separation anxiety . 
i called the company ,  but they were closed . 
the justrite cans are also far easier to transport and fill . 
the length was actually good in the one size bigger . 
don t pay attention to this review and destroy your mosin . 
if you think pokemon is cool ,  you ll probably like this game . 
like the clarins tinted tanner for legs ,  for example . soooo disappointed . 
you could make a better stand with cardboard and masking tape . 
the game has fairly good cartoonish graphics for the time it was made . 
stainless stell yellow gold actually looks just like brass in real life . 
it should have taken num_num minutes ,  instead it took num_extend
a month later ,  not even restarting the switches would help . 
 we saw smaller and smaller litters as we gave higher doses . 
if you must play it ,  rent it ,  absolutely don t buy . 
but it is very very painful for standing . 
that should be the new name of this series . 
deformed graphics ,  waaay too much talking thattakes forever ,  no real action . 
it only is leakproof ,  in the extended outside position . 
you are getting speeds litter better than usb num_extend
could have been good but it crashes too often . 
the spinner that is attached to the base is a very poor idea . 
why the hype ?  my one year old rarely picks this up . 
i had to discontinue use and bought another . 
these sound like they would be so good . 
i have been a pretty standard num_extend for many years . 
wish it could be returned but no such luck . 
both cables are very short and barely reach anywhere . 
also the top  removeable  part is extrememly flimsy and cheap feeling . 
as an engineer ,  i think it s a design flaw . 
after i stopped applying the sunscreen ,  i noticed that it went away . 
either that or it was made in china . 
my first set developed a buzz after several weeks . 
it doesn t give a seamless constant charge as implied . 
and after about a month ,  it began to skip . 
is there a good one out there somewhere ?  . 
so maybe with level expectations ,  it can still be good . 
i do recommend most others by knorr ,  but not this one . 
this coffee seemed to fit the bill so i ordered it . 
this is a very strong tasting and drying kind of mouth wash . 
thet should better state the declanation is permanently fixed ,  not adjustable . 
the second one is like the first one . 
air pressure does not keep num_extend in the liquid . 
i gave this one star because you have to give at least one . 
loved the fact that it is natural just wish it actually worked . 
every battle i have played has been won by the germans . 
i am putting it with my non working bushnell num_extend weather monitor . 
it reminded me of old mint jelly beans ,  or chinese herbal tonics . 
do you really need to be able to research alliances ?  good and num_extend
i ve never had that happendoes not shape at all . 
there sway too much cinnamon and very littlevanilla taste . 
the color is green and not very appealing to look at . 
moving on ,  i m online today to order the weleda rose . 
they say affirimitive num_num times before doing something . 
i was on the phone and the pup felt ignored . 
i didn t like it since i opened the package . 
there isn t even any equipment besides the badges you periodically get . 
for almost num_num bucks ,  that was not what we expected . 
lasted just over num_num months and burnt out . 
defiantly the best ever for when it was made . 
i still wouldn t discourage someone from trying it . 
this ,  however ,  is just not a fun game . 
i thought it might not but was willing to try . 
i bought this bag due to the high ratings . 
i don t know how long this has been there . 
this knife is the second disappointment i ve received from buck recently . 
it is hard on the eyes and i often had to squint . 
my brita spacesaver pitcher is a daily hassle . 
for practically all the pokemon ,  you had two of each . 
i figured with it being so colorful it would be a huge hit . 
i was never able to get past the first couple levels then . 
i have num_num beagles and wanted just one stake for both . 
all you need is one controller which allows all the players to use . 
shame on this company for putting this crap in their candy . 
i guess it just was not powerful enough . 
all of the combo attacks suck ,  they feel very generic . 
good news !  except they don t like the food . 
this country has sold its soul to the lowest bidder . 
the company states :   healthiest for you ,  your family and the planet . 
i don t expect it to hold up very much longer . 
the handle should be smooth ,  but the clip needs to be tight . 
i plugged in the power supply to the hub ,  nothing . 
and i couldnt even force myself through the whole box . 
i purchased num_num of these num_num months ago . 
i remember the older ones having more threads on each side . 
it cracks after a day so then the polish chips . 
it s a bummer because they are so cute . 
i bought this just for the pouch for my compass . 
it came completely dull !  i mean it was really dull . 
i love the look of the new jabra stone . 
it s also a nice concept ,  this liquid water enhancer . 
did all the tricks but it does not adhere well . 
secondly ,  the sauce kind of tastes like watered down ketchup . 
i ordered this for my husband cause he needed a new black polo . 
it might work for halloween ,  but that s about it . 
last time i checked ,  david is a pretty popular first name . 
i suddenly found myself having intense itching as well . 
the patterns are cute ,  but that s about all i like . 
but the treats appeared dried up and old . 
last winter i fell on the ice in these boots about num_num times . 
this is like the mcdonald s of almond butter . 
i ve used quite a few pumps over the years . 
this tastes pretty much like your plain old liptons tea . 
but its the kinstones that ruin this game . 
so be prepared for some frustration if you decide to use this adapter . 
even using a good shock doctor alloy cup ,  these shorts still stink . 
even though they say there is a kickstand ,  there is not . 
generally speaking ,  what you see is what you get . 
instead ,  you have some sort of cheap foamy material . 
yes ,  the top is seated all the way . 
they are happier with a thin fleece blanket . 
i can t smell the sulfur smell at all . 
i should have said only that this whole time . 
you re gonna find a hair every so often . 
the bra quickly lost shape with each wash . 
there are warnings to not feed your dogs chicken treats made in china . 
other than that avoid this one ,  but check out the sequel . 
please provide accurate and actual information so your customers can make informed decisions . 
i ll place a piece of foam in the lid section to fix . 
if it lasted a year ,  i d give it five stars . 
it was a waste of time and money . 
my dog vomited every time she ate it . 
that s why i gave it a num_num instead of num_extend
then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender . 
no joke ,  sometimes purple if i ve been in them all day . 
gaba and melatonin work much better for me . 
like renting a movie you only watch once . 
limited position  up and down  made them not work on my particular bike . 
the missions are dull with hardly any decent action . 
the phone has frozen on me about num_num times so far . 
what you get is more of a pancake with an irregular surface . 
the product contains sodium hydroxide  lye  ,  which i m extremely sensitive too . 
sections must be very small in order to work . 
but for now i have not noticed a difference . 
you look ahead and see an open piece of land . 
it stopped working after seven months of use . 
the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture . 
put simple ,  the game plays and sounds like dynasty warriors num_extend
just coloring pages ,  that are not very well designed . 
also i think the team is not completely new . 
i am impressed with how sturdy it seems to be . 
however ,  the dog required medical attention and antibiotics . 
unfortunately ,  these headphones stopped syncing to my phone . 
the bumper sent is not even close to the one pictured . 
perhaps because the screen is a pentile display . 
the pouch has a strap on the back to serve as a holster . 
these are not inexpensive headphones and wanted closed not open headphones . 
i love the colors but not a good product . 
the people on the other line say i sound crystal clear . 
the rumble effect is just like the dualshock as well . 
a one cup machine is perfect for me . 
it smells nice when brewing ,  but doesn t taste like french toast . 
he liked the style ,  and the fit is okay . 
you either enjoy the repetition ,  or you hate it . 
now it has been num_num weeks and we see no sign improvement . 
after the first day they had chewed lines into it . 
i started using it a couple of days after it arrived . 
i ordered these thinking that dearform had changed their sizing . 
i actually liked this version better than the pc game . 
the other toys are made of the same cheap plastic . 
they have more bass and sound pretty good for the price . 
i started using these squeakers num_num day ago . 
i unplugged it and plugged it back in . 
the dopey led isn t very bright at all . 
rather than resending another ,  merchant finally agreed to a refund . 
if you work in a meat locker ,  this is good . 
it looked solid ,  but it s actually hollow and super dinky . 
the price your paying for this makes it a bigger rip off . 
i purchased it for my num_num year old disabled grandfather . 
not good when you use right before going to the gym . 
you also barely get to interact with the environment . 
thank you amazon for a fantastic returns policy on your shoes !  !  . 
it should be thinner or at least work better in that regard . 
so this is why i drop the review down to two stars . 
they told me go ahead turn on your router s security . 
we received this as a gift and were disappointed . 
i drank this stuff not knowing whether it had caffeine in it . 
when it got here the label ingredient was ferrous sulfate . 
no different then all the others on the market . 
maybe not in a pair of sweatpants or jeans . 
i find both headphone sets to be very uncomfortable very quickly . 
this scratching under the bed behavior stopped about num_num months ago . 
i ve used this in the past and really liked it . 
rubs against my pocket fabric and it is never easy to take out . 
this halo game is not near as much fun as halo num_num or num_extend
like another reviewer stated ,  it is like gum powder . 
i did not want to buy glucosamine chondroitin . 
this is the last time lucasarts steals my money . 
other reviews claim a one hour learning curve . 
i m not about to start by jamming earbuds into my ear . 
but i never could get this one to work on my laptop . 
you get what pay for with this item . 
not worth the time invested in putting it on . 
very under powered blaster ,  especially with barrel attachment on . 
not what i was expecting ,  to say the least . 
it would be nice you could buy just one or two to try . 
on the plus side ,  the coffee tastes great . 
they didn t ,  they are expensive and don t taste that good . 
others have said they fit well ,  but that was not my experience . 
i eventually wound up buying a real camera that uses rechargable batteries . 
to spin ,  you do one forward and one back . 
looking past the sweat ,  the player animations are extraordinary . 
like i always do when i shop offline . 
perhaps this toy would be more durable with less aggressive chewers . 
do not buy huawei products of any kind . 
it may be for some people ,  but i learned a couple things . 
i tried to give this game a chance ,  i really did . 
had the earlier incarnation num_extend which was far superior . 
other than that i guess it would be an okay product . 
the sound quality isn t great and the connections are wonky . 
this lipstick is a complete waste of money . 
there are three problems with the case that cause me to lower the num_extend
upon opening the can ,  it had a grainy looking texture to it . 
uv filters are less important in today s digital camera . 
i have had other fire starters that worked much better than this one . 
i am not a tiny woman but average size . 
the only thing these look ok with are flared jeans . 
not sure if they changed the formula or i got a bad batch . 
i turned off the keyboard repeat feature altogether and itt still happens . 
i will attempt to return these to amazon . 
i love the hat ,  just wished it would fit for this summer . 
back in the mail for a refund ,  order another . 
you fight when you want to fight ! combat scenarios are great . 
only ok ,  very lightweight material ,  and not all that versatile . 
i m going to be sticking to kong products from now on . 
be warned !  ! batteries are not too exciting but this seller is . 
as you can imagine i already wasn t pleased . 
i think i liked the soft black or taupe . 
i have tried num_num of these cases on cell phones . 
i followed the directions and used the products mentioned . 
put the probe in a glass of water .  .  . still dry . 
don  think i will buy shoes online again . 
i called nature s best as well as now foods . 
this cereal is sweeter than the name might imply . 
i figured it wasn t even worth it to try and return it . 
the charger is great works and i carry it as a spare . 
this was the wrong type of battery for my phone . 
i would not purchase this product ,  buy another electronic toy . 
don t pay unreasonable prices . so buy the regular version . 
with elf you are taking a toss up . 
i was out shooting in the rain and the ball head got wet . 
the motor is not very strong ,  so processing takes a long time . 
cute idea ,  so i gave it two stars . 
the chain was very low quality and looked very cheap . 
my one son loves think organic bars but he would not eat these . 
it took a while to learn the basics . 
i had it for a couple of months ,  afterwards . 
yeah ,  not unless you re bill gates or foolish . 
hope this game gets better or it goes in the shiny frisbee stack . 
the light is ok ,  and the quality of everything else is good . 
this was my go to pan for everything . 
so get ready to experiment with your own . 
hopefully that will give you an idea of the fit . 
i planned to use these for my mtb rides and around town . 
this worked fine until it didn t work at all . 
perfumes are supposed to have a greater staying power than lesser scents . 
the protectors are a bit smaller than the actual phone screen . 
i read the mixed reviews and thought i d give it a try . 
unfortunately this item is more geared toward grasping larger items or round items . 
and is now determined to make that happen . 
you can use it with or without a seidio case . 
you have to shake the cable or bend it to make it work . 
the product that arrived was the one described here . 
i like plantation molasses ,  but wanted to try something different . 
 review bassed on num_num yr old stepson s input  . 
they are supposed to be no kink  no tangle  chords . 
won t buy them again since they are not made in the us . 
it also arrived damaged and had to be sent back . 
the cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others . 
i followed through screen shots and trailers that were released . 
i bought this after trying the brownie mix which was outstanding . 
you just have to find the one you work best with . 
though i would not chose to drink this as my standard coffee . 
brute force has more intuitive firing and squad controls . 
the ear pieces were also tight around my ears . 
for the seed kits ,  the descriptions of the plants can be vague . 
they have more fun will all of those things anyway . 
it seems to work fine above num_num though . 
the colours were also slightly darker than in the picture . 
my dog never thought it as a treat . 
i am really tired of looking for face wash . 
it also falls apart at the seems really easily . 
if you want great fit and function ,  order this replacement and wait . 
they work well for my daughter to spell words with . 
tightening while pressing against the edge of that sheet metal actually hurts . 
tried the same thing at several different locations ,  had the same problem . 
i ended up using two cloths per wash . 
the graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at . 
this is a product that i could not give as a gift . 
to dlink company :  when are you going to remodel the ugly . 
i ended up throwing it in the garbage . 
it s like these were factory num_extend or num_extend
i d rather use oil of olay from cvs . 
the strategy aspect is there ,  but it is rarely necessary . 
they don t really stay well in the diaper either . 
this one got nothing ,  i mean nothing and it hurt my dog . 
this product isn t really as good as described . 
the second one i purchased was a piece of crap . 
this was advertised as a rubber watch band . 
give yourself about a hundred bucks and get a big one . 
this item has been a huge disappointment to me . 
in my opinion ,  it was a waste of my money . 
my suggestion is to save some coin and try the dr . 
i would think an omelette would be incredibly messy . 
kensington techs told me how to get it to work . 
could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off . 
this sight attached just fine ,  hence forth the two stars . 
given the price ,  i may only have a num_extend supply . 
my dog still exhibited anxiety with this product . 
i do not recommend unless you have dead nostrils . 
if they were any good ,  they d be long gone by now . 
i bought about num_num of these in different sizes and colors . 
even the motorola backflip gps works better than the captivate which is sad . 
the plastic smell is quite oily and overwhelming too . 
after we choke down this bottle we will not order them again . 
i bought the tung brush to replace a toothbrush . 
this is advertised with having a glass top which is a lie . 
i can t believe how many one and two star reviews there are . 
 a  you reply num_num minutes later with accurate ,  constructive responses . 
i m not sure what the hype is all about . 
i was expecting something more like a cookie . 
rpgs are hard because your opponent is beefy and strong . 
falls off easily and is nowhere near as durable . 
there is a reason these third party mounts made of metal exist . 
the phone all but locked up on me . 
what happened to the day when things last num_num to num_num years ?  . 
i called my vet who gave me the number of an emergency vet . 
the powder could not mix with water from the tap . 
i purchased this at walmart for num_extend a week ago . 
it s cheap though so i wasn t too dissapointed . 
i bought this soup based on the glorious reviews . 
it s just too messy and not quick to use . 
we could probably purchase better products in the local whole food . 
i mean ,  it was practically of no use !  . 
none of our num_num cats have played with it . 
better to look around and pay close attention to the descriptions . 
i ve had the same experience as so many others who ve written . 
it takes num_num sniper rounds to kill num_num enemy ,  rediculous . 
it s a cute concept ,  but so very ,  very tedious . 
it does work ,  but the loudest sound  via headphone  is barely adequate . 
it block uva rays and lasts num_num hours and is dirt cheap  :   . 
num_num for fun only because of the multiplayer modes . 
most recently the red part broke off of it . 
looking at the documentation ,  samsung warns users to  protect from moisture  . 
the first laser failed about num_num months after i bought the unit . 
the fan has nothing to do with keeping your warm . 
i am going to try other pod brands . 
this was over the top in my opinion . 
the fake carbon fiber back is peeling off so yeah . 
dont buy this if you dont want to do some work on it . 
this didn t make me very happy with them or their product . 
it s not that my skin isn t used to vitamin c either . 
i m just wondering when this issue will stop . 
you might want to look for something else . 
so i am sadly returning the lens for a refund . 
then they opened it up ,  too many people . 
so the search for a decent headset continues . 
i ll be back at the end of june . 
it pretty much doubles the size thickness wise of this phone . 
but these ,  well these i dont know what to say . 
this shoe feels very comfortable and is padded well . 
the zomm has a lot of potential to make a great niche device . 
in num_num yrs i have not sneezed with the hoover windtunnel . 
we ve been through two of these and both have the same issue . 
i don t want to use a speaker while on my cell phone . 
this case is very nice to look at but it s very fragile . 
the fact that the enemies  respawn  simply adds to the boredom . 
too big for him and too hard to pump too . 
had i know ,  i would never have purchased them . 
either way though ,  i will not bother trying it again . 
i have had this since august and i am done . 
spend the extra $ and go with a better brand ladies . 
it is dead nuts on to the second . 
stale !  and oh yeah ,  all the bags were stale . 
vista recognize the adapter but has no profile for it . 
the helicopters are easy to control and very durable . 
i washed them and that only made things worse . 
shoot until you get a decent group ,  then adjust . 
unfortunatly that didn t exactly turn out to be the case . 
i began to assemble the stand as instructed in the guide . 
i guess i m done with daisy ,  what a shame . 
instead of increasing performance it makes me not want to work out . 
i bought a couple just to try for the first time . 
the second delivery took longer then the original delivery . 
it sucked the life out of my batteries ,  twice . 
it does have sn odor ,  not as bad as others though . 
definitely not for a younger person unless you like the frumpy look . 
i can t offer a good review on this one . 
we got a bag of brown ,  squished jelly bellies . 
i will stick with the tresemme i ve been using . 
you get what you pay for ,  and nothing more . 
i wish i read the reviews closer before feeding these to my dogs . 
i never really used it because it fit poorly . 
it took me num_num seconds to figure that out . 
i do not like this game because its hard depressing and not fun . 
they just wilted a bit ,  then came back with a vengeance . 
it looks like it was threadlocked in place . 
i order the black toiletry bag ,  but received a brown one . 
she loved it though and cried and cried when i through it away . 
reading the ingredients on the back ,  i was not impressed . 
if you re expecting anything like arcade gameplay ,  look elsewhere . 
good luck ,  maybe it will fit you better . 
but ,  it s good for some functions like time shifting . 
and when i got them ,  yes they are indeed evil . 
about num_num weeks later they wouldn t charge anymore . 
the meat is dry and the taste of the meat is bad . 
from an art sense ,  they re very interesting and respectably detailed . 
not normal !  i awoke with extremely stiff num_extend
now you need to find a song to play . 
but for my surprise the product was open . 
i cant review this items for how nice or crappy it is . 
not for curly hair ,  regardless of your hair cuticle texture . 
the review i read said it works fine on the note num_extend
the player basically touches a square ,  and writes the answer on it . 
they tend to clean out prior residue ,  don t know why . 
fortunately ,  my iphone landed on shag carpet and didn t break . 
i ate one while playing around on the computer yesterday . 
used it a second time and my face was covered in red bumps . 
lol  :   few attempts that i made ,  he simply spit them out . 
they taste just like the full sugar bears . 
ordered three of these a few months ago . 
but i saw no additional or faster growth . 
only a year warranty ,  i guess i am out of luck . 
did not work as well as i had hoped . 
she tore the corner off and the thing was shot . 
then i recently ordered a third for my sunglasses . 
finally it fell out somewhere and i lost it . 
after i posted the above a used bottle of the shampoo arrived . 
not the color that it shows in the picture . 
i use to consume yeast for folic acid . 
i also changed the filter regularly ,  at least once a month . 
it was only a month or so and before the left channel failed . 
i really liked the results i got from this iron . 
i use their tropical and it works a treat . 
the buttons that you press play a portion of the characters  own songs . 
but i am not sure i will like it that much . 
i checked betty lou s website and it lists different ingredients than amazon . 
it is even larger than the dimensions listed in the product description . 
download the patch ?  yes ,  i did and it was still stuttering . 
not very durableand i have a tiny dog . 
if you need an espionage game ,  go with metal gear . 
it s all plastic which is great for a younger child . 
these applicators are a little big but they do the trick . 
and the supporting characters had some really touching material . 
num_extend makes some things well ,  these socks are not one of them . 
ok shoe will not order again since not true to size . 
there needs to be a  hand wash only  notice with this board . 
example if i needed to make a simple route change i . e . 
in season two the nfc west should play the nfc east . 
every department needs help in a major way . 
i ve been waxing my own brows for about num_extend
although it s cheap enough i don t mind because i bought extra . 
for the price it is definitely not worth it . 
on both these counts this knife was not successful . 
i dont believe cat food like this could be more processed . 
i think the blade is okay ,  but the sleeves kept sliding off . 
i would sincerely recommend everyone to steer of this product . 
all kinds of women of all ages shop amazon . 
i had such high hopes for this product . 
the advantage of burr grinders is that they  supposedly  provide a consistent grind . 
with a faster processor touchflo could be excellent . 
not much more to say about the product . 
the bag only comes with a few filets . 
because of the problem ,  they were ineffective in retaining my dogs pee . 
he washed them in our front load washer before wearing . 
i was not very pleased with this harness . 
quality is terrible and fit is like oj s glove . 
and this was well before the expiration date . 
do not buy the $ one sold by nonstop group . 
this results in lag ,  delayed moves ,  incorrect moves ,  and more . 
destroy thousands of copies and bury them in new mexico . 
i just loved these when i saw them online . 
i would give negative num_num stars if i could . 
at first it worked fine in both blinking and constant mode . 
they are very fine plastic but have no sharp edges which was good . 
well ,  i didn t make it through the tutorial . one word . 
charge doesn t seem to last a day without any use . 
i really like the design of these bottles . 
the bag has gone unused as a result . 
i posted the following review on the klipsch forums as well . 
it doesn t dry my skin like it did to other reviewers . 
the connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate . 
i recently bought a paleo baking cookbook and had such high hopes . 
after two months of waiting ,  we finally received the screen protector . 
but they just don t work for their digestive systems . 
a few days later and didn t have the same reaction . 
have tried it numerous locations with the same result . 
i misplaced a version i purchased several years ago . 
they leave very bad pad dander that spreads all over the room . 
i immediately ordered an num_num cup bodum french press and an electric kettle . 
but she was just not interested in it at all . 
i could still ping ip addresses ,  my network was working . 
my wife almost puked when she smelled it . 
leave your jewelry at home and take cheap immitations . 
they fell apart and frayed and became useless after a few uses . 
the comp team never subs regardless of sliders . 
which is exactly what i m about to do . 
it has a clear back cover that stuff gets into . 
where this product really fails is the microphone . 
and for the price i really didn t spend $ for neither pair . 
oestrogenic activity of parabens in num_extend human breast cancer cells . 
it does sometimes ,  but usually off when you actually needed . 
it s really hard to tell who this product was created for . 
i was very disappointed when i got it . 
given the limited selection of dungeon crawlers on num_extend
i like my camera to be slim and small . 
ultimately ,  this game is a poor quality chess set and nothing more . 
i wouldn t recommend get a kong toy instead . 
was very excited to get this case i love hot pink . 
together the people can control the market for our own good . 
for cool factor and sun protection these are pretty good . 
and that s just what mario party num_num is . 
my daughter hasn t even played with it once since we got it . 
i have a jeep wrangler ,  the tires are num_extend
unfortunately the kickstand on the case broke the day i recieved it . 
bad choice for cleaning dark stains on the chihuahua eyes . 
i ve used the salmon once before and they liked it . 
i kept the cleaning cloth and threw the rest away . 
so my rating is aimed at owners of extreme chewers . 
this product was not worth the money or aggravation . 
not crooked and bent from shipping but from design . 
one of those how do you make that error type mistakes . 
after that ,  it begins to drain the batteries very quickly . 
no chance of letting it anywhere near my art . 
the last one lasted over num_num years before it started making noise . 
we love uno and thought we would like this too . 
i will not order these or recommend these to anyone . 
they really like newman s own canned food ,  though . 
don t waste your money on this product like i did . 
this was one toy i thought would last . 
it s not inedible ,  but it sure isn t very pleasant . 
the vac no longer sucks water after dispensing it . 
this was suppose to be a new cable ,  it wasnt . 
it also rattled when the blade was deployed although not nearly as much . 
this was not the product to duo it . 
the reason for the  unbreakable  reference is that these things were originally ceramic . 
i didn t have any dial tone using this cord . 
when we put the second collar on ,  num_num mo . 
i tried align for a week ,  but it did upset my stomach . 
they used to have metal where this fragile plastic is today . 
i did not abuse it ,  i was rather gentle . 
has doen a good jog protecting my ipod touch num_extend
learn to read ingredient labels before you buy . 
your blood sugar may drop as a result . 
this pellet had great reviews ,  so i tried it . 
i will never buy food product from amazon again . 
now i never base my reviews on graphics alone . 
the connections were not flexible enough for the system that i have . 
but as a student in photography maybe it s just me . 
wouldn t recommend unless arms aren t small nice price . 
my initial order was just this num_num pack and i m not impressed . 
i was surprised when i received this scope . 
i used this popper exactly num_num times before the side of it cracked . 
it made me fill like its not meant to cut hair . 
it said nothing about that in the product description . 
i tried the different powers and object lying around . 
thanks for nothing ,  which is what i should have bought instead . 
you are provided with num_num extra cleaning heads and the cleaning fluid . 
the device i received appeared to have been damaged and reassembled . 
the result is a mouse that works very irratic with both systems . 
i had this radio for num_num months before it stopped working . 
i m sorry to report i bought this based on its great reviews . 
they are also near the most uncomfortable set i have ever owned . 
for people num_num feet tall and over ,  these will probably be terrific . 
any thing above num_num is very dark for white skin . 
don t listen to people who give this above one star . 
hips num_extend calf + ankle num_extend inseam num_extend
it has actually provided solid quality during the past months . 
the adapter worked the first few times i tried it . 
when i play a sports game ,  i want the whole package . 
i rented it ,  but i wouldn t buy it . 
i love starbucks coffee ,  it s about all i drink . 
i hung up ,  switched over to the num_extend and called her back . 
i was amazed by all the crevices and spots for things to grow . 
ahhhh ,  just the thing ,  an espresso beverage with milk and sweetener . 
the base popped off this converter the second time i plugged it in . 
very very disappointing considering remington used to be a good brand . 
comes out really dark and blurry on your tv . 
i purchased this for my husband as a gift . 
to cut calories and fat ,  add the water yourself . 
these ivr features have been around for a while . 
this is a toy version of a good ir remote . 
foolishly thought that this was a pointed stylis . 
this cutter product has been both confusing and disappointing . 
easy to put together , easy to use and did a good job . 
trying to target the dragons in this game was increadibly frustrating . 
i can see them mocking me in the mirror . 
the cream was also fairly thick and tended to clog my pores . 
there are no added sugar ,  no corn syrup ,  and no preservatives . 
they are a combination of latex and neoprene . 
i am writing this review because the crate actually cut me last night . 
due to the latest engine change in large part . 
the track name that cddb returned really is the title of the piece . 
this should be in a squirt ,  not aerosol . 
bright enough to identify image but not large enough to judge quality . 
the first bite surprised me because the flakes were really thick and crunchy . 
brilliant idea mixing a super low ph substance in with water conditioner . 
after a few minutes ,  i was sick of it . 
as for the idea of speed ,  use a pressure canner . 
i wouldn t recommend these ,  as they re a pain . 
i loved using this cradle for the phone . 
maybe num_num stars because it does hydrate and moisturize . 
during that time ,  it has disappeared several times daily . 
she nudged at it just once and never looked at it again . 
the snails are crawling to the surface as well . 
well ,  its not as good as the old cheap one . 
the valve at the top began leaking after num_num days . 
i have had a separator made just like this for years . 
the lid needs to be firmly snapped into place to work . 
they are still available on ebay but at $ a pop . 
i am am now out of the num_extend system . 
making a healthy picnic box so you can eat it anywhere . 
i was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment . 
i would not have purchased if these had been fully disclosed . 
i predict cg outlast won t last long on the market . 
it does not have the disney stamp on foot . 
i ve seen this vacuum advertised for almost $
my hair is not thick or fine ,  just average . 
i don t know what to do with this thing . 
i maxed out my sword and didn t even get a reward . 
i love honey and stinger waffles but these things are bitter . 
first off ,  as the other review noted there is no story . 
probably fun for them but i don t like them swallowing plastic . 
i also like the brush to be very stiff . 
these are more like counterfeit knock off in a reebok box . 
my new puppy could not be less interested in these treats . 
buy num_num from superbright then compare it to these . 
the silver and top parts are exposed so your device will get scratched . 
i never put this into the freezer to get cool for my puppy . 
i bought this router couple of weeks back from bestbuy . 
i like that this set has tops for easy storage for leftovers . 
nothing ,  even tried several times in several outlets . 
anyone can tell that this product is still in the experimental stages . 
playing this game is comparable to being beaten by an old lady . 
my cat shows no interest in this toy . 
speakerphone on this phone does not perform well in slightly noisy environments . 
this case was okay for a little while . 
just don t buy the hype if you buy this game . 
usb makes more sense at back of laptop than at side . 
plugged it into my machine and the computer shut off . 
i turn it on before i place it on my ear . 
the famous brand lasts me at least num_num weeks . 
i got this thinking it would be exactly like what is shown . 
i purchased this same product from costco recently . 
the num_extend does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software . 
upon opening the bag ,  there was a slight scent . 
i consider myself very talented when it comes to fixing and building things . 
i bought her a dsi and it doesn t work on dsi . 
on pure looks ,  this feeder is a winner . 
had it been more then $ i would have passed . 
it made my face look so skinny and my skin was always dry . 
she is tiny and the extra small was way too big for her . 
it s not like the one i remember from the old days . 
there is nothing fun to do with the design once completed . 
the gameplay is the only somewhat good part . 
these were returned because i was disappointed in them . 
i can t quite see why everyone loves it so much . 
so all my entries are markhome ,  markcell ,  num_extend
beware if something goes wrong and it probably will . 
she tried it and gave it right back to me . 
my son ,  like most young kids ,  is fairly tough on toys . 
i have used other brand name patches that did not cause the itching . 
it was a huge of waste of money . 
i wear between num_extend to num_extend in certain brand name shoes . 
seemed to pick up pretty well during a pretty chaotic game . 
make sure you know what you need before ordering . 
all i really wanted was to fly and shoot . 
i ve personally had better results with herbal essence . 
i was under the impression that all coleman products were american made . 
my favorite is macedonian halvah ,  more expensive but worth it . 
it would suck the stripes off a zebra from num_num inches away . 
the writing tip is num_extend the same as a uni ball micro pen . 
purchased the vtech v . reader for granddaughters num_extend birthday . 
i bought this salt after seeing it had mostly favorable reviews . 
i know i could have bought a much nicer radio for less money . 
this game at present is in terrible shape . 
oh you can ,  but only at one spot and only once . 
it s always been consistent in the past and we were shocked . 
this does not fit mountain bikes or bikes in the size range listed . 
these are some of the most comfortable headphones i ve ever owned . 
the rave reviews by others here are short sighted . 
i kept the piece that plugs in though anyway to keep dust out . 
the out brand does not cause the pee to spread . 
thought it was historically accurate to what the indians had . 
there is also a bit of a grainy taste . 
i bought it for my new puppy that i adopted . 
that s the best way i can describe it . 
i avoid any form of heat on my hair like the plague . 
num_extend there is no music as stated in the product description . 
you ll have to send a left pitch command to counteract it . 
this thing spent more time off than on . 
i am very disappointed with this seat bag . 
i have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter . 
i hope that one doesn t die after six months . 
the rice is imported from thailand and is very processed . 
the string has pealed off all four in two days . 
but for whatever reason this polish bubbles up on my nails . 
i look and feel the same as before taking them . 
they also did not offer to replace the product with a similar item . 
reminds me of kids cough syrup and that is not a good memory . 
i have literally never had such a terrible experience with a product before . 
i could not get this one to work as well . 
i hope you don t make the same mistake i did . 
the end of this wire fits a kindle . 
i ve been working with monitors and cables for almost num_num years . 
i got this case as a freebie when i bought my iphone . 
but this phone was a huge let down . 
 no ,  i do not work for nature made !   . 
we have found green mountain s breakfast blend to be very bland . 
i don t know how i managed to receive this thing . 
this book with only activities was not really worth buying . 
two characters so you can play the same game twice . 
it has leaked powder everywhere as i have used it . 
this toaster does not lift the bread out when it  pops  . 
i m bummed because reese s would ve been such a delicious treat . 
i wonder if my batch has gone bad perhaps . 
palm kernel oil ?  shame on you general mills !  . 
i told her that i didn t appreciate being treated this way . 
this happened consistently until i gave up on these . 
it felt like the blades were bent and therefore not moving freely . 
crashing into thin air is the real frustrating part . 
wanted to return it but my return dead line expired num_num days ago . 
induced my gag reflex the smell was just sickening . 
i thought that it can t be too different . 
this product is revolting in so many ways . 
but it just doesn t look right when worn . 
this player is too old and not worth the money . 
i prefer fromm and health extension over this !  . 
i recommend they specify which models it does not fit . 
not a very good or entertaining game for anyone older . 
if i shook my phone you could hear it clicking around . 
missing a ferrite on both sides as pictured . 
if you have tailbone pain ,  save your money cause this wont help . 
and it seems like it would slip off easily . 
but almost all of them only had one or two before walking away . 
you cannot control the flame on this thing . 
about as reliable as a paper bag in a heavy rain . 
i was very suprised to see this coming from lacie . 
it tastes like liquid metal with a hint of orange . 
i thought ,  the slim crayons would be better for toddler . 
and tag team modes are no different from each other . 
i have not had any issues with my new mirror . 
still looking for a better quality as these will clearly not last . 
i lived with it since i knew i was going to upgrade soon . 
i like bold coffee and have not had problems in the past . 
you can see the diagonal lines running across the screen . 
instead ,  resident evil outbreak is dead on arrival . 
it protects the birds from the weather while they eat . 
shipped to me with this heavy stone roller just thrown in a box . 
i agree with some of the other reviews . 
would not recommend to anyone with genetically high cholesterol . 
of weight before you have added a boat . 
i saw that it came from the cat bench . 
does not seem to do much ,  try something else . 
i wish i knew their return policy before i ordered it . 
a hassle to reset  heat in pot on stove  . 
i followed the can directions and thought the consistency turned out very poor . 
i lost my sex drive when i began taking the supplement . 
obviously proper storing was not taken with this product . 
so basic ,  in fact ,  that there s no gradation . 
i returned my pair and will not be buying another size . 
when sonic runs in this ,  it gets really glitchy . 
a crack developed on the inside allowing water to leak out . 
poor instructions ,  takes forever to grow and must be repotted . 
i like a dark roast  though not as dark as french roast  . 
with a silicone case ,  the ipod barely stays in . 
i am changing the stars down to num_extend
so i used this powder for my red velvet cake . 
they taste great ,  but are bad for the stomach . 
so the case looks dirty after a while . 
the controls and the camera angles are terrible . 
awful lot to pay to try and protect the brain from age . 
i should have listened to the bad reviews as they are all true . 
the clip isn t the best but it works . 
i thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use . 
so ,  i ve flushed this money down the drain . 
if i could ,  i d give this product negative stars . 
you need to get the washable for your children or elderly adults . 
 which is not what a bop bag toy is for !  punching !   . 
if you like coffee or espresso ,  have coffee or espresso . 
please save yourself money and stress and don t buy these tools . 
opening with one hand was impossible for me . 
save your money and look for something that is more substantial . 
i ve worn this a few times ,  out of desperation . 
after all that ,  i didn t really see a difference . 
but ,  i bought it so i could wear it when needed . 
i got this item for christmas and so far it s been great . 
the umbrella feels cheaply made just like it was from china . 
i made my purchasing decision based on amazon feedback and price . 
and it has a sliding lid that makes storage a breeze . 
it also made my hair crunchy when i used it and stiff . 
this is the strangest pan i ve ever had . 
bought them to replace a keychain flashlight battery set . 
the tomb raider series on the original playstation is a joke . 
fage only uses two bacteria that need at least num_extend to culture . 
i had troubles importing some num_extend and getting them to work . 
i suspected that those high ratings were only illusions . 
she developed a nasty yeast infection in her coat a few months back . 
made my screen blurry and made my front facing camera blurry as well . 
the jeans broke the first time my husband wore them . 
major problems for this :  you are only allowed one potion item . 
i was buying these for my num_extend old dad . 
too bad it doesn t function in the dungeons . 
my joints ache now and no change what so ever . 
the way the sink attaches to the legs is really flimsy . 
i chose the battery for my samsung galaxy cellphone . 
comes with itunes software ,  but isn t compatible with itunes . 
this kit looks cool but does not work very well . 
i highly reccomend buying this on another system like the num_extend
grand theft auto iii is no exception to this case . 
but i d suggest investing a little bit more on your device . 
i m a prime amazon member ,  but this product is not prime . 
went with the deal an purchased num_num for the price of two . 
i couldn t hear anyone outside my office as i usually do . 
i m not happy at all with this cocoa . 
the description is for ages num_num and up . 
i tried to smash them with a hammer but they were inconsistent . 
i bought this game looking to expand beyond simple puzzle games . 
too bad because the rest of the unit is pretty nice . 
these things are too hard and make my gums and teeth sensitive . 
not even num_num weeeks late that one started acting messed up . 
you have to constanly grap it to fill it . 
i ll be correcting that mistake as i return these discs . 
i tried a num_extend and it is too sloppy on my foot . 
the case i received was black on black ,  not blue . 
it has some lights and sounds ,  but that s about it . 
this charger puts out less than a usb port on your computer . 
the pants fit well ,  but i ordered a size big . 
new one was empty and clean ,  holds pressure works as described . 
this router came with the latest firmware num_extend
i bought this after seeing reviews raving about it . 
it is greasy ,  the greasiest sunscreen that i have ever used . 
the cradle was flimsy and headsets kept falling off . 
unless your goal is be the most hated man in baseball . 
tony hawk num_num is the best one though . 
i have a very hard time locking it into place . 
i contacted his nurse who suggested i give it a little more time . 
that s it :  i can t trust it on a plane . 
very pretty ,  but a total waste of money . 
it says num_extend depth but won t fit newer higher beds . 
not really huggable ,  just squishy on the surface . 
we returned it and kept the $ plastic one that works fine . 
it was a huge waste of my money . 
it was way too expensive for what it does . 
based on that alone ,  i cannot recommend this product . 
there are definitely certain levels that i just enjoy playing . 
i tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened . 
i have worn a size num_num panty for about num_num years . 
the enemy ai and the weapons physics are ridiculous . 
in the morning you want to get out the door . 
he will chase the balls when they go flying . 
avoiding falling ,  while wearing them ,  would be tricky . 
when making thesame recipe by hand it came out perfect . 
it s a much better grill than the george foreman . 
it does slow down their eating but was mislead by the size . 
the rings are top notch but amazon dropped the ball on this on . 
after finishing an entire package ,  i lost num_num pound . 
because its so small ,  its very hard to manipulate without breaking . 
agree with all who said this chopper was too small . 
the automatic camera controls are by far the worst . 
my fur baby loves these but i will never buy them again . 
after about num_num months i noticed shiny specs floating in the water . 
this is the second one of these bought within three years . 
it s also really heavy and makes the strap cumbersome . 
it didn t expand enough to provide adequate cushioning from the ground . 
add a cup of water and nuke for five minutes . suck . 
which by the way becomes costly if purchased individually . 
this cord should not be used for dsl . 
i also do not like the metal construction . 
all we can do is wait and see ,  and pray . 
cvs carries these in generic in a bottle for about the same price . 
i purchased these chargers for my wife s cell phone . 
it is a shame that there isn t a  sample  size . 
it makes my face bright red ,  swollen ,  itchy and tender . 
i have to say i ve never played a game quite this bad . 
she was using the wrist strap ,  just biking along ,  smooth road . 
i certainly am through being a supporter and customer . 
blade num_extend x num_extend x num_extend long  welded to the oval steel shaft . 
i followed the instructions for configuring it  a pain; see other reviews  . 
no warnings about the floor types appear on amazon . 
was watching a movie when they just fell off my head . 
i thought this would be great for the gk s when they visit . 
her old one didn t show wear for nearly num_num months . 
i threw these away and now use beer cans again . 
on the blueant all contacts sync with the headset directly from the smartphone . 
what is impressive is the amount of games in the library . 
i think i might just try a men s razor . 
the sour side is they do not fold flat . 
i ended up not using the pedals at all . 
you d think at this price they d be control top . 
otherwise you will get stuck with a cold waffle maker . 
the bad thing is that it does not work . 
i don t know how common the problem i mentioned is . 
i had to sit and wait it out . 
this and the other ones  navy ,  brown ,  beige  were the same . 
for two months it helped me keep my floors clean . 
maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair . 
plus you cannot make title matches in normal show except ppv s . 
i sure as hell am never going to play this game again . 
i bought these for the office and casual wear . 
guess what ?  it actually is . once again ,  stay away !  . 
this product has not smoothed out any wrinkles . 
if you had nothing else to eat it would be good . 
a couple of times she tipped it over . 
it is very difficult to even get the toaster to engage . 
i own several otterbox cases for other products ,  and really like them . 
the setting are overly complicated could be alot simpler . 
the first snap together and the pastic broke . 
got this last year and have hated it ever since . 
oh yeah and my curls were not that defined . 
apparently reading them the ingredient list does not convince them . 
from what i played ,  i did enjoy it . 
maybe at num_num years old they are just too old for it . 
num_num of the jars were demolished in shipping . 
i was mistaking and can not stand it . 
way too small for any dog that is bigger than the average cat . 
it is actually more difficult to charge your phone . 
the front piece broke after a few days . 
i bought this product for very cracked fingertips and dry feet . 
i thought not ! the game is very short and easy too . 
and fyi i dont often leave bad reviews or  hate  products . 
my scalp tends to be very oily with dry ends . 
it did not properly charge my motorola android phone or the iphone num_extend
next time i am getting my saffron directly from pampore kashmiri . 
it stopped retracting about two months ago ,  and totally broke today . 
at first i thought i got a knowck off . 
i definitely will not purchase another one though . 
this game s realism is as low as anyone who plays it . 
in addition big seconds  swipping hand in not functionig . 
it had a lot more wave than with other shampoos . 
if you love ddr ,  don t buy this game . 
i use the headset a low to moderate amount . 
luckily i found frys . com has refurbished netgear num_extend for sale at $
ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majora s mask . 
these seem to fluff and fall apart easily . 
tried with an otterbox protection case on when it wouldn t work without . 
the fit was good ,  the pairing was good . 
how they got so gross in the package is beyond me . 
i was hoping that the new viusally indistinguishable version would be fine . 
flimsy metal seperated after a couple of uses ,  not happy . 
% of that time was filled with frustration . 
you need help to get a snug fit using this cuff . 
please ,  don t waste your money on one of these . 
the only channel the sony picked up was the num_num mhz . 
the cheesecake turns out fine but the crust ends up being wet . 
i ve gone through two of these and won t purchase another . 
with the bold feature ,  the water drips in slower than regular setting . 
the appearance ,  brilliance and weight is substantially different . 
there was no noticeable difference in the shine . 
just glad our home didn t go on fire . 
they had much better luck with the smaller pieces  as did i  . 
you get what you pay for ,  and these are cheap junk . 
i have owned a variety of headphones over the years . 
these shoes are way to big length wise ,  and super tight . 
i needed replacement soles for my uggs but these did not work . 
this review will look fairly identical to many other reviews . 
note ,  this review is specifically for an otterbox case for a blackberry . 
mine jumps around from num_extend to num_extend in moments . 
they were delighted !  reasonable shelf life and easy to store and prepare . 
it leaves a bit of residue which i would not recommend for hands . 
believe the bad reviews and save your money . 
stuff on the top doesn t make it down to the blade . 
i have no pros ,  so i ll go straight to the cons num_extend
so it is a flimsy grill that flops off . 
the heating elements are thinner than a paper clip . 
wish i had researched that before buying it . 
yes he is fixed ,  still had no effect on him . 
if you want sexy and a nearly naked phone go with the ringke . 
i hear the num_num gig playstation num_num was discontinued . 
and whats the point in having retrievel in a squad based tactical game . 
the bra cups looked baggy and definitely did not fit me well . 
this product works fine when it doesn t die . 
i think this collection of dolls and the dolls cartoon pictures are bad . 
after eating one ,  i would typically be hungry about num_num minutes later . 
i never thought i would not wear sneakers at work . 
i especially like them for walking the dog . 
first let me say i had unplugged ups from wall and removed fuse . 
mine was promptly thrown away  after i put out the fire  . 
the applicator is hard and doesn t apply the product well . 
it does turn a different shade of pink for each person . 
everywhere i went the sound went with me . 
bought this phone on sale for $ at local pharmacy chain . 
don t buy it !  got one from ebay cheaper . 
this particular product did not work as advertised . 
ignore this game at all costs if you value winning . 
this game is not a persistent world mmorpg . 
i followed the instructions completely on how to attach . 
i really wish that these were as i d expected . 
i would recommend buying the fabric type harness over this buckle type . 
contrary to many reviews ,  i found this game overly simplistic . 
don t let the picture and wording fool you . 
i ve had this food processor for not quite num_num months . 
they are thick and heavy and really quite big . 
the dialogue is also censored and  naughty  words are replaced with  clean  words . 
i am disappointed that i did not get what i ordered before . 
i would look up comments regarding this product before making a purchase . 
it is very hard plastic and some dogs like that but not mine . 
the length described isn t the length of the pearl strand . 
this item just didn t wear well at all . 
picture quality is amazing when hooked up to a num_extend plasma . 
if you only want a desktop charger this is okay . 
we still had the medium to compare it too . 
i m really writing this review to warn you of aero tech . 
you have to open some ports on your firewalls  both tcp and udp  . 
however ,  taste is a matter of personal preference . 
not good for big god with sharp teeth . 
well built for the num_extend of quality material . 
quit wearing the reef ,  and the footprints are gone !  . 
it is not meant for high resolution capture . 
it taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste . 
i decided to get him the body wash . 
i reviewed this licorice several months ago and gave it num_num stars . 
when screwing them into the site base two of the posts rung off . 
too much hassle and trouble for an eleven dollar item . 
it would likely need to be cleaned out periodically . 
the graphics are par for a num_num bit system ,  not num_extend
the hardware is good ,  the software is very very bad . 
at the time we had no idea what had caused the reaction . 
with this very liquid product i am not so sure . 
then i read the ingredients list and the last item listed is ovary . 
these are ok if you just want to use a wireless earbuds . 
i will say that it is an original idea . 
i downloaded the drivers and software but that didn t work either . 
it just didnt live up to what i thought it would be . 
i ordered this pizza stone from my new breville smart oven . 
this ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball . 
this thing is sleeveless ,  and just not worth the money . 
don t care for these and probably will never use them . 
my series num_num protector caught fire a few years back . 
i usually love plan toys and loved the activity bus . 
there are better long lasting products out there . 
i have never seriously cut myself until i started using these knives . 
again i tried to reach pinnacle technical support and am getting nowhere . 
i bought this with my brother for father s day . 
it was folded up in the package which ruined the hat . 
i wanted this to be comfortable so i bought it larger on purpose . 
if that is bad for kids well there you go . 
i didn t read anything about them saying they run small . 
it stopped working properly and began clicking and the wheel turned . 
there are partes in this game that are insainly tought . 
this was not baked cheese in the least . 
check out the bethesda forum for help if your looking to upgrade . 
there are plenty of recipe sites ,  which have pizzelle recipes for free . 
i d rank these as the second worst i ve ever had . 
i got my first whiff of lemon once i added the water . 
plus you can fit the base of any reel on this . 
no ,  that was the size they were meant to be . 
gave it away to my sister to try . 
either way i do not want my cats mouth around those strong chemicals . 
but it still left my hair lifeless with no volume . 
we used in our bedroom and it kept us awake at night . 
i have tried multiple treats in an attempt to alleviate hair ball issues . 
arms are ridiculously long  i am not an ape  . 
i purchased the camco num_num anode rod for my atwood heater . 
however ,  the latch is a huge disappointment for me . 
i wouldn t recommend unless you like big cases . 
if you want waste ur money ,  go head !  . 
felt a bit  scammed  by this newer  ultra  offering really . 
next time around ,  i would opt to buy a lighter cutting board . 
the frustration free packaging is cardboard and easy to open . 
i had to return the item as it did not sit properly . 
even chick fil a gives out working watches with a kids meal . 
the face ball is cute and my son enjoys playing with that piece . 
this game could have been so much more . 
the num_num came as oe on my recumbent . 
what i received definitely looks more like the griprite . 
best product for me has been the compression bags . 
normally ,  this would work ,  but not in this game . 
there has yet to be any tea that i actually like . 
the color was marked fair to light ,  yet it was rather orange . 
shipping was a day early so not too bad . 
standing still or a t highway speeds no difference . 
i didn t notice that this helped my anxious adoptee cat any . 
i bought the for an old num_num computer . 
i think the description of this item is not accurate and misleading . 
there are only a few fighting arenas and they are mostly dark settings . 
the num_extend pin isn t connected for some reason . 
i woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed . 
after a week of use ,  the charger has quit working . 
i ordered this charger for my palm pre . 
so they ve just ingested a significant amount of plastic ,  oh yay . 
also its confusing as it goes from letters to numbers randomly . 
truthfully my cat like the milk carton rings better . 
they are inexpensive ,  found in any grocery store ,  and very effective . 
after several tries ,  i gave up and am returning them . 
this game had so much potential ,  but falls flat in every way . 
i like the look of this shoe but it is an awful fit . 
i d stick to the regular ,  cheaper omega num_num fish oil . 
and the next day more ants were in same spot . 
my husband tried it ,  too ,  and he wasn t impressed either . 
so ,  i am always on the lookout for something wonderful . 
the game was also disturbingly easy even on the hard setting . 
overall ,  worst experience with an amazon seller to date . 
both of these batteries did not hold a charge for even num_num hours . 
i did nothing different than i had been doing ,  ate nothing different . 
i suggested this to my mother in law to buy for my daughter . 
i follow the directions to a tee and rinse thoroughly . 
there are no smells coming from my tank . 
would make a good puke inducer if someone swallowed poison . 
it did not stop ,  or even curb their barking . 
if i could give it zero stars ,  i would . steer clear . 
i think canon num_extend is ok for outdoor usage and greatly priced . 
every shoe i have ever worn as an adult has been a size num_extend
it appears thicker than the picture ,  hood not exactly as shown . 
the graphics are horrible and low tech in comparison to other recent games . 
i ordered several other brands and they were stickier . 
it might be good for an older child . 
i cook my spinach num_num seconds on stove top . 
i didnt like the smell and would not ever purchase again . 
okay so i will not clip it to my pocket . 
the screen can definitely be read from both sides . 
this item is not break away as it claims . 
it s too noisy when i take it out at night . 
if i had ,  olay would be my preferred brand . 
the best i ve seen is num_num mbps download . 
upon opening to pour down the garbage disposal the smell became overwhelming . 
you let me down with this product philips . 
so i tried this stuff and it does not work . 
the game everyone said would be the best . 
unfortunately ,  that was not the case at all . 
extremely hard to get on over the head and put the arms through . 
the straps are itchy and the plastic pokes . 
so it may work for an animal with simple digestive problems . 
the technician sold me another netgear router and it s been working fine . 
i am glad i only bought one can to try it out . 
clicking or pushing buttons doesn t wake it up any faster . 
wish dogswell would manufacturer these in the usa again . 
i have an unreliable connection with this cable . 
this was the worst electronics puchase i ve ever made . 
i own many sandisk products and have been a big fan . 
we ll stick to the assorted num_num flavors we love . 
i think its a controller people end up loving to death or hating . 
the xbox version is sooo much better in all respects . 
i have had to have some adjusted in the past . 
using them is like having to push on stiff little warts all day . 
it charged my phone quickly ,  didn t have any connectivity problems . 
simply a means of getting from one area to another . 
avoid unless you find the latest version available . 
there are no good rpg games for this system . 
now here is the issues i have with it . 
didn t help any ,  it still tasted way too strong for me . 
this made the eye worse and very uncomfortable looking for my dog . 
claims to be for air guns on amazon . 
to make things worse ,  they contain gelatin ,  which makes them uneatable . 
it surely did not live up to the otterbox name . 
it was bulky ,  stiff ,  and fit way too large . 
the fabric feels nice ,  and it is comfortable . 
it clings to your face from the wetness . 
speed boost is not working and only with compatible router . 
i don t usually react that dramatically to anything . 
i ended up giving it to my son who has num_num cats . 
its what set the bof games apart from the rest . 
i m not sure what i d ever bake on it . 
 :    very poorly made ,  thin ,  runs small then shrinks . 
i had it for about num_num weeks before it quit working . 
possibly my skin is to fair for it . 
good luck if your life depends on it !  . 
they re such a great idea and got some great reviews . 
still work when power is off  unlike bose  . 
they can t go straight even on a straight away . 
if you want to really lighten spots or whatnot ,  use arbutin serum . 
the thin one works fine ,  but not the others . 
but ,  i couldn t find one out there that offered that . 
instruments are clear ,  as is the musical educational value . 
num_extend cm at least num_num adhesive bandages ,  num_num in . 
i say it is flat out greed this time . 
i am a fan of any horror surviver game . 
it is better than the num_num one ,  which is abysmal . 
i think i will stick to saline nasal spray . 
it was cheap so i gave it a try . 
given what they cost i was extremely disappointed . 
this means one more thing to wash every time i use it . 
for a similar price ,  you can obtain the chuck it ultra balls . 
whatever happened to a mist of bubbles like i wanted . 
but if it doesn t work at all ,  it s worthless . 
it can display the num_extend tag and use winamp s play list . 
my sangean num_extend pocket radio failed after num_extend years of infrequent use . 
this drink barely passes for a coffee drink . 
my dog is short haired and the stated size should have fit him . 
they are set with various popular types of bait . 
these pills are mega huge and you need to take four a day . 
the bags i got with my bag holder were much better . 
barely anything comes out of the side or rear speakers . 
would be nice if it were a few inches taller and wider . 
i bought this case because i wanted a rotating case . 
it failed after approximately six months of use . 
i should have read these reviews prior to buying the range extender . 
please do yourself a favor and try a jar of coconut oil . 
distance is less than num_num feet with static and dropped calls . 
in fact ,  this rice had very little flavor at all . 
however it does not work with vista num_extend bit . 
in the description it says they sit just below the waist . 
i worked with support but they couldn t help either . 
i would strongly discourage anyone from buying this product . 
the case would not stay on as it kept on slipping off . 
the pigment on this color blush is so heavy and thick . 
my husband and i can t help comparing these toys . 
imo ,  these pellets are too light for a magnum pellet rifle . 
my daughters wear macosins year round but she was really diappointed with these . 
again ,  it didn t work at num_num deg outside temp . 
i m sure everyone will think it s a cheap knockoff from ebay . 
will post an update on the shorts longevity in around six months . 
it still streaks but not near as bad as this stuff . 
gates   .  .   and paid someone num_num give us the injections . 
they kept coming out when i tried to run . 
after about a two weeks ,  it stopped working . 
the only stuff that seems to truly work so far is phenibut xt . 
my second problem is actually more of a realization . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
so they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder . 
the vocalyst is not an app ,  it is a phone service . 
it pinches the tops of the ears tight . 
the hat sits uncomfortably on the head and it s an odd shape . 
the new driving mechanic feels more like something out of gran tourismo . 
i am num_num years old and have just a few very minor wrinkles . 
they looked good but weren t nearly as comfortable as i was expecting . 
i would take android over symbian any day . 
does not taste like what comes out of a cracked coconut at all . 
i have purchased kong toys for our labs forever . 
also the earbud kept falling off when not in use . 
i loved the way these looked and they seemed comfortable when just standing . 
overall ,  this ice tea maker serves its purpose . 
i would say these are sized for a num_num year old . 
im sure some people like it but not me !  !  !  !  . 
the description said it fits lenses up to num_extend inches long . 
not satisfied i really wanted my black case . 
these are very inexpensive rings ,  and i had one defective one . 
it broke not even after putting num_num quarts in the pan . 
the guitar is a decent size for a num_num year old . 
i bought size num_num and they run extremely large . 
would like to send back but not worth the cost . 
my african grey loves rope perches so ive tried a few of them . 
you won t be returning to those  glory days of yesteryear  . 
the one in my car lasted two uses . 
i will likely gift mine away to someone who enjoys it . 
the only thing that is remotly fun about this game are the vehicles . 
this item is only the plastic container with the plastic pull tray . 
download the demo before you blow your $
bought some recently and found it to be very mild and tasteless . 
the size is not true to fit in my opinion . 
i mixed it with newmans and they picked it out . 
if you do not own this unit yet ,  look elsewhere . 
i will have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers here . 
but since it wasn t ,  we chose a different model . 
it becomes very frustrating especially when you re in a hurry . 
this is by far the worst litter box i have ever owned . 
i am an average guy with an average head size . 
i had a difficult time getting this to work . 
i don t have ultra skinny legs and the hose fit loosely . 
rest assured ,  i have placed my last order . 
i thought it said it was a double timer but it wasn t . 
the chinese who put it together are probably great too . 
in short ,  i did not care for it . 
one of the side arms that holds the phone snapped at the corner . 
do not listen to anyone saying it is good . 
the coffee is muddy and it tastes heavy . 
you are better off using a punch sent . 
maybe i just donate them to charity for them to resell it . 
i thought this would be a relatively safe bet . 
first of all ,  forget the noise cancelling models . 
stuffing everywhere i had to pick up and throw away . 
regardless ,  the product did not work for me after num_num attempts . 
in all honesty ,  i cannot recommend this pasta . 
i am so glad i kept my old one . 
if it worked it would be a top seller . 
made the dog and squirrels happy ,  the birds were less than enthused . 
the oem blade is a frameless blade just like this anco . 
i would upgrade my rating to a num_num star . 
now ,  i m not at all a smelly person by any means . 
if you re going to make a case make a case . 
thank goodness i didn t pay an arm and a leg for it . 
within minutes of riding the boot was saturated . 
all i wanted was a tang energy drink mix . 
even gta num_num and num_num were better than this . 
my lashes look no different and my skin is completely stained . 
the material is very thick in certain areas and too thin in others . 
it adds no volume at all ,  but rather makes them look spikey . 
actually ,  it only does one thing ,  wastes your money . 
sega would always fall asleep on the job . 
the string is simply too long and too lose . 
this case is okay but it adds bulk to your phone . 
problem isit even fails at that . it is very fast paced . 
national deals claims to have tested the cells prior to shipment . 
that s a pain and i ended up needing my son s help . 
it came on time but you get what you paid for . 
a long press of the talk button is necessary to dial . 
nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick . 
i have to say they were the worst sounding speakers in the place . 
also the fabric is ripping as it is quite thin . 
the handle is also not worth the price as it is flimsy . 
i hated it so much that i had to return it . 
shoot ,  i can t even follow the general directions for this game . 
its spent % of that time in the box . 
i had a friend loan me his ver . 
either way they atleast got back on track with silent hill num_extend
your not allowed to shoot people only buildings and vehicles . 
next time ill spend a few bucks more . 
the product smells terrible and makes anything it rubs up against smell bad . 
it could be the type of grass in my lawn . 
i have to admit ,  though ,  this doll is pretty . 
went shopping for a new power supply cord at radioshack and it costs $
the advertising didn t mention that the components are plastic . 
it is made of leather and the build is excellent . 
when i went to screw it together  .  .  .  . gently . 
it is not intended to be air tight . 
there are much better adapters out there that are cheaper and more powerful . 
my baby was bored after pushing it over num_num or num_num times . 
they are much too large for our dog ,  so i returned them . 
i have never wrote a review but for this product i will . 
i beat the game within a couple of days   .  .  .   . 
the speaker s maximum volume is just completely unacceptable . 
secondly ,  i wonder how long the finish will last . 
when i opened the box i was overwhelmed by the fumes . 
when the mach num_num came out ,  it was great . 
it yo have a parrot it will last about a week . 
i only asked for a working twinkle ball . 
this has been one of my least favorite purchases . 
companys should show us more respect than that . 
too bad ,  up until then i raved about olympus . 
i was hoping that this would be more substantial . 
least the arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a num_extend player . 
this stuff takes way longer than num_num minutes to cook . 
it also bent out of shape really easily . 
as soon as i can post a picture i will . 
the fit and construction are good on these slippers . 
to differentiate ,  aspartame is in the  blue  packets of sweeteners .

it can only be used in the newer style . 
the built in command system can not even hear you . 
logos on them and packed in a plastic bag . 
i cannot fathom how anyone would buy this kit at the price listed .

i ve had enemies spawn right behind me and kill me .

best product on the market to keep your headlight looking nice and clear . 
i liked it a lot when it worked . 
the textures do get pretty bland and unimaginative though . 
just thought it might help you out there reading to decide . 
ultrex was one of the innova brands tauted on hsn . 
unfortunately the edge i have been able to get is marginal at best . 
so maybe it would work for you ?  i just wasted my money . 
the product seemed to add little to not additional reserve power . 
once you put the levels together a piece of cardboard seperates the rooms . 
very disappointed that it didn t help my thinning hair . 
not to mention it s flat and almost tasteless . 
anyway ,  who cares ?  the carbs are in there !  . 
unfortunately ,  it just doesn t seem to do much . 
even more annoying was the poor sound quality of the headphones themselves . 
i threw them all no one in the family wanted to drink them . 
i purchased this as a gift for my wife s new iphone num_extend
i might find a buyer or just give out as gift .

the  clicky  part at the top is weird .

my num_extend old son was really getting into the dig experience . 
it also pressed on his nose like it was trying to smother him .

the other party can hear me clearly and i can hear them clearly . 
i like putting a base natural color on the nail . 
i haven t really used it because it is too big . 
it may just be me ,  others may love it . 
i spray her traveling bag every time a few minutes prior to leaving . 
in season three the nfc west should play the nfc north . 
it was a noble experiment ,  but i m not a fan . 
one lasted only a few days at best . 
why was this obvious oversight not caught beforehand ?  i was disappointed . 
the material is simply too soft to handle regular daily use . 
it is at best a one time use thing . 
they hurt my ears even at low volume . 
excellent customer service provided for an east return . 
note it also says some things about naoh ,  which this product contains . 
and ,  he will still only be able to carry num_num pounds . 
i do not feel the effects as i used to . 
this leaves the original iphone controls exposed but inset . 
apple is basically trying to force you to use their new num_extend
my raider has the air restrictor removed as well . 
i had the charger for less than num_num weeks . 
you need to bring back your old formula .

neither he or his brother had any interest in them . 
it s by far the worst lense i own . 
i have multiple pairs of wigwam socks and love them . 
then having to do it all over again . 
all natural ,  which presumably makes it healthier than soda . 
do not for any reason buy this game . 
the case itself is hard plastic ,  but it provided little protection . 
and don t be fooled by the other difficulties . 
please have your foodsaver available when you call . 
not wasted ,  but not what i was hoping for . 
so i bought it without smelling it first . 
i guess it doesn t really fit my ear . 
i had a problem with the client not seeing the router . 
although a minor issue ,  just think about the electricity it wastes .

the location you choose to go to has its own objectives . 
i was looking for a better quality of stainless steel .

z . z . top seem to be driving one monster truck . 
i started stacking blocks between two flag poles . 
i like cleansing wipes ,  and tried these because of the price . 
a friend purchased that one and it is much more useable . 
it takes very little ,  and it would last you forever .

they do the research and pick the top quality source for their products . 
this game is average to slightly hard level . 
look out when you walk in the house . 
the sub went bad in a matter of less than num_num months . 
these don t stay in my ears very well and were uncomfortable . 
hopefully ,  i can return it for a refund . 
good thing i can send it back for free .

saturday will be num_num am to two or three in the morning . 
perhaps a friend may be able to use this card reader . 
will have to search elsewhere for something that meets my needs . 
not like any type of lubricant at all . 
unless you like really overpowering smells ,  i wouldn t recommend this . 
i have a dolce desk i bought at target about num_num years ago . 
my pup was not the least bit interested in this toy . 
the design of the motor and the unit preclude it from being quiet . 
the material is great ,  and they look super cool on a hanger . 
time for me to return it for a refund . 
the build quality leaves something to be desired . 
i can manage ,  but my wife found them almost impossible to push . 
please do yourself a favor and buy the hori ones . 
my last one of the num_num was about a half hour ago .

i still have it but dont use it at all . 
i did not like the smell or thetexture of my hair . 
had a tough time getting them to fit and stay closed . 
it came and did not look like the picture . 
even when turned off it keeps making static . 
it also took forever for the burner to reach a decent holding temperature . 
i hope that s a mistake cause that s ridiculous . 
they are softer than i expected for cheap brushes . 
i zipped it up ,  then the zipper blew out . 
these may work on other dogs but not on my puppy . 
i will definitely not but this one for my child . 
please do not tell me any one would say this really works . 
and then ,  you ll probably be eating caviar with snob pie anyways . 
wish the board and pieces were all one instead of single pieces . 
the dye used in these substandard jeans smells awful . 
it left my hair snarled and gunked up . 
just about might as well buy a new one . 
it will get you where you are going everytime . 
no actual change in my skin tone ,  nothing . 
i received the newer version of the game that is very cheaply made . 
once it was in the oven it leaked everywhere . 
you might have better luck getting the gaming system version . 
between the smell and the color issue ,  forget it . 
usin it with monolights risks burning out the electrical system of the camera . 
amazon came to the rescue ,  as this was a third party seller . 
they dont work any better than any tight underwear .  . maybe worse . 
we bought some of these to give our ip phones some freedom . 
box got damaged and so did the sleigh ,  it was broken . 
when i scoop out the waste ,  a cloud of dust enveloped me . 
i throw away the fibre and consume the juice . 
an entire case of snacks that will be discarded . 
anxious gamers couldn t wait to get their grubby paws on a copy . 
ok ,  i admit ,  my computer isn t really all that great . 
instead of taking the short cut ,  actually use both . 
using it for now till i can get a better one . 
usually a five star rated product was always as good or almost . 
i used these pillows for so long and i truly relied on them . 
would recommend buying regular chalk for half the price . 
i usually love physicians formula s products ,  but this was the exception . 
excuse me sir ,  do you carry any magic items ?  no . 
this is a tiny mortar with less than num_num oz . 
to make things worse all stages are available from free mode . 
the waves even using a diffuser did not stay in sadly . 
i should have bought the spyderco sharpmaker in the first place . 
what an unconditional waste of time and money !  . 
before some of the fights you have to  weigh in  . 
cheesy graphics bad soundtrack warning :  may cause depressionit is horrible !  !  . 
the work professional in the headline is misplaced . 
this omission makes it tough to shoot indoors ,  at least for me . 
i m borderline skinny and it still won t fit . 
there are also no provisions for baking num_extend loaves . 
it is improving but still a pain in the ass to setup . 
not the smooth and protected feel i was looking for . 
it came bent ,  they print it on thin cardboard paper . 
thought it was going to be better but live and learn . 
directions for cleaning are unclear; cannot remove the  sponge  for cleaning . 
ordered them november num_extend and its december num_extend
this game is not worthy to be on the xbox  . 
took forever to ship ,  and it s not even all that impressive . 
they should have put those standard num_num buttons on the device . 
it actually covers the whole belly and gives you really nice support . 
the first battery was drained after num_extend num_extend
my minolta gear has most certainly been banged ,  bruised ,  dropped . 
they are similar to foam stress balls ,  but much ,  much softer . 
its a thick musky scent ,  not at all what i expected . 
really did not work like your basic curler . 
try to avoid this one at all cost . 
both have a constant hiss in the background . 
i am big fan of ea soccer game . 
sadly both by cats had just no interest in this whatsoever . 
iphone is a major waste of time and money . 
good product ,  but again ,  can t work with a case . 
repetitive usage like this could easily damage the port on the phone . 
film material is good so i gave num_extend
it s like great ,  these shoes are the perfect ballet flat . 
from one to two to three to four to five blades . 
from the step num_num brand i expect a lot more . 
the sound quality was not the best either . 
i have seen what microsoft is capable of ,  and i am afraid . 
this product is terrible for relaxed hair ,  and she has relaxed hair . 
neither of them is interested in this toy . 
it didint stick to my phone very well . 
this lens does not have an internal motor ,  which is fine . 
is in french ,  which may be why it is temporarily unavailable . 
her voice is very cute ,  better then amanda and baby alive . 
and we made sure it was on the num_num watt setting . 
doesn t fit in belt clip case provided by manufacturer . 
these were super thin and did not seem like cotton but more polyester . 
i do not have large or heavy breasts . 
they seem to arrive already weak from age drain or some other issue . 
bad cops are obtained the exact opposite way . 
for the rest of the day ,  i felt a little queasy . 
board too long ,  too much for young ones to catch on to . 
the support tubes are ,  under layers of carpet and cardboard ,  plastic . 
i bought this media player despite the questionable reviews . 
i was really dissappointed with the waste of num_extend with this gun . 
but i thought i could still make it work . 
we have num_num black diamond adult headlamps that we adore . 
needless to say it was not what i expected . 
i don t understand why they wouldn t use clear filament . 
disappointment . i do not recommend this if you have sparse eyebrows . 
i am in my early num_extend with very oily skin . 
they say the same things when they get hurt . 
the problem i had with them was peeling the stickers off . 
my hair is fairly straight with some really slight wave to it . 
i can t believe what the eureka was leaving behind . 
it hadn t been dropped or damaged in any way . 
my biggest laundry problem is my num_num year old mom on blood thinners . 
our dog doesn t want anything to do with this . 
if you re looking for sweetness ,  it adds a very pleasant flavor . 
this case came and it looked so bad . 
not sure where they are made from but probably not usa . 
as a human you kill dragons and vice a versa . 
the clasp was a bit weird but i figured that out . 
this is too soft ,  destroyed the pins in my infuse . 
one of my few num_num star review products from amazon . 
there was then a hole in my chest where the scab had been . 
all the required holes are there except the dock . 
we had purchased the same item in num_extend
with regular use ,  the blue plastic will unravel from the base plastic . 
the concept is great ,  but the quality is poor . 
or rather ,  lots of zeros and all kinds of crazy numbers . 
i do think it slowed the thinning but just a tiny bit . 
but when i opened the package there was nothing inside of it . 
i was pretty excited about this table tennis trainer . 
i sent it in to orion for testing . 
now ,  i am telling people not to buy it . 
not really the worth of completing the minimum word number for the review . 
the base is really hard ,  no cushion at all . 
suddenly a strange ,  almost toxic like odor is emerging from the filter . 
the most interesting ,  of course ,  is the fighter . 
amazon is always greathowever; these are cheap plastic tools made in china . 
the supposed num_extend year shelf life  on these packets are highly questionable . 
she had much more fun with a wadded up piece of paper . 
much easier to have it done over the phone with the coupon discount . 
too bad because i love the way they look . 
the product that came to me was grey and had a different coating . 
it s a different world now with cell phones . 
i ve never heard a bad tone out of mine . 
used this while camping for num_num days on the river . 
i d recommend any other mascara from maybelline instead of this one . 
so what s the problem ?  the level design ,  for one thing . 
i put it in her cage immediately after it came . 
the quality of the popped corn is ok . 
first of all ,  i have to agree with other reviewers . 
buy one at the store before committing to a num_num pack . 
i have owned several aero beds and other queen inflatables . 
can t use it in the street or store or restaurant . 
num_extend zoom very faster to start and fold back . 
learned lesson once again ,  you get what you pay for . 
one would think that would lock everything in well . 
just not worth the money you gonna spend on this thing . 
go into the router settings and install the new software; num_extend
i brushed it ,  rolled it with sticky roller . 
it smells more like a chemical additive ,  like parfume . 
the trimmer is good as a prop for a barber shop movie . 
i don t see why this should be so much more advanced . 
there were more bad items than good in this ,  unfortunately . 
one of the slowest ,  sluggish and dullest platformers i have ever played . 
that is my rationale for only giving it three stars . 
they were uncomfortable so i had them stretched and they are wearable . 
i ordered these for work at a grocery store . 
i ordered two sets of these to start with . 
unfortunately the num_num is a terrible dvd player . 
this did not work at all for our chihuahua terrier mix . 
it is full of fillers and not healthy for your pets . 
the coloring of the mouse is just a little too off . 
it does a lot more than this dog . 
i don t think i noticed any change in functionality though . 
notice that pomegranate juice is not listed as an ingredient . 
and i still have a full bottle of this thing to waste . 
this case arrives and it looked nothing like the picture . 
i guess i didn t have enough insects for them to eat . 
i have always been a huge mega man fan . 
i bought this case for my canon num_extend
the vulture and the scorpion were never hit villains . 
however it s all jazz and hip hop sounding . 
i really want to like them but i won t buy them again . 
but getting it hooked up is sometimes impossible . 
this has to be the hardest crunchy dog food ever . 
until then ,  save the disappointment and find another cutting board . 
that extends battery life to num_num hours per charge . 
it looked really warm so i wanted one too . 
chose this size because i m a pretty big girl . 
i was pleased at first with these slippers . 
i ve had merrell s that have never had this problem . 
you really don t feel like part of the game . 
i used to have a rio num_extend that i loved . 
i would almost say it smells masculine to me . 
i was told that this could be used as a dry shampoo . 
i just rescued my sister from the clutches of this cd player . 
zinc should be taken in a ten to one ratio with copper . 
inexpensive networking equipment is made cheaply ,  so defects happen . 
not as much of a challenge ,  perhaps ,  but much more enjoyable . 
my welbilt ,  bought for about $ lasted years and made good bread . 
im num_extend and num_num lbs and it is too small for me . 
it could not save after the second mission . 
not water running loud but mechanical vibration loud . 
i m sure other people love this and i m happy for them . 
this requires a lot of strength in your grip . 
i bought this for my num_num month old daughter . 
way too much coriander for my taste buds . 
the battery life doesn t last even if you charge it all day . 
i ordered num_num palettes and num_num sets of brushes over a week ago . 
the crown also feels very rough and flimsy . 
flavor is off ,  and texture is coarse and thick . 
the control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving . 
add that to the cost of the wrench . 
one sled already has a crack and a couple chips . 
purchased to update firmware on my harman kardon num_extend and num_extend
it said i was num_num pounds heavier then my known weight . 
i prefer the barely there women s invisible look soft cup . 
i have to trim these lashes to look somewhat natural . 
i wish and hope no one ever gets the same experience i received . 
too bad ,  since it does clean pretty well . 
recently ,  i have just chosen to go with the incandescent blue bulbs . 
i tried later by just putting out the gel with no food . 
not even worth num_num star  but is required to put at least num_extend
it pours well but a little goes a long way . 
get researching if you dont know about monosodium glutamate . 
the glasses felt much like a cheaper $ pair . 
there are other phone holders that cost more and are better . 
it gives your lips a nice rosy tint . 
the ground isn t flat like a picnic table . 
i will no longer purchase another weber product regardless of the quality . 
i like the shine it gives your nails . 
fits a little big and she can still back out of the harness . 
i had to use the bass boost option on all music . 
no one cares enough to really help you out . 
neither of my kids are interested in it . 
i think there are other options for cheaper that you can get . 
things cost more ,  making more difficult to play . 
kickstand does not pull out easy and pops out completely . 
the sound is not good ,  and volume is low . 
i followed the directions perfectly to avoid damaging it in the setup . 
the food seems better suited for finches and parakeets rather than parrots . 
and she is all to eager to do this . 
i purchased pair num_extend returned them because they were too wide . 
it`s as if it were made for a child . 
poor quality ! finally ,  i love what it says on the box . 
first ,  the beam of light is far too focused . 
i had to manually input my bicycle mileage . 
do not spend this much money before you cat has tried this food . 
however ,  this waterflosser is just too weak to do a decent job . 
she loves stringing beads and making necklaces and bracelets . 
have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images . 
well that s about ll we got out of these treats ,  unfortunately . 
it was at least num_num points off from my actual reading . 
it arrived cracked and the paint was chipped . 
scathing review coming soon . final word :  don t buy it . 
however ,  the face is huge and not very feminine . 
you will constantly have to reassemble the track . 
unfortunately ,  we have seen zero results since using it per the instructions . 
i was kind of excited to get this scale . 
bristles were extremely loose and brushes fell apart . 
the lens also did poorly with shooting a skyline at night . 
i like the noises that the truck makes ,  and the movements . 
this unit is the best but expensive $
the worst of it is that it begins with such an interesting idea . 
the blade broke after num_num months of using it just once a week . 
if you liked warcraft iii you may like this game . 
dora and diego on the wii are easy and fun for the kids . 
we also bought good quality larger stainless steel roasters . 
this is use to be my favorite ,  not anymore . 
the blanket is one of those get what you pay for things . 
i swear ,  i know how to use a bike pump . 
that means you have to have the actual software to use this . 
watching a lot of ufc i see they promote bsn products . 
i saw two moons !  i couldn t believe my eyes . 
i like these shirts loose fitting and buy a slightly larger size . 
but a num_num oz feeder is a little too big . 
it has definately cooled down my computer and has been a good choice . 
how is informing and warning you of something not helpful  ?  . 
a black permanent marker to stain the plastic should make it look better . 
i am still using ,  but not what i expected . 
maybe by now ,  they are making the holes bigger . 
my experience over the past four years has been mixed . 
now it travels at most a quarter inch before friction stops it . 
this bra surprisingly provides more support than the shelf tanks . 
they re good for spoken word ,  but not much else . 
i will say that it makes your skin very soft though !  . 
i even purchased the lipliner ,  nude which is also hobbible . 
wish i could return this brush but it is after my return time . 
i found a much better deal at costco . 
i was in a rush and try to be hustle free . 
luckily there are processes for these types of practitioners . 
i use it on my elbows and hands now . 
sure ,  it has a lot of metal parts . 
be careful stirring it or it will break up into little sticks . 
i found this product to be too flimsy and cheaply made . 
the hideous graphics first struck me when i was talking to people . 
i used this product as instructed and felt no relief what so ever . 
wasted hundreds on hoover and dirt devil s upright too . 
around the first of march num_num the programmable timer quit working . 
levi strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years . 
my husband doesn t seem to mind it so he is using it . 
i give this five stars on price alone . 
i do not have time to worry about returning it . 
it also is a better color than during the years of rogaine use . 
it made every little piece of powder show . 
then it begun to lock up the autofocus . 
you can find better ones in the grocery store ,  minus the carcinogens . 
nintendo ,  if your listening ,  please make every game have alternative methods . 
or go wild and sprinkle cinnamon on it !  . 
the ramps of this toy come apart more often than not . 
this review is specific to the black stretch . 
he d rather go rub his face on my ceramic sculptures . 
there are two wire bundles that run to the stock headphone jack . 
it s very hard to control the amount of polish using this brush . 
the goals are timed and a little too coached . 
this mousse did not live up to its billing . 
they have much more features and have very good metallic bodies . 
these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight . 
if there is any wetness the paints are too runny to work . 
i was really disappointed in the staying power of the product . 
i would never buy this flavor again though . 
my biggest gripe is the num_extend person  over the shoulder  view . 
it would end up in lots of crumbs . 
i was slightly disappointed when i recieved it . 
the company advertises this product as having  sweet heat  . 
the colors did not stay on my lip .  ,  very cheap . 
then again ,  it is better than resident evil :  survivor . 
i threw the rest of the bag in the trash . 
the pouch was so tight that it kept hitting the call button . 
i ordered these stamps for my grandchildren to use when they come over . 
the display photo did not display the jack either . 
it appears that there is not good contact in the handheld remote . 
have bought and returned three of these senn . 
if only the designers had worked out all the kinks before selling it . 
parts of the ,  edges don t even snap together . 
on off for the heat . the heat never got very hot . 
i have really hard water and it didn t help at all . 
i started using this lotion again and noticed my face getting itchy . 
the cops only seem to be after you . 
that s the only thing i can say at the moment . 
the switch that controls retractable prongs broke and the whole thing was useless . 
all of the knives i own are better than this one . 
not buying this without knowing what the real measurements are . 
i consider myself to be a good diyer . 
i guess these just won t work in my weapon . 
i would never get anything from them again . 
the mouse slides onto a metal rod and adonis simply pulls it off . 
every product is allergy tested ,  and free of artificial dyes and parabens . 
although another downside is ,  like another reviewer said ,  it is messy . 
conair  for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service . 
returning the wretched thing to amazon turned out to be wonderfully simple . 
no one will even believe they are fiestaware !  !  . 
it means nothing ,  tho ,  if the hardware fails . 
was able to install ,  configure and use a competitive product . 
like everyone says ,  the music is very loud and super annoying . 
i have previously left packaging concerns with no response . 
i m not convinced this is made of real wood . 
another person mentioned a buzzing sound when turning on the noise cancelling switch . 
the blue opal is not as thick as i was expecting . 
but the style is .  .  . well ,  there is no style . 
and even worse ,  it emits a burning smell when working hard . 
had to play around with the socket for them to fit . 
i have been a huge fan of otterbox for several years . 
i usually get bragg but tried this because of the subscribe option . 
i couldn t see wearing these to work everyday . 
i am unwilling to have to baby a set of pots . 
nothing remarkable nor disappointing ,  simply an average toy . 
this is one of the worst gums i have ever had . 
very uncomfortable and unsupportive . columbia sportswear women s kea land sandal . 
sometimes ,  saving a few bucks just ain t worth it !  !  . 
it has always meant quality in my book . 
got it in january ,  by march it wasn t working . 
once installed ,  you can play the game without the cd . 
however ,  the text on the screen is very small . 
you d be better off buying two apple charging docks . 
a thousand versions of num_extend and ipod type players . 
prospective buyers would do well to give some thought to them before buying . 
this isn t a product that i d recommend to anyone . 
i would used it twice a day after washing my face . 
my system stopped recording tv shows and so i checked the manual . 
it makes my hands shiny and greasy but still feeling not moisturized . 
there is no blood in the game ,  expect for the final movie . 
purchased this because it said it works with all valve types . 
not sure if it s just my unit or a bad lot . 
very disappointing to learn all this after getting my shipment . 
it does have a great smell ,  light pepperminty . 
the unit is not designed for adjustments to be made at all . 
finding a bra for large busted women is not easy . 
so i can t really wear them for long hours . 
i was so excited the day this product arrived . 
as presented ,  this is a boutique soda ,  but without character . 
i figured i had something burnt on the pot . 
the update speed of this camera is horrible . 
skip this one ,  get something without the dated graphics and boring play . 
i bought a krups toaster that burned toast on a regular basis . 
i had to replace with more quality product . 
it s not worth the  money  by a long shot . 
on top of that ,  this stuff gets everywhere . 
i returned it great idea wish it would have worked . 
none of my cats would touch this stuff . 
bottom line :  there was no  liquid raspberry filling  . 
i have rather narrow fett and very narrow heels ,  medium calves . 
all in all this doll is a piece of junk . 
this results in coffee particles in your coffee . 
i just became a proud owner of an xbox num_extend
i put the product in my hair as described . 
it became impossible to locate a station by number . 
it could take a pounding and keep going . 
the head has come apart from the center post . 
so i m not holding out a lot of faith in this title . 
i bought these boots for use on the ranch . 
spend more money and purchase a better rail . 
like the chinee noodles but too much sodium . 
however ,  they are not very good at removing makeup . 
i came across a blog with advice that worked . 
i told my brother to just give it away to whoever . 
my makeup still smudged and rubbed off after a couple of hours . 
velcro can come apart and the unit can fall off . 
these are the oiliest kippers i have ever eaten . 
it might work for some ,  clearly not for everyone . 
that is what my puppy chews the most . 
if you buy fins but them so you can have booties on . 
my advice is to smell first before buying . 
i m trying to use them with a samsung flat screen tv . 
i found this out the hard way with red paint . 
that is the main reason this game is inferior to tomb raider . 
this battery is dated num_extend but is defective . 
the pans are very thin tinplate ,  as is the divider apparatus . 
it has been about a month now and still nothing . 
really wish they had been like the old ones . 
i ,  as well ,  will be asking for a refund . 
i purchased a few of these for myself and friends . 
but nothing in the stores seemed to fit the bill . 
wish i could find good ones so i can finally take pics . 
at that price it s worth keeping as a novelty if nothing more . 
my kids didn t play with this toy much at all . 
i did not like this game at all . 
i m not giving up on goddess bras just yet . 
i will stick to crystal light and snapple . 
first ,  the batteries fit very tightly but they fit . 
my memorex num_extend player has num_extend of memory on board . 
totally agree with other comments written about durability . 
it is like you put on some paste . 
people may have bought the newer hoses based on my review . 
i was able to lock the door upon reviewing a youtube video . 
i will be trying to contact jlabs to send these back . 
sometimes it will sound when i walk by it . 
the only thing that worked was the wall charger for my htc evo . 
look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your palm device !  . 
i smelled like that until i took a shower later that evening . 
but ,  think about what might happen if you do have a problem . 
blasphemy ,  sir !  a pox on your both houses ,  mr . 
skip this one as it is just a very loud noise machine . 
the wood handle burned away and the brass melted . 
at first these slippers seemed to be very nice . 
the only other good thing about this game was the off button . 
my skin felt dirty ,  pores were larger ,  face seemed irritated . 
my dog is quite the chewer i must say . 
it drains batteries very quickly when you take multiple num_extend
i will update my rating once the new one comes . 
getting married ,  i registered for this calphalon set at target . 
gah ! nowhere on the packaging do i see mention of patchouli . 
i m just glad i didn t pay much for them !  . 
but the problem was they really don t taste great . 
it is a horrible game and it is not worth a penny . 
i washed it over many times ,  but it didn t go away . 
i just can t get the hang of cooking with it . 
everyone i had try this out got frustrated very quickly . 
it has to be the longest movie ever . 
i wasn t that impressed with the shoes ,  anyway . 
at three bucks a bar it is a sin . 
i applied to my long bangs and the ends of my hair . 
i normally do my research on boardgames before i buy them . 
it s a pig part or whatever i don t know . 
i have used this clay mask several times and it never helped me . 
i tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above num_extend
he is an aggressive chewer and loves anything that taste good . 
i feel like this thing pulls my hair out . 
it s really weak ,  much weaker than i had anticipated . 
i will not buy refills until they do . 
this line is owned by loreal btw . xoxoxolicensed beauty pro . 
it does not ,  however ,  last more than num_num days . 
the water bottle that came with it leaked . 
the product did not ship with enough screws to put it together . 
purchased these for a friend work works on her feet all day . 
one of the windows laptops tries to connect but will not succeed . 
the holes do not line up with the galaxy num_extend
we deserve better and it s not that hard to do . 
to make it worse ,  everything was balled up in clumps . 
it was bad enough that my husband noticed the smell right away . 
i was expecting something just a bit darker than nude . 
it didn t matter ,  every time i had the same negative experience . 
it is maybe worth about num_num bucks ,  suitable for airsoft kids toys . 
not a safe case or looks like described online . 
i never did manage to in the end . 
i purchased this hoping to make healthier choices in my diet . 
these are nasty leave them on the shelf . 
however ,  the actual bags have changed from last year . 
that would prevent havig complete access to your minors everyday . 
also ,  it wouldn t let me enter my password after unlocking it . 
the top bars that stabililize the roof became broken . 
but it s that gritty texture that kills it for me . 
i m still recovering  getting over my last giant zit now  . 
had to dig plastic out of her mouth and take away her toy . 
after that ,  they cracked on the bottom when the vacume was applied . 
i received my dana a few days ago . 
probably has a finite number of dishwasher cycles before they give out . 
long file transfers from the living room are iffy . 
i have wanted one of these for a while . 
spend the extra money and get something nicer . 
i got num_num of these in num_num different designs . 
i had this years ago for num_num previous cats  now deceased  . 
these don t have the three ribs needed to truly seal the bottle . 
some of my wireless electronics did not recognize the batteries . 
it has already had two patches and a third is being made . 
i use sunscreen every day and this never happens . 
mine started to rust within a week of use . 
if not for the num_extend then the psp instead . 
it feels super cheap and didn t provide any drop protection . 
we re making every effort to cut down on  vampire  electronics . 
this is what that seller is counting on ,  your trust . 
it slowly began to run and just stopped . 
i will not be buying it from amazon again . 
i cannot believe dermatologists recommend this product  along with cerave  . 
yet another bad thing i found in the game was the ai . 
however ,  it is a bit more runny than that . 
i can assure you ,  the controls are much worse than they sound . 
it arrived on time and i was happy . 
my cat got bored with this so fast . 
this thing leaks where the plug goes into the base . 
judging from the reviews this seems to be an isolated event . 
the old dos version beats this one hands down . 
have had two of these that i got from costco . 
the basic box has a num_num minute timer on it . 
i only play it for about two minutes . 
two stars because it was kinda soft and cute . 
these screen protectors did me no good at all unfortunately . 
they are very sticky and by far ,  too sweet . 
the principal sweeteners here are glycerin and maltitol . 
of the new nunaturals ,  i had to add my usual num_num tsp . 
i haven t had time to install it yet and test it out . 
it also has no definate characters to really build a story on . 
hopefully i can still get a refund for this defective product . 
i am still getting nothing but static noise . 
only time will tell how long this battery will last . 
perhaps i should have just got my normal size . 
sharp thin wire and small carboard pieces that a kitty could choke on . 
i liked the look of this case and read the mostly positive reviews . 
i have a kimber pro carry ii with night sights . 
pretty bottle with nice packaging but nothing special to back it up . 
it will continue along until it crashes into an object . 
i didn t purchase this thermometer for deep frying a turkey . 
really strange and not sure if others have experienced this . 
stopped this vitamin a few days ago and feel so much better . 
the image quality is ok ,  optics are good . 
tried to install this on my mother s rollator . 
ten big spoonfuls one day ,  maybe nine or eight the next . 
there isn t even anything remotely close to a story behind it . 
in the beginning they would sniff it and then decide against it . 
it did not work with the kids like i thought it would . 
a laser sight assist  follow beam to target  worked ok . 
for some reason she ate it in seconds . 
in long run was so not worth it . 
i m disappointed with this so called bike tool kit . 
it was emotionally pulling although some of the dialogue needed rewriting . 
it is a much cheaper made product that is very flimsy . 
memory cards only come with num_num or so memory . 
i have dry skin but any good moisturizer works better . 
i m afraid that the final fantasy years are done . 
this thing is so bulky and heavy and unbalanced . 
after my hair dries ,  it looks smoothed down . 
you would have to aquire a taste for this kind of chip . 
this is my first out of num_extend unique products bought from amazon . 
i just gave up on it at that point . 
it looks really good and it s ideal for my needs . 
when it is in your pocket you can expect dropouts . 
the num_num speed function is just a marketing ploy . 
first ,  i like the fact it does not dry out llike playdough . 
and i know how to and not to use it . 
she likes this food but not the small size of the kernels . 
however i had the same problem with the second one . 
i was too upset to even return it . 
hint hint :  after you process other veggies ,  do the celery last . 
it is sheer genius in it s design simplicity and functionality . 
i opened the box and found no manual . 
initially the demons were frightening ,  then the simple a . i . 
the packaging looked fine ,  but the cookies were not . 
its really not worth the num_num dollar price tag for only num_num stories . 
the link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed . 
if your interior is already cleaned ,  don t use it . 
i just received the pure stevia liquid extract yesterday . 
my eyebrows are slowly growing in but only in some spots . 
i thought my son would get a kick out of this . 
when you light it up its a different story . 
rookies that appeared in last years game disappeared in this one . 
i returned them because the glass was thick and not that evenly molded . 
that means it is alive and producing lactic acid . 
neither of my cats like this and they won t eat it . 
keep in mind this is not your typical roaster . 
i just can t wait for num_extend modern warfare !  yeah !  . 
too expensive for this kind of instant loss; buy yourself a milkshake instead . 
the pad itself would be relatively dry ,  but my undergarments were wet . 
rest just came out as a transparent mark with no color . 
they are less intuitive than the old design with buttons around the wheel . 
if you use filtered water ,  the water tends to stay clean longer . 
it even comes with the new counter strike . 
they are black metal and can easily strip . 
i cannot express how my dissatisfaction should influence should effect your decision . 
save your money and time and go with a more official brand . 
the drm policy and limit of num_num activations kills it though . 
i ve had it one month and it stopped working . 
the product works well but only lasts about num_num days . 
i contatc my bank and they will fallow this problem . 
then when i turn the vcr back on ,  it ejects the tape . 
my aged sephora tweezers do a better job . 
on the plus size ,  it doesn t move around a bunch . 
i will update and post what he says about his experience with it . 
i found better ones at petsmart with pull tabs . 
i usually find them high quality and smartly packaged . 
it had a few but not impressivly gorey . 
i really do hope that bethesda has given up the license . 
i am returning it for a competing model . 
the seller might be a good person but dont buy this battery . 
the plastic lid stained every time i used it also . 
i recommend trying them first before you commit to a whole case . 
at first ,  it wouldn t start up for no apparent reason . 
the waves are more like num_extend hairstyle kinks . 
however it wasn t two months when the magnetic clasp pulled apart . 
pretty sure you can find it in the dollar store . 
she was able to separate the yellow from just playing ball . 
another case of you get what you pay for . 
this game seriously needs to take advantage of the gamecube features . 
this is a pretty standard nylon sling with room for num_num shells . 
i returned these because the straps were too tight . 
the powdered cheese left a very bad after taste . 
this toy is truly a waste of money . 
inside each snack pack are two fruit crisps . 
they are already broken and the ones i have left are yellowed . 
this would have been a great game except for the actual user interface . 
the first battery held a charge for maybe num_num hours . 
unfortunately ,  i have lots of complaints about this game . 
i visited the el counter at my area macy s store . 
the rigid white plastic sides were still pristine . 
i ll cut to the chase on this one . 
basically that technique negates the need for the stuck case remover kit . 
just would like all parents to look carefully at the ingredients of skippy . 
so ,  i gave them another chance but got the same results . 
other than that the other seams were done nicely . 
the buttons were very difficult to work if they worked at all . 
the rubber housing was totally stretched and the plastic shell had broken clips . 
it looks less comfortable and more harmful than the gl . 
whenever the bananas get too ripe i make a banana milkshake . 
be careful if you re ordering this product for the first time . 
hard enough to navigate without variations in you compass reading . 
that way you can get rid of it when you get bored . 
too bad ,  i really needed and wanted to like this . 
certain darker colors in this kit will leave stains . 
i suppose it works for some obviously but did nothing for me . 
i had not started taking it and my dr advised against it . 
do not waste your money on this product . 
when i received this dol ,  my granddaughter was scared . 
when i made waffles there were definite hot spots . 
i don t know what else to say about them . 
the heel part is great but the rest is too thin . 
it seems there is not enough coffee in them . 
i had to rely on the information given on the loading screens . 
this line was the worst line i have used . 
even though the on light was illuminated ,  the maker never worked . 
the lab test was num_num and my meter was num_extend
they sent me another one ,  only to find the problem still existed . 
do you have any experience with this ?  recommendations ?  . 
so we returned it and bought a num_extend works great now !  . 
every time i order them they send something a little different . 
i bought this cover with my phone at the att store . 
i would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation . 
until num_num days ,  almost to the day ,  it just died . 
we moved on to other options and found a great one . 
i downloaded this during the xbox live gold free games promotion . 
i ordered these for my num_num year old grandmother for valentine s day . 
no one should trust a study with an n of num_extend
i bought these on a whim ,  they do not taste good . 
i am basing this statement from my experience with the sega saturn . 
i watered about once a week for the first six weeks . 
they did not fit and could not be made to fit . 
i was not happy about it at all . 
many i have tried i cannot get past the taste at all . 
it is marked for the garage sale pile this spring . 
i could not get this to work for me . 
did princess zelda try to escape from link ?  no . 
absolutely ridiculous !  i would not recommend this product . 
gave this away as a gift as soon as i could . 
initially ,  i thought this looked like a good opener . 
it s a really cute monkey but difficult to work with . 
our granite is permanently darkened due to this piece of crap soap dispenser . 
mine sit at the windows and pine to go out . 
maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites . 
it was great for the first six months . 
my terripoo had fun with it and liked to chew it . 
my very fine lines were accentuated while wearing this . 
they fell out just taking them out of the plastic wrapper . 
it did not pinch and i had room to breathe around the back . 
it works !  now this product ?  i cannot recommend it . 
you have to tune the thing by ear . 
this lens has the least amount of issues . 
interact are no longer publishing num_extend codes for current games . 
hard to play when you are missing a duck . 
asking for a new one and will try again . 
there was hot pink yarn woven in the shoe . 
if anyone has any tips ,  i d appreciate it !  . 
and it didn t do any good being all bunched around my middle . 
ok i am getting sick and tired of these sports games . 
the paraben in the product had already made me biased against it . 
hopefully the sizing works out better for everyone else who purchases these . 
the microphone is about a half inch from the face . 
after two washes these socks shrunk to the size of a youth . 
a hair dryer with a round comb will do the work safer . 
just got it today ,  num_num hour played enought for me . 
besides this the jacket is very very good . 
i have no clue why they loose interest but they do . 
the worst part is do not buy it from ronco . 
so much for soaking up all the excess . 
you save a bundle with these large sizes . 
it did not show any signal of signal improvement at all . 
unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well . 
our pets are num_extend and each one has their own pad holder . 
i did not like this pan very much . 
it was cheap and i got what i paid for . 
the lights and sound no longer work and my return window is closed . 
so i just took some more of my dr . 
i was extremely cold inside even though the item says zero degrees . 
my dog tore this up during its first play session . 
i recommend the nerf vortex line ,  which is much better . 
i definitely won t be using this on my hands again . 
they are not smooth like you would expect from a touchscreen screen protector . 
i assumed a larger petsafe door would be similar and suffice . 
it also works as an audio transmitter for your video files . 
perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is  bad  . 
one of them did anyway ,  and spat it out immediately . 
 my review is applicable to cuisipro grater too  . 
sadly ,  i like my cheap sally hansen better than this stuff . 
was too small for what i needed so i returned it . 
my unit did not charge past % even after multiple pulls . 
i imagine that many people like this product ,  but i do not . 
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound . 
after ordering i started reading reviews stating the battery was old . 
he would not push it no matter what scrumptious goodies i put inside . 
i m rating two stars because i don t like it . 
save your money and don t waste your time buying this one . 
i ve tried it on other phones and get the same problem . 
cheap and short lived ,  not worth the money !  . 
its very loose and creates air bubbles all over . 
this may be the worst electronic product i ve ever purchased . 
i expected them to break as easily as a graham num_extend
on the bright side ,  it has many natural ingredients in it . 
i really like gerber products but this one took me by surprise . 
my bad i didn t check it s reviews first . 
this cord has terrible static ,  and nothing i could do fixed it . 
this goes the same with a very similar other game called num_extend
no wonder i had never heard of it . 
plastic backs did not fit properly ,  overhung at the top . 
i switch back the to switch and  no problem  . 
even as a side dish ,  it leaves a lot to be desired . 
i had a plantronics num_extend and liked it a lot . 
it s a shame that you can t actually own this game . 
you re on the right track if you re reading this now . 
while it shaves good ,  there are two problems . 
this jxd rc helicopter would not even lift off . 
this brand allows urine to seep through almost immediately . 
i find this to be a poor replacement . 
great product ,  but i found a much better deal with another company . 
i do however love the leave in repair conditioner by pureolgy !  . 
they are the most fun both gameplay wise and comedy wise . 
so ,  these were obviously ineffective at providing him any relief . 
a full recharge will take a couple hours . 
the watch has been in water but no deeper than num_num ft . 
i expected some pain relief but got none . 
it was easy to flip eggs and other things . 
it really feels like a whole different team or company made this game . 
i watched the battery life just drain in a matter of num_num minutes . 
i would stick with my original one star rating . 
the total saved in the drawer is off . 
yeah ,  i didnt know what i was doin . 
i liked the size and feel of this . 
the game itself is also very linear and scripted . 
this mobile phone usb charger broke the very first time i used it . 
it s excess cleaning solution which can be cleaned right off . 
they should run the length of the insoles to eliminate this problem . 
it s not really sweet ,  it s bitter and gross . 
after reading the reviews i decided to buy . 
a lot of reviews here seem to say this thing works . 
these wanted to bend and didn t work very well . 
it is intimated that these connectors prevent that . 
looks cheap compared to the previous ones i used . 
too expensive for holistic attempt for pain . would not recommend . 
i ordered two to replace my existing broken one . 
i cannot recommend these . pros :  comfortable for long trips . 
este es probablemente el padre de los fps . 
this would be an awesome case if it didn t have that issue . 
beware that the only thing you will lose is money . 
it really does work great if you want to brush your hair afterward . 
the water tank seems unnecessarily complicated and a bit undersized . 
projection and longevity are poor ,  even if over sprayed . 
i used it for a couple of weeks and found myself disappointed . 
i have a standard issue dell desktop ,  with the default amd sound . 
let me start by saying i love smokehouse . 
fire is  duke nukem  quality ,  fat orange blobs of quickly changing pixels . 
this product is just trading one aliment for another . 
i wish this was just hard anodized without the non stick interior . 
it s a lot more fun and exciting than onimusha num_extend
i think this thermal top lasted one winter . 
i really like the shoes and was not happy sending them back . 
i will give it to my num_num yr old to plant tulips . 
now i don t even want to look at this stupid game . 
my regular wand actually makes my hair look smoother . 
no one can call this a boxing sim with a a straight face . 
it stripped my hair and made it feel unhealthy . 
if you have patience you will love it . 
they could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them . 
like many other posters ,  mine probably is defective . 
to work with different videotape players with respect to time num_extend
my very average chewing dog was done with it in under num_num minutes . 
tapping the pegs into the holes ,  there was obvious size variance . 
what an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage super mario bros . 
but for now ,  it s sitting in a corner collecting dust . 
i d say the game is worth num_extend stars . 
save your money and get one somewhere else . 
didn t happen before with a normal surge protector . 
overall reduction in fun vs heroes num_num and num_extend
every single other part of this thing is black plastic . 
this may be the worlds fasted  surge protector  failure . 
summing it up :  sizing runs quite ,  quite small !  . 
calling out ,  no problem ,  it uses the earpiece just fine . 
generally gun oil is just a lubricant for firearms . 
i didn t notice any improvement in my dogs teeth . 
another week went by and i was still getting acne . 
the game is fun but a bit buggy . 
in all only num_num out of num_num chargers performed as expected . 
wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged . 
 because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting  . 
therefore ordered the viking sd and it has been a very good sd . 
it is hard to rub into your skin . 
cassia is the most common type of  cinnamon  sold in u . s . 
doing thing for people instead of with people does not work . 
about num_num in num_num are now are having problems playing back . 
save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray . 
old son looks like a giant compared to this toy . 
on the other hand ,  it gets very repetitive very ,  very quickly . 
i will try to contact energizer and get another replacement . 
according to what i viewed on the dr . 
a second breadmaker worked for years and produced the best bread ever . 
when i received them i realized why they were so cheap . 
cats love it ,  good food ,  price too high . 
  very easy controls ,  but also pretty clunky and unresponsive at times . 
components are all good quality and look nice . 
pump works great but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired . 
i tried to bend it out of the way . 
i was concerned about his injesting the parts . 
it is num_extend traveling salesmen peddling  snake oil  to cure your ailments . 
but ,  it was claimed to have been marked down from around $
but the thing is ,  you don t need this game . 
the ankle strap also seems to fit rather tight . 
i am shipping this piece of garbage back today . 
wish i would have read the reviews first . 
a friend of mine bought the num_extend at a pet store . 
goes off every hour on the hour as the sun travels the sky . 
i had num_num to num_num at one point but returned all the others . 
you might as well shell out the money for a better product . 
spend the extra couple of dollars for a good one . 
the wonderful smell goes away very quickly which was disappointing for me . 
the right boot fit just fine ,  no problems there . 
for travelling purpose ,  these devices will break easily . 
they are extremely tough and as dry as shoe leather . 
this shovel is not the one issued to military . 
otherwise ,  i m back to a good knife and a cutting board . 
did not make one difference in getting my dog to stop barking . 
cooked the eggs ok but just not good enough to keep . 
in one game ,  only one player in the entire world had rubber . 
the grinds are somewhat uneven ,  but not terrible . 
stay away from this one and get a better used pedal . 
the product is good quality and came packaged appropriately . 
i think rpgs are on a down hill slope . 
they must be making these cheaper than they used to . 
after a few days it would not turn on . 
there are much better and quieter products out there . 
this so called nail polish thinner actually doesn t work . 
make house smell overbearing but wouldn t have minded if it really worked . 
i should have looked closer but not worth it here . 
now i have num_num more i m not sure what to do with . 
king s natural medicine asthma sympton relief a try . 
find another flatware set .  .  . this one is not good . 
the jericho brand has an exfoliant in it that makes all the difference . 
the color is nothing like the product picture offered by seller . 
if i could give it less than num_num star i would . 
i m running on a num_extend num_extend num_extend ram ,  ati rage num_extend
if you leave it plugged in ,  the  doneness  adjustment light stays lit . 
i d buy something else if i were you . 
it s a nice idea but i wish this was made better . 
num_num stars for the presentation of the packaging . 
my hamilton beach mixer is just sitting on my counter looking pretty . 
wasn t really sure what to expect when i tried it though . 
i was blown away by halo num_num and i still play it . 
a homerun ,  but the computer instantly tells you . 
this game really seems to capture the essence of baseball . 
that we havn t made a mistake in buying and supporting the system . 
i didn t notice anything while i was taking this . 
we purchased this popcorn popper this week and i am returning it . 
the pins fell out ,  could not be put back together again . 
if i try to access others ,  the reader will look up . 
i have drug store $ shampoo that is much better than this one . 
good customer service on when i needed to return it . 
it reminds me of cough syrup added to ginger ale . 
i got this and  course gray sea salt  from brittany both from amazon . 
my num_num year old son received this as a birthday present . 
i did my homework and started reading reports of independent lab s testing . 
yeah ,  that s not going to work for num_extend
as with everything these days ,  this dish is very poorly made !  . 
my dogs developed diarhea after two weeks of treatment . 
straight out of the box ,  it did not hold air pressure . 
better off with practice tennis balls which is what i usually buy him . 
thatsnot all bad ,  its not all good though either . 
whose recipe is this ?  save your money get something worth having . 
i would not pay money for this product . 
a final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky . 
this is my least favorite repair to do out of any vacuum cleaner . 
this results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination . 
i tossed this thing right into the garbage . 
i have a wide foot and these were tight; i returned them . 
i had no luck took it off and it sat on the shelf . 
and what is probably more accurately described as peanut butter flavored sawdust . 
very powerful but the noise is just too much . 
this makes for a stiff ride but not significantly different from other tires . 
it s so dark you can t even see past an inch . 
perhaps ghirardelli s toffee interlude would be more my flava  . 
it is keeping my dogs  teeth much ,  much cleaner . 
i bought that and i waited to came but it never did . 
the advertisment for this dvd on amazon was incorrect . 
after an hour of playing i got tired of the unreliable camera angles . 
if this one does not serve me well ,  i will switch brands . 
i wish i had listened to the other negative reviews . 
definitely can t put on the face way too oily . 
after about num_num weeks the sound stopped working . 
i ended up calling amazon and telling them . 
this pack will not last long under repeated use . 
i have ,  over num_num hours invested today trying to get support help . 
some of the door hardware is too cheap . 
this watch ,  like its timex predecessor ,  succumbed to water infiltration . 
i purchased the old timer cave bear more than num_num years ago . 
i dropped it twice at most and the clips started loosening . 
i purchased this and the yellow tint threw me off . 
we are really disappointed and probably won t be buying hoover products again . 
this flaw makes it suck ,  but aside from that it seems ok . 
seemed to be a decent trimmer ,  but very fragile . 
for instance ,  i find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective . 
also i could not easily turn off the phone when can not answer . 
from the product photo and the product description ,  these sounded wonderful . 
num_num is ridiculous . creating events is like rpg maker num_extend
it tells you to insert the cd and open their patch . 
here s my num_num num_extend has pretty reliable bluetooth electronics . 
poorly built and just barely worth the effort . 
not any different from regular cheap campbell s soup . 
however ,  the several years of updates have really hurt this game . 
as far as the  invigoration  i was supposed to be feeling . 
it takes num_num minutes sometimes to start the video on youtube . 
in my own opinion ,  this should have cost $
we have had this one now for several months and it works great . 
this shoe from dansko   now made in china   was not available . 
now ,  i do have experience zeroing optical sights . 
save youself the frusteration and boredom and buy some other game . 
spend a little more and get something that is going to last . 
from that time on they are never clear again . 
 you d only slow me down !  huaa !   what a . 
get yourself or your kid a psp because anything else is just embarassing . 
cleanup is sort of a pain inside the grinder itself . 
call it what it is a arcade boxing game with boxers . 
this is not something i have seen before with other conditioners . 
they get two stars for trying to be organic . 
my jvc dvd recorder was just introduced this year num_extend
my child ,  an elmo authority ,  doesn t touch this toy . 
considering the higher price of the cuisinart vs say a mr . 
alex was solely unimpressed by the cat crazies . 
first of all ,  it feels extremely oily when you put it on . 
i have attached a picture of the most recent deer . 
in any case ,  it didn t work ,  so num_num stars . 
if the toilet lid is open my dogs will drink out of it . 
spend a little more on a product that s higher quality . 
have adjusted the transmitter and computer positions several times and nothing . 
on that same day i performed some physical work around the house . 
sony wants me to buy a new one ?  ?  ?  ?  rubbish . 
i like my coffee hot so i can take my time enjoying it . 
but the shipping is so prohibitive it makes it double priced almost . 
spent hours searching and trial and error and nothing . 
the motor was turning but food would not come out . 
she gave up after two hours of this game . 
so this is where i asked their veterinarian ,  stephanie t . 
it gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry , twinkled . 
maybe they re a niche product designed for pygmy infants to grasp . 
it kept automatically turning off repeatedly when playing . 
our cat likes catnip toys such as these but hated this one . 
she has never really ever played with it . 
there s something missing in the angle of delivery . 
once you are on the track ,  anything goes . 
and my son is not a destructive child . 
in my mind ,  the game is about num_num hours too long . 
you have probably heard pycnogenol touted as a miracle health product . 
it also contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics . 
this game was on my top num_num wish list for games i wanted . 
wig tangles easily and it fits funny ,  bangs are out of control . 
i recently lost the hat and decided to repurchase . 
let s start with the good : i enjoyed the packaging . 
so you throw a couple hand grenades and kill them or shoot them . 
i d rather take num_num tums and drink good coffee though . 
i watched a bunch of videos of this product prior to purchasing . 
that s about half of what this model now sells for . 
it looks pretty on the countertop but that s it . 
i agree with whoever said too much software installed . 
i m actually using it with a panasonic phone too . 
there s seems to work pretty well ,  hope this helped  :   . 
but don t order it if you prefer bold coffee . 
someone should manufacture a smaller version with shorter partitions for cats !  . 
maybe it ll be better with a cheat or whatever . 
we laughed when it arrived and promptly sent it back . 
i tried it with few phones and it doesn t work . 
the gears just strip and the arm drops . 
you cannot use it again and it s just a waste of money . 
see if the list of clear stations remains consistent throughout your driving range . 
this feels like grease is left on your face . 
now it s too late to return it ,  unfortunately . 
and i have like num_num pairs of these dog nail clippers . 
it looks so good on the picture ,  i d eat that myself . 
this bike only has one sound and then off . 
we see no improvement on his beige teeth . 
as said in other reviews ,  nintendo offers little support for this . 
unfortunately ,  this has no cheese flavor to it at all . 
if i had seen that i definitely would not have ordered this compass . 
if i had the packaging i would return them . 
i ended up giving this coffee machine away . 
controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn t use analog . 
if you do ,  congratulations ,  you play too many video games . 
i bought these hoping they would be the equivalent of iphone headphones . 
this seemed to put too much pressure on the connector . 
this game is not as well made as we older people remember it . 
i tossed the hose and won t bother ordering a replacement . 
second ,  its a strange and unwieldy concept for cranking the car . 
there is no replacing that . slicing vedgies ?  get yourself a mandoline . 
overall ,  for a resident evil game ,  it isn t the best . 
not purchasing these type of ear sets any more . 
it was just a bad buy on my part . 
if this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design . 
but to make sudden changes without player support is plain insane . 
i hate to see sequels to wonderful games that turn out this way . 
the come in all sizes to accommodate different needs . 
the material they use to make these is very brittle . 
it took me ten years to finally win the game . 
if i move at all the device stops working . 
i m glad i only ordered num_num lbs of it and not num_extend
i use vinegar and baking soda to clean and unplug our drains . 
this wash cleans pretty well and foams nicely . 
queen was recommended by one of the girls at my salon . 
we had alot of doubles in the one we ordered . 
an uncle gave this to my young kids num_extend and under  . 
it hurt extremely bad and i ended up tossing all of them . 
i have a chihuahua ,  and he s definitely not the nervous type . 
the knob on the back of this tray broke after a week . 
sometimes just turning the laptop a certain way would do miracles . 
the large aperture makes for some pretty good bokeh for the price . 
battery only lasts about num_num hours ,  after which performance starts degrading . 
flavor not very good and does , t really fill num_num cake pans . 
you re going to be constantly attacking each other ,  directly or indirectly . 
so you have to take it out anyways . 
perhaps a puppy who has a strong urge to chew would like these . 
this how ever lasted two walks only before it ripped and became unusable . 
pos would not stay on cell kep popping off . 
after approximately num_num weeks of usage ,  it died again . 
for the price per pound ,  i can t recommend this . 
i absolutely loved lords of the realm num_extend
it was sturdy and manufactured with care to precise measurements . 
this is simply junk :  don t waste your money . 
the design is good ,  but the reception results were not . 
or better yet i should deduce that there are no car physics . 
basically ,  the idea is interesting ,  if not a little warped . 
i bought this for my son for airsoft play . 
my little boy s spiderman pjs are more convincing than this thing . 
everything your read about the picture quality is true . 
i reviewed the label and compared it to other brands . 
you just follow one straight path into every poorly designed level . 
you might want to shop around for something a little better . 
for almost $ it should last a long ,  long time . 
i absolutely love the apple flavor so decided to give grapefruit a try . 
but that was only for a few days ,  as i returned it . 
in fact ,  the two ports are connected directly together and behave interchangeably . 
i couldn t wait to get this stuff off . 
the two wires are separated by an almost imperceptible amount of rubber . 
that honor will still go to my wenger military . 
then again ,  i can not recommend smc either . 
the repitition of the maps make for one boring game . 
this will be my last oggi product for me . 
everything i have bought of targus has been crap . 
stay far far away from this garbage and any other jbl product . 
turns out that it was the after scent of the lotion on me . 
scope self destructed after only num_num months atop my mosin nagant . 
fortunately i already had craftsman pliers and screwdrivers of this size . 
i should have taken my money and used it at the vet . 
it s fine with me if you like them :  different strokes . 
i exchanged them for another set because i loved the sound so much . 
once heated ,  that is when it forms a clear ,  gel consistency . 
so ,  num_num star for cool looks and num_num star for trying . 
by the second day after stopping them the odor went away . 
as always ,  when i pull this stunt ,  i was disappointed . 
full disclosure :  i bought these  shorts  directly from the lee website . 
otherwise comfortable ,  and easy to open pockets for nursing . 
this product minimizes testosterone needed for good health . 
nba live num_num is a beautiful game ,  no dobut . 
i will be brief : the headphones are remarkably uncomfortable . 
this would be so much easier instead of us guessing . 
it might work for smaller pets but it is no good for ferrets . 
the brand does have a product that i love . 
in any kind of bright light ,  you cannot read the screen . 
unfortunately ,  this was among the worst starbucks blends i ve ever tasted . 
many companies use this as an alternative to parabens . 
these are okay for a couple of hours . 
but it is definitively not good for my type of skin  :   . 
needless to say i don t scan drives anymore . 
my hair goes a bit down past my shoulders . 
but this is not even the worst of the issues . 
very disappointing to see as a makeup lover . 
now sims are awesome this will waste your model . 
even when i am in the same room the voice skips . 
it is another of krups recent  piece of junk  products . 
it was a gift and is almost full . 
too much hassle to return so i just gave them away . 
this is a tasteless product that i don t recommend . 
beware ,  back up your computer like i did before installing this game . 
well i pretty much bought this mic because it is cheap . 
it appears to be painted with a copper finish and then sealed . 
when something doesn t digest easily ,  it typically causes an allergic reaction . 
you can not reset . these traps are a waste . 
maybe they don t get that in offshore customer service . 
but i did not recieve what i thought i was recieving . 
they are either on  very loud  or off ,  nothing in between . 
this should work just like an hdmi splitter but it doesn t . 
i will post again to report my findings . 
it is made in china  marked above upc code  . 
i don t think this game should focus on flying . 
i played all summer ,  over and over again . 
could not get to fit small sound hole . 
there was no way i could turn it into something tasty . 
just a product sitting on my nails doing nothing . 
what really bugged me is the death star attack . 
the quality of the fabric is horrible and pilled after one wash . 
it wasn t worth the hassle of trying to return them . 
it s hard to say if they re better than nothing . 
i have used num_num or some lotions over the past num_num years . 
as other reviewers have noted this has a mind of its own . 
moving the units around using the joystick on the psp is extremely tedious . 
too much money for a heater that dies so soon . 
every hour or so ,  the num_extend hangs for a minute . 
plenty of glitter and sparkle in those but what happened to tumberline violet . 
fairly cheap and the lenses give the world a funny orange color . 
so ,  i started reading reviews on different colognes . 
despite the fact that this ad says that it will run in num_extend
i am currently looking for another dependable router . 
nearly every shot has some blur to it . 
unfortunately ,  it doesn t hold my thick hair at all . 
i also drink lots of vitamin water ,  especially on the sabbath . 
final fantasy music just hasn t been good since uematsu became less involved . 
to get those feeling of being so young . 
buy yourself some older style pachmayrs off ebay . 
halo num_num is a disappointment for a number of different reasons . 
it didn t even fit the phone and was as thin as paper . 
it s taken me almost a week to eat the whole thing . 
then it started making only half a serving and turning off . 
put them together though ?  that s sort of what this is . 
i suppose it ought to be made out of something sturdier than mesh . 
i flew this about num_num times and have not crashed it . 
i wanted to be able to hang some wsshed shirts . 
i tried this several times ,  with the same result . 
i ended up having to use the smallest one . 
i have been using this cream for a few months . 
and ,  i cannot in any good conscience recommend this product . 
they were bery large and hard to break apart . 
or i d make my own from a crafts store . 
i followed advice to at least buy the shoe a half size bigger . 
then i realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly . 
there is a handle in the zip type strips . 
it is manufactured by sandoz and is prescription only . 
if you liked duke nukem num_extend you may hate manhattan project . 
i spent over $ at the vet and he almost died . 
i am going back to the manual unit . 
they are itchy at the end of the day . 
this game is so much fun in the first five minutes . 
not worth $ let alone what i paid . 
i would say this product is a bust . 
tonight is the first time i am using it . 
i am returning to walmart and will not repurchase . 
i tried it as it was listed for about $
also ,  her hair and eye color changed from the original model . 
christmas eve and we can t use this new gift num_extend
to its advantage the syma has another channel for forward and backwards movement . 
i would go to sizes up if i were you ,  . 
we had to throw this product in the garbage . 
now ,  i have many flakiness issues reporting by others . 
what i use now is murray s black bees wax . 
the odor is overwhelming and is all over the house . 
barely fits foot let alone ankle and calf . 
very disappointed when it arrived ,  because it was more brown than mauve . 
it functioned intermittantly with a lot of fiddling for several months . 
but for me it turned out to be more stylish then comfy . 
but when i put them on ,  my heart sank . 
i hated to have to return this bed . 
a vet is the only answer at that point . 
it was huge and completely took away from the slimness of the phone . 
that is a great improvement over original range . 
in fact ,  it works better with soap and water . 
im going to write a good review on the spyderco sharpmaker now . 
at a dollar and ninety cents each ,  that s pricy cat food . 
i have a bruise on top of each of my feet . 
save your money on this one would be my advice !  . 
i have an htc vivid and it will not fit while charging . 
good thing i did as the band feels really snug . 
i have been taking this product for a long time without complaint . 
the  i  and  l  also look too similar . 
the loop is too big to keep them in place as well . 
you pretty much need a separate board for every child . 
this is a blatantly inaccurate descriptionconsidering the unit i received . 
he advised me the case was already escalated . 
i always have to babysit the silly thing . 
not buy if you live outside the us as this will blow up . 
i have tried my usual popcorn seeds and same problem . 
it worked for num_num minutes or so and stopped . 
the product looked different ,  with the fruit more swollen and juicy . 
made sausage for the first time ,  last night . 
kit was poor quality and the screws didn t fit my glasses . 
i have worn rockports for over num_num years . 
i use a google pixel  runs chrome os  which only has usb ports . 
this is a tiny wisk and very expensive . 
if you have a heavy hand ,  no worries . 
this game will strain your eyes and give you a massive head num_extend
the hose is folded in num_num places  for packaging  which crimps the hose . 
the first sip was so bad i wanted to vomit . 
this is not the first time this company has messed up an order . 
this was the third pair of bluetooth stereo headphones i have owned . 
drawings you can copy are not very detailed . 
the best thing in it was the glow int the dark eyeballs . 
it sucks because they were incredibly comfortable but the craftsmanship is horrendous . 
you must apply a greater amount of muscle than my wife currently possesses . 
these pills are annoyingly huge and hard to choke down . 
this game could have been so much better . 
i can t read them ,  and i have reasonably good near vision . 
i mean its awesome but i got num_extend
but older cats were not interested in the toy at all . 
my dog ate these treats for years and he loves them . 
this one is just a durable which is my highest criteria . 
these do not go up all the way and are too tight . 
not as good as the previous version of these brushes . 
but the inability to control your fielders is not a good thing . 
you can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge . 
this is a horrible product ,  the graphics are so bad . 
so about now im putting red on over blonde bleached hair . 
i bought this bluetooth after using another model of plantronics bluetooth to death . 
i have spent over $ on nokia phones that are now useless . 
the socks fit is normal to the size . 
do not order these bbs unless you want to ruin your gun . 
will just grab another one since the blades are finally getting too dull . 
my skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks . 
second ,  and lastly ,  the characters are ugly expecially the male knights . 
it is powerless and cuts worse than her num_num year old knife does . 
this rope broke within num_num month of me using . 
if you order maybe order a size smaller than your size . 
i am having an awful time finding jeans to wear at the waist . 
as far as cleaning i think it did a fair job of that . 
this glasses did not fit well coming out of the box . 
the plastic was broke and would not latch . 
pretty much every other nikon lens out there is sharper than this one . 
my dogs love the act of drinking out of the fountain . 
i ve never had so much trouble getting a game to play . 
bought these for a third of what is being advertised now . 
my cats all hated this style of litter box . 
if you want total protection then this is not the case for you . 
this is one of the worst wigs i ve ever ordered . 
all i can see is money in my dustpan . 
i had high hopes ,  but it just didn t work for me . 
if i get items in there they remain difficult to reach . 
it is optically and mechanically a pretty ok lens . 
i followed the directions but the eggs still stick . 
my husband used this shampoo and was impressed with it at all . 
love the black cable that it came with . 
its more like a hair gel than a real pomade . 
i think body type may determine how comfortable and successful this band works . 
the first category  type num_num and num_extend you will notice is hydrolyzed collagen . 
the idea behind this trap is great but it failed to work . 
i know it s pressed paper and it looks good . 
even though i used very little and wiped my fingers with tissue paper . 
this one is poor when compared to others . 
i am using a braun num_num series now ,  significantly better shaver . 
i ordered two of these for my taurus num_num shooter . 
dont waste money on this and look for another product . 
the bottle slips out of it and ends up on the floor . 
but hey it s a lot better than nintendo s virtual boy . 
served chilled ,  it basically has the taste and consistency of liquid yogurt . 
i love cherries ,  so i was excited to receive this product . 
it is a wireless keyboard and mouse combination . 
we couldn t figure out how it would ever work . 
i cannot describe what a totally different game it is . 
as the other reviewers stated ,  this is literally just a stand . 
even more disappointed in this than i am any other heel support . 
everything on screen is trying to distract you from playing the game . 
could be these are boys sizes ,  definitely not a men s thermal . 
these crackers weren t burnt but they sure tasted like it . 
you cannot return the stayaway motion activated products . 
was treated by a doctor several times and missed several days of work . 
my cats did eat this food ,  in fact they really enjoyed it . 
what it is really only good at is mixing bread dough . 
have several pairs of crocs in other styles and always wear a size num_extend
this is my last try with plantronic products . 
the product seems very sturdy and works as described . 
the viewing field with this product in place is far too wide . 
when you change  some  configuration settings ,  it will spontaneously lose other ones . 
but ,  it just did not help enough to continue . 
i have maybe num_extend of carpet in my home . 
all i have to say is that this game is horrible . 
overall decent taste ,  but not what i expected . 
it s too difficult for her to drink from . 
the leaves you can quote  run through  you can only run through once . 
it is simply poorly quality and not made to last . 
it looks nice but the material is hot and doesn t breathe . 
this product does not do the job as advertised . 
i ve been buying football games since the nes days . 
the speed is so fast it is hard to move . 
unacceptable . these traps are useful ,  however ,  for trapping crawling insects . 
the amhybird stylus ,  in contrast ,  is very quiet to use . 
then the conditioner left my hair feeling like straw . 
taking the items out of the packaging was challenging ,  they flew everywhere . 
the graphics ,  combat system ,  and character development system are well made . 
i believe a table should have a solid top . 
it was not worth the cost of postage to return it . 
however ,  i quickly learned that this desk has a major flaw . 
he freaked out when i put him on it . 
a chinois is a conical fine mesh strainer . 
the over the ear loop must be removed for recharging . 
it goes on easily and is easy to remove . 
in most cases it seems the designers think of everything . 
it did not track the satellites initially so i returned it . 
after looking closely ,  she discovered some mildew as well . 
maybe it just works more for some cats than for others . 
bought these because claimed they would have wider thighs and seat . 
in this area ,  the pocket pc is way simpler . 
quite a shame ,  considering the same musical composers from ct are here . 
but they are comfortable wearing in the house . 
but all it did do was leave my face looking streaky . 
hd light on solid ,  drive disappeared ,  and computer started running badly . 
product is great ,  but we pulled out the rolls and measured them . 
my daughter liked them for the novelty of eating a bun again . 
i guess i ll just stick with the plastic boxes that b+w provide . 
this poacher seemed a good choice and had a good rating . 
the replacement had its handle welded on quite noticeably crooked . 
this is an adorable case ,  but lets be realistic . 
it falls over ,  it hurts you when it does . 
i didn t like it because it made my scalp very itchy . 
garber s formulas may be taken together at the same time . 
alas ,  they are very wavy ,  the distortion is quite disorienting . 
maybe if i devoted more time to the project . 
stay away from shifty num_extend party amazon sellers . 
it was just shoddy workmanship and certainly showed little to no quality control . 
it puts in maybe half of what i get from my apple cable . 
this happened when i ordered something from them previously . 
if you are hanging delicates ,  do not purchase this . 
it was also too short to provide a gentle incline . 
it made my hair shed like crazy and i dont like that . 
a friend uses the num_extend with otterbox defender . 
i have to say i would have to go with their assessments . 
this doesn t happen when it s turned itself off . 
just about everything else i didn t mention that was good . 
it is powerful and picks up a lot of deep down dirt . 
if your boat weights more then a num_extend row boat ,  stay away . 
in the end i found it uncomfortable and unnecessary . 
i should have read the reviews and believed them . 
this game stole dozens of hours of my friend s life . 
it doesn t really clean up the smell from my dogs  mouths . 
looks like it has tint till it goes on . 
the directions were very good ,  and the pieces seem pretty durable . 
now the suction cup is attached and useless . 
my son did not like this very much . 
does not protect sides of vita during a fall . 
this is very disappointing to say the least . 
we love nerf guns and have many ,  many of them . 
the point of a car charger is to charge a smartphone . 
these leggings are really thin and somewhat sheer . 
i tried this for num_num months with out any curl enhancement . 
i am not able to use it at all . 
i would love to cut sugar out of my diet . 
this was even after i cleaned the disc . 
i like figs ,  but i was not fond of these . 
this one may have just been a bad example . 
the fact that you have to focus each eye separately is a pain . 
i also didn t find it works as well as % ceylon . 
also ,  the psp can do more than the ds . 
but i think im just going to throw it in the garbage . 
it just looked better on pricing by charging more on shipping cost . 
repairs were same cost as replacement ,  so we trashed it . 
difficult to mount ,  the spacing of the whole is odd . 
i guess yo get what you pay for . 
all organic ?  wonderful !  $ a can ?  kinda pricy . 
this is sitting in a drawer right now . 
it was made to look that way ,  no doubt . 
it will quickly bore anyone with much intelligence or above the age of num_extend
i really need help with my soft ,  ridged nails . 
although it works i do not reccomend it . karlac . 
then the tubing is almost clogged with filth . 
i will not recommend num_extend party num_extend games . 
took me a few days to realize what it was . 
too sweet ,  i don t know why but it is . 
its way to stiff and the vibration wasn t what i expected . 
i was very excited to try the latte . 
otherwise ,  throw down your money for something a little better . 
or you close out the valve ,  and you trap the air in . 
by the end of the trip ,  it was toast . 
and they are great for a num_extend game ,  but there are problems . 
there is literally no give to the shoe . 
on top of that the design on the main character is pretty nifty . 
this is really the only way to get items from enemies . 
if someone can tell me how ,  i will change my review . 
do plenty of research before buying any probiotic is my advice . 
i followed the enclosed directions to the tee . 
funny ,  but that sounds like nothing more than a job to me . 
the fit and finish of the leather flip case was excellent . 
if you are in a similar position ,  be cautious taking this product . 
i tried it again and my skin felt itchy and uncomfortable . 
still ,  the graphics ended up being downright awful . 
there s no way i could get all the way through this thing . 
there is no way i m ever wearing these boots again . 
however ,  my dog does not like these at all . 
my husband and i bought this toy for my num_num month old daughter . 
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product . 
the  platter  had split into two separate pieces . 
contacted amazon via chat and got a refund . 
i took this and noticed no improvement whatsoever . 
without even trying to tip it ,  it dumps down hard . 
i figured it was time for a new one and i ordered one . 
complement this with foamy  soy  milk from a capresso . 
be prepared to insert new batteries each time you use it . 
the colors are great ,  that s why i purchased them . 
i could not get my num_extend old sons foot in this boot . 
off i go to put in another num_num dollars for a battery . 
and ammo for your weapon can get very scare in a heated battle . 
this is our second citrus magic product and will be our last . 
i have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking . 
these brushes are not even worth num_extend a brush . 
i have no use for the pieces of plastic . 
i just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment . 
defective ! i bought my coffemaker six months ago on amazon . 
this product compared to the old screen protected is extremely poor quality . 
in all actuality i won t buy anymore but wanted to try them . 
i wore it once and some of the beads are already coming off . 
i finished the cup ,  but i certainly wouldn t buy it .

good game if you need a good laugh . 
you can drag and drop as you see fit . 
it has to do with the fact that it only supports xd mem . 
at least the sound is still good ,  but that s it . 
when you view your xbox hd memory it only says num_extend blocks . 
we ll be returning this immediately to petco with gloves on . 
all of my dogs got very sick while on this . 
you may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape . 
is this an agreement with hyperion to censor ?  . 
maybe it will work for someone that does not color their hair . 
finally ,  not as much mother as i expected . 
it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features . 
the shell easily peels off and inside is a thin ,  wrapped chew . 
i m sticking with the canon digital cameras for now on . 
if you are a power user ,  they just don t cut it . 
noise factor is about the same for both brands . 
i bought these for my glock num_num gen num_extend
these types of foods do not give dogs the protein they need . 
i love the way this hat looked in the pic . 
i called nature s best as well as now foods . 
it comes with num_num blocks but only num_num really fits inside the fish . 
it doesn t even look like the one in your picture . 
you cannot change up emblems in the middle of a chapter . 
the original wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game . 
within num_num minutes of the bath ,  he was scratching again . 
otherwise ,  i m sticking to glass containers from now on . 
i ve been wearing size num_num for over num_num years . 
a year ago i took yerba prime and it worked really well . 
very inexpensive wadcutter pellets of about num_extend grains weight . 
i have to give this a lower rating for lack of durability . 
this toy grocery cart trolley was a huge disappointment . 
we thought they worked great ,  although he kept pulling them off . 
warning :  do not use this as a shaving cream . 
if your dog doesn t mind the smell ,  it might be fine . 
these blades got dull very quick and barely cut anymore . 
this happened only the second time i used this blender . 
when i open the box ,  one of the clip is missing . 
this actually hurt my armpit and left red marks . 
if you like the first halo get this game . 
they have ruined what was a great sock . 
maybe my son will want to mow with it . 
i will not use this formula ever again . 
i spent over two weeks using this everyday and saw no difference . 
nordic ware dropped the ball on quality control with this pan . 
the process is no where near as  forgiving  as traditional nail polish . 
dogs walk too close to each they don t like it . 
i got the ryu book and it told me . 
after about num_num months my battery started to decline . 
i have a few others from elsewhere that don t do it . 
this product is clearly loaded with black food coloring . 
this tripod is made of very cheap materials . 
if it says more protein and not % whole grain . 
i agree with the noise  ,  it freaks my birds out too . 
a wobbly bar is almost worse than no bar at all . 
there is no way i would ever buy this again . 
the big deal about this grill is its portability . 
you cannot even shoot when you want to . 
which is kind of the reason i threw the remote in frusteration . 
i purchased this for my husband because he was bed ridden . 
i screwed up my first cover by pulling off the plastic too soon . 
i ve had these before and we loved them . 
there are only a few games to be had . 
but a measly bottle of shampoo ?  go figure . ok . 
then ,  you get to do it all over again . 
it s now back at sam s club in the reject pile . 
youpretty much just shoot ,  shoot ,  and shoot some more . 
i m wondering if i am not understanding something with this game . 
so i have a whole bottle and i wont be using it . 
like the saying goes ,   there s no such thing as bad chocolate  . 
will get you a drive letter ,  but sometimes it s a task . 
every time a call comes in i have to manually select this device . 
put your money into something with better engineering such as the aor . 
it is nothing like the soft claiborne wallet . 
expect to replace them with a new set soon . 
all you do here is just tap the circles at proper timing . 
they just now started working on the inner fleece . 
i even took my polish off ,  hoping that would help . 
that makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers . 
if i use slight pressure i can actually rub it off . 
then it never held a charge on a brand new system . 
i hope this review helps for future purchases . 
even with the extra brush set i bought . 
they taste nothing like the fine indian food i enjoy eating out . 
it bothers bunny and he wants nothing to do with it . 
i expected great results from the wahl healthy infusions pro straightener . 
the parts were rough and didn t line up exactly for proper use . 
what a sleazy way to sell an item . 
as it is ,  this newer model is pretty useless . 
taste fine but just a pain to fill over and over . 
does a better job with the zucchini but still not perfect . 
the front piece pressed too hard on the screen keeping the sensors activated . 
maybe they don t know what to make of it . 
i anticipated their being good ,  and bought a few packs . 
about num_num months later the watch stopped running . 
my dog went through num_num balls in less than a week . 
they were so tangled after i finished it was shocking . 
they sent the masque and not the wash . 
sorry but its not worth the taste in my opinion . 
this  game  was all work with no fun . 
keeps slipping a bit off side of fridge !  . 
however these newer ones are now made in china . 
i have seen no improvement in the thickness or the length . 
thank god ,  we made it to the beach before a disaster struck . 
for $ you can get pro studio monitors . 
they are remarkable here in being virtually nonexistant . 
this haribo is a great price so i tried it . 
i like their urine destroyer product ,  it has worked well for me . 
i do not know how it happened but this is over all cheap . 
the protective cover is aggravating to say the least . 
i was first told the unit would be returned repaired on num_num oct num_extend
did not notice any pleasant affects from the drops . 
the stickers on the cube are wrinkled so the pictures are skewed . 
hopefully this new version has the wheel sensor problem addressed . 
he likes them both and eats them with out any issue . 
however ,  this prowhite brush head is my least favorite . 
i do a lot of driving ,  and deliveries . these are cheap . 
i was wrong ,  i played this ,  and skyrim once . 
however i am a believer that not everything works for everybody . 
unfortunately ,  this didn t stop her biting and licking at all . 
the system is not difficult ,  but sluggish and cheap . 
the car is difficult to get onto the tracks . 
lashes did not adhere very well at all . 
would not even transmit a full num_num feet . 
because i ve already used the bag ,  i can t return it . 
do not pay more than num_num or num_num bucks for this game . 
at first when i saw the product i thought it looked great . 
now it is stuck at num_num and won t clear . 
this cover is adorable ,  but you get what you pay for . 
this product has causes seizures and death in pets . 
blue ant wants to charge $ for two replacement ear gels . 
they do not just snap on and off . 
first noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem . 
so the chances you ll feel dizzy are highly likely . 
i got this to replace battery on my iphone num_extend
the bags do not compare to other brands in the jumbo size category . 
i like the idea of freeing up my stove top . 
so why include that hole it s asmall annoyance but kind of perplexing . 
the common sorts of things to break are only a couple of bucks . 
but yeah ,  it didn t make me break out . 
unfortunately ,  it did not do anything for me . 
well ,  i looked around for the horse but found nothing . 
the blade literally bent num_num degrees  see photo i uploaded  . 
the sony sounds worse than any radio i ve ever owned . 
the buttons on this thing do not make sense . 
it is not for what it is advertised . 
these are the shortest lived shoes i ve ever owned . 
it was just a good ,  solid ,  average adventure game . 
thirdly ,  it did nothing to improve the appearance of my skin . 
the actual center protector sheet isn t as thick as it should be . 
yuck !  kellogg s has some very good cereals at reasonable prices . 
not being able to finish off the ginger ,  tells you something . 
i bought this perfume about a year ago and absolutely hated it . 
weeks later ,  i dropped it on the kitchen floor . 
when it comes to dog food ,  all protein is not created equal . 
i hoped it would save a tooth cleaning . 
so we use it for her to be lazy in . 
this one did not do as great as the others . 
and the belt wont fit around me anyway . 
i live in a household with two cats . 
which is the only good thing i can say about the game . 
frankly i don t understand the hype about these toys . 
i got num_extend they all do the same thing . 
if its not working for someone with normal breakouts . 
and worse ,  they do not even state the ingredients anywhere . 
i will continue with my current strategy . these are going back . 
i won t be using this product any more . 
the pieces of wood are uneven and not strong . 
i think i should have gone with the medium . 
i feel like i m choking the whole time . 
doesn t taste too great and got old super fast . 
i have taken it religiously num_extend day with meals ,  and nada . 
very disappointed since i actually didnt get the product that is pictured here . 
i recommend the brand if you lime the added bulk . 
also ,  the volume buttons and the silent button are difficult to use . 
i has never failed in about num_num months . 
this in my opinion is a rip off sort of . 
the cat will not go near it after a couple days . 
it does not taste like pumpkin or spice . 
i have changed my rating from num_num stars to num_extend
i added water and told myself i would clean it today . 
this is a very basic first aid product for a small office . 
i am not impressed at all with this product . 
i am another customer unlucky enough to have receive a lemon . 
then told me to ship them back and he would ship a replacement . 
luckily i didn t waste money on that additional time . 
when i first purchased the littermaid ,  i was pleased . 
the pricing is good only relative to competitors . 
even my sons yellow lab would not eat them . 
i saw no benefit to using this scrub . 
it works and it doesn t eat up batteries . 
i figured as much as he loves fishing he would love this toy . 
i do not recommenced buying this to anyone . 
i took these every day and did not notice any difference . 
i was really disappointed by this product after all these glowing reports . 
well this is another pair to throw in my headphone drawer . 
the ginger odor is highly evident the minute you open the packet . 
i am totally ashamed of amazon for offrering these packets . 
for the price it s hard to argue with this headset . 
i followed the instructions for stove top and it turned out horrible . 
the rubber bumper part is so thin its barely there . 
the fighting ,  though interesting at first ,  was monotonous . 
in fact ,  i couldn t keep it on without constantly adjusting it . 
just lock your phone and u should be fine . 
the diameter of the rod is approximately num_extend measured with calipers . 
then you can uninstall and use as a coaster ,  an expensive coaster . 
i coninue to buy dingo ,  just not these minis . 
this game is nothing more than an object for ridicule and destruction . 
they should look at turok :  evolution for help with that . 
i ll never buy them or anything like them again . 
the line of travel is mostly limited to one hallway . 
i like cannisters for stair cleaning and bare floor to carpet transistions . 
i expected alot more from lenmar ,  this was a huge disappointment . 
again not happy with the application at this time . 
good idea but does not function as advertised . 
i ll add that the unit is pretty num_extend
this itiem is terrible plenty of back ground noise and static . 
i ordered this from amazon and received it in january . 
the only thing they enjoyed about it was the ball . 
i am not sure what the problem is . 
they were too short on wrist ,  so they felt tight and uncomfortable . 
everything about this game is bad ,  real bad . 
most likely failed quality control units sold here . beware of shill reviews . 
i didnt feel full before the meal and even after . 
all it does is absorb the extra oil floating inside . 
i decided to power through and let is dry totally . 
in my opinion the flavoring should be subtle and compliment the coffee . 
the material is not soft velour as described either . 
i wanted to like this thing  the jabra stone  . 
the controls aren t responsive and the whole game feels rushed . 
i gave it to my son to try on his glock . 
will never order this brand again !  not worth the trouble . 
and scan disc crashed during the process . more resets . 
i wasted quite a bit of money ,  but had to try . 
i recently bought the regular mouth and it is a pain to use . 
i would venture to say num_num sizes off . 
it was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem . 
after tightening it a bit more ,  i checked again . 
the aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die . 
you get what you pay for !  dont be cheap . 
and i will come back to it and play it again . 
production of spirulina requires water soluble forms of phosphorus and nitrogen . 
i then ordered it on amazon and it arrived ahead of time . 
can t remember the last time i had a headache . 
if you want a game for older gamers ,  try rollercoaster tycoon . 
after a few trials ,  she says that she needs to check further . 
i usually wear large and i ordered large . 
i bet square thought of this whole game in one day . 
yes there is no fructose but what about the other ingredients . 
it isn t too bulky or heavy even though it is rather large . 
once you got everything in the wallet to big and bulkie . 
red faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars . 
let me start out by warning potential buyers . 
this game is truly a work of art . 
that s the only reason why i given this product one star . 
it s not very snug against the phone either . 
i am looking for the plain toaster now and will donate this one . 
this is the first time they ve become ill from it . 
i have sensative skin and couldn t use this product . 
the material on the palms wore out to the point of holes . 
i tried this system on num_num different occasions . 
this was just too big for my daschund . 
i ended up selling it at a garage sale for $
i stopped putting it on my face because it consistently gave me pimples . 
it s basically impossible to give the sheath a good inside cleaning . 
i previously praised this product for its protein content ,  vitamins and taste . 
these look the same but they aren t solid like the old ones . 
so your getting both beat and shot to death . 
also it looked kind of awkward in my head . 
this case makes your expensive iphone look like a cheap . 
i bought the card and took it on an international trip . 
not such a great deal for me afterall . 
if you like salty foods then this is well salted for you already . 
this case wouldnt protect your phone from anything . 
the controls for this game are extremely hard to get used to . 
you can t even tell where the enemy is half the time . 
i will let you know if this size change works . 
device  which was introduced six months before that at $
the difference in magnification is pretty much negligible . 
the top cover is so loose that you can lift it off completely . 
get ready to restart a lot of races . 
if i were you i would settle with doom num_num or even wolfenstien . 
also ,  these are rock hard and liable to crack teeth . 
i have used this for over num_extend years . 
it gave body but no lift and hold . 
so far i cannot tell that this product helps joint pain . 
i added hot sauce but the beans were not soft . 
i m asian but my hair is still not very thick . 
you don t need added agave and all the other nonsense . 
worth paying more for something that will last . 
don t even waste your money !  the material is thin . 
now the cable is attached to it with electrical tape . 
stick with what you have until they have a real fix . 
haven t been able to reuse a concentrator yet . 
at freeway speeds i have to really concentrate to hear . 
i didn t care for its dryer texture or bitter taste . 
but if you want to feel comfortable ,  forget it . 
i got the red and it looks true to the one shown . 
it came quickly but sadly the handle isn t attached . 
will be donating the remainder of the case to the shelter . 
so overall the product was horrible and no one should purchase it . 
we even put it in the washer and dryer . 
the plan was to use it for my waterline . 
they are tips and very disappointed with the purchase . 
not what its made out to be alot of stupid funny bad guys . 
terrible terrible terrible  !  !  people will wanna smell younger . 
everything the baby lay on could never be left out . 
definently no hwere near as good as thel ast two but exceptional . 
the philips sonicare advance series is a piece of junk . 
both lasted less than a year and they both had intermittent failures . 
it defeats the purpose while sleeping as it comes out then too . 
it made my head itchy where the strap pressed down on my hair . 
lol this crap systematically broke as used it . 
i bought this bone for our num_num month old schnoodle . 
i guess some people will like them i did not . 
this game sucks and i actually played it for a while . 
 then again ,  i never did really like ts s  . 
they are classic . edit :  they fell apart after approximately num_num week . 
the spot welds on the top tier are very ,  very weak . 
you may end up getting a terrific shave from it . 
i purchased this based upon the quality reputation of sony products . 
they leave a sharp mark on my face where the glasses were sitting . 
if like me ,  you don t ,  then you won t . 
fyi i have been using this for about num_num weeks . 
the game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content . 
using the usual hard plastic scoops found in the local store was difficult . 
at least these didn t cost me too much  :   . 
i thought i was getting a secure cat window sill . 
well ,  it didn t turn out to be what i expected . 
gently squeezed out the water and let the swimsuit dry atop the dryer . 
i am very disappointed with the lids for these jars . 
i bought it for my num_num months old maltese . 
vile filth that made me want to gag . 
had kind of a chemically taste ,  like cleanser . 
so the markup on this product has got to be high . 
there is no learning curve at all for a beginning learner . 
i am returning it for a full refund . 
was not impressed with the case after i started using it . 
the graphics are pretty much the same as the getaway . 
i wouldn t waste my time on this product . 
the only plus is its portable design but that s it . 
like they are silver and someone just polished it . 
i ve put other items and food and they still don t care . 
i always had a second charged battery with me . 
tracfone support is useless  and generally only marginally speaks english  . 
we have been using this product for quite a few months . 
now i have num_num bags to figure out what to do with . 
some of these parts are really cheap and practically useless . 
it is not something i will purchase again . 
each one had a problem but all shared a displeasing smell . 
really ,  save your money ,  unless you can get this dirt cheap . 
 where did we go wrong ?   they would ask themselves . 
i bought this chain for my num_num speed mountain bike . 
my kids like to play with it on the floor . 
i m pretty sure i ve played with this more than he has . 
i swapped out the batteries with fresh ones ,  but no dice . 
i do judge a perfume by its packaging . 
so ,  i decided to return for a refund . 
if you use it indoors make sure you have every other thing covered . 
so not sure how to correct that problem . 
cody tore it apart in less than num_num minutes . 
i love barleans version of a chocolate green drink . 
you are better off freezing a freezer bag with water . 
they have a newer version that works much better . 
asian ladybugs also eat the larvae of native ladybugs . 
updatei hate leaving this update to the good review i left previously . 
i bought this because it had so many good reviews on here . 
the cake was darker in color on both the top and bottom . 
i tried bending them with marginal success . don t buy these . 
it landed on the bottom corner and the case just split open . 
i ve had plenty of phones and plenty of cases . 
that seemed to work for one day and the problem is back again . 
when i saw the conair dispenser ,  i had to have one . 
fairly quiet but doesn t heat well at all . 
i ve found silicone cookers are a better option for nuking eggs . 
this product comes with a cd called  resource cd version num_extend
i have doubt that these are actually oem htc cords . 
the usb ports do not charge all brands . 
there is no way you are zipping up this bag with one num_extend
is this sid meiers work ?  coulda fooled me . 
same result ,  even though i used a bit of butter . 
i didn t bother to return it :  price was quite low . 
be careful with this product it is not for everyone !  . 
well you definitely get what you pay for . 
he has always worn num_extend and the other pair he got fit well . 
if you have a round bowl ,  i recommend you continue shopping . 
with the three compartments it does not work hanging the towels there . 
num_extend has num_num servings and thins one only num_num servings . 
they have the same seasoning and just as strong . 
the speaker ,  home ,  and action buttons were all broken . 
my dogs would chew on them endlessly ,  but then i realized something . 
i am truly upset it doesn t live up to the citizen reputation . 
 as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept . 
i am debating returning the unit and buying something else . 
went back to my wired mouse iv had for ever . 
scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine . 
i probably won t be using this lotion again for this price . 
i will say that the washed out pictures did look very sharp . 
the next day ,  i had some breakouts on my chest . 
i have asked num_num dermatologist about this lotion . 
this applies to the shipping firmware num_extend and the newer firmware num_extend
unfortunately ,  they didn t know the manufacturer had changed the product formula . 
did i mention fred durst sucks ?  i d rather have icp . 
very poorly made ,  save you money and look elsewhere . 
deceptive marketing strategies ,  with the different labels and same ingredients . 
computer will not pick up signal from transmitter . 
not a crisp clear sound like they claim . 
he was cute ,  but i still couldn t fall for it . 
it s off now but the bottle is really sticky . 
just go to your local beauty store or sally . 
what you actually get now is just the tools and no holder . 
this means these towels do not come in any packaging . 
interestingly i have another full set of wustof on my butcher block . 
i bought this for my num_num year old daughter who mouths everything . 
eventually ,  dirt and dust got under that edge . 
we tried it ,  but also wanted to be honest !  . 
i saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome . 
what is the titanium dioxide for ?  why ,  color . 
it is almost the exact same thing as jak and daxter . 
the others are too small which is as cet says . 
every wall was a swirling mainframe ,  every corridor was a sculpted masterpiece . 
nothing against this product it is exactly as described . 
bought this product with high hopes that were quickly dashed . 
this toy is not even a justt ok quality . 
it was as expected and cute and my girlfriend loved it . 
we tried to clear it but nothing seemed to work . 
the flowers are more like little hoses than sprinklers . 
the item description does indicate which your buying . 
i swear !  the voice acting in this game is very crappy . 
since when was there an american in a british comando unit . 
makes you really wonder about how cheap this thing really num_extend
there is very little flavor despite being packed with my different ingredients . 
i may end up gluing it in place . 
these are quite flimsy and develop rust spots extremely easily . 
i had to throw it out this morning . 
i have been to busy to call the company and ask about this . 
dont buy dont buy dont not buy this item . 
i bought two trendnet wireless pci card for my windows num_num num_extend pcs . 
i feel this was a waste of time and money . 
this toy lasted great for the first few months . 
i hope that it will work a bit more efficiently than this type . 
needless to say ,  most don t work after a year . 
trying it on ,  upon arrival ,  was enough for me . 
ordered for my wife last year ,  they were exactly what is pictured . 
i wish i would have read the reviews before hand . 
i loaded my credit card information to test the unit . 
yeah ,  this worked great for about num_num hours . 
highly recommended . it has been six months since i purchased this item . 
a much more clear and detailed photo should be provided . 
i usually wear large and i ordered large . 
cooking regularly for the dog isn t a life goal yet . 
i have used these timers since february  now april  on a daily basis . 
you can use those in about an hour . 
hogue is good quality ,  this one just doesn t fit the glock num_extend
the cream felt fine ,  but it had a slightly unpleasant odor . 
i bought this for my dogs who were having skin allergy issues . 
i must say the cutscenes were good ,  but that s it . 
i know paid eighteen bucks for hot pink tape . 
twelvesouth supposedly has a warranty ,  so i contacted them for a replacement . 
if you order this item you need to watch your size requirement . 
i have a smaller one of these but this one warped immediately . 
it does not have enough of the epa ,  dha ,  and astaxathin . 
i m an adult who enjoys a lot of  m  rated games . 
the concept is understandable ,  but the purpose is not . 
the one pro is that yes ,  it does pact relatively flat . 
it arrived with bent and broken ends on the straw . 
this baking dish works very well until it cracks . 
this never happened with the vga cable that came with the monitor . 
i have used bottle color before and have never had this happen . 
it might look pretty but title is misleading . 
it took some pretty amazing photos during that time . 
the cups are really small so i had to pay to return it . 
would not recommend unless you want to replace every year . 
see a boss off in the distance :  talk to the pc . 
i guess i didn t have an understanding of the product . 
it clumps ,  it smells ,  it never comes off . 
this cranium game is in a pile awaiting our next garage sale . 
the quality was low with the stitching being weak . 
what i did get to play of the game was fun . 
this product actually made my hair less curly . 
i thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected . 
the overall design is good ,  but the manufacturing appears to be lacking . 
if this worked properly i would probably pass out . 
i ve had this phone almost num_num months now . 
they could not have cut more corners making this if they tried . 
for a company called  educational insights  this is disappointing . 
but i wouldn t reccomend it for slicing potatoes or carrots !  . 
there are better argan oil treatments out there . 
nothing else has ever done that in my washer . 
i like the convenient pump bottle ,  but that s about it . 
she is no longer able to walk long distances as my boy is . 
i found myself once againputting in halo to cleanse myself of that garbage . 
no big change in rinkes in fact no change at all . 
they arrived quickly but did not work properly . 
you have to click to where you want to go . 
my other son s watch started doing it also within a few weeks . 
works perfectly play game in standard mode and works perfectly . 
very disappointed ,  and i hate to write a negative review . 
then made another purchase at cables to go . 
however ,  they are cloth with cotton stuffing or batting fill . 
but that thing about the bed ?  well ,  it s so true . 
you can t just merely control alt delete and restart sonic stage . 
maybe about % of the time it doesn t write . 
and all things considered num_num stars is generous . 
it was christmas morning and my daughter opened up her gift . 
the new printer worked very well ,  for several days . 
same exact speakers ,  same exact result ,  wow what a disappointment . 
i bought this to clear heavy nicotine stains from my white furniture . 
not sure exactly what happens but the balls cease to make noise . 
they also cut out when i am walking . 
how is this possible on that low calorie diet . 
but i don t buy a dedicated germination kit . 
when i recieved it the charger had a short in it . 
this spray stuff was a terrible option for me . 
as a result ,  the flea trap is of no use to me . 
first off ,  this did increase the battery of my phone significantly . 
i have had it a week and already scratches are appearing . 
it s edge is too thick to pick up crumbs properly . 
the toy didn t work out of the box . 
yes i hear the beep ,  and yet still it doesnt work . 
i have other brands that do this well with no problems . 
i think consoles are the way to go . 
tech support finally told me it wasn t compatible with my printer . 
she said it was so beautiful i had to try . 
eventually the logo stopped showing and it was nothing . 
;  unfortunately ,  innards are already being strewn as well . 
it doesnt strenghten my nails ,  if anything it made it worse . 
the advertisement states that it is better that nonstick . 
i would be happy to spend more for solid stuff . 
lucasarts may as well sell boxes stuffed with crap . 
i mean ,  this is a very strong scent .

thought i d try these as my brows are blond and patchy . 
if you haven t experienced how bad it is ,  consider yourself lucky . 
i thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days . 
the valterra is much easier on batteries too .

i was on the system for num_num months . 
i was not happy with the fit and felt right off . 
i was very excited to find this product . 
i bought these to accompany my crossman num_extend
i hate emu oil ,  it is not for me . 
as of november num_extend the item is lost . 
this was ripped up in less then an hour by my weim . 
their are bad games , but this is just crazy . 
the resolve seems to work good for these particular messes . 
not sure a bigger size would be better . 
case is nice but ben franklins face is scratched . 
really difficult to use and won t stay in hair . 
they will explode in the microwave on occasion . 
i wish they would have made it more stronger . 
despite my scientific training ,  you really have me on this one . 
she has plenty of weapons to use against the evil vampires . 
and the size is quite big for such a tiny lackluster battery . 
yoyos are supposed to go down and up . 
i ll echo the sentiments of all the other reviewers here . 
so after this bottle runs out i will not be buying it again . 
i think i would only eat this again if i was starving . 
where do they come up with these games . 
makes swg a sad place devoid of skill in combat . 
there is one that took me num_num hours to beat . 
you could buy it or not its up to you !  . 
however i had no problem getting a return label or my money refunded . 
making an internet connection is next to impossible . 
very disappointing as the rest of the wallet seems to be very nice . 
i ordered num_num sports bras in num_num c . 
also ,  batteries last only a few weeks at best . 
this bar was a let down in comparison to the chocolate raspberry version . 
i do not recall how the tab broke off . 
sometimes it would turn on ,  and other times it would not . 
the heart rate digits should be in a bolder font . 
they re my size ,  but they are too tight and uncomfortable . 
this rack just does not have wide enough spacing . 
the clips are not the worst ever ,  but they are a pain . 
but almost too much of a pain to work with . 
these are garbage ,  save yourself the aggravation and buy something better . 
it lasted a couple days and had to be thrown out . 
our breads that we put in it molded . 
this made my holster come right o f f my belt . 
no more will i opt for the cheapest priced item . 
besides those down falls it works good for what it is . 
should have returned in during the warranty period . 
great facade within lousy performance !  skips from disk num_extend
this digitizer looks great ,  and came in a nice package . 
so i was able to see a larger white light . 
i don t want to develop cancer from calphalon you know . 
it also worked okay for digging under clover on bare soil . 
the belt clip shattered into millions of pieces . 
first ,  the poles of the tent were sticky .

you know ,  something like deus ex ,  or mass effect . 
i thought these gloves would be ideal for my problem . 
the second highest was grand theft auto for num_num memory . 
i am still on the search for a good pair of tweezers !  . 
there are limited choices for extra dry skin from what i can see . 
we bought one of these and played with it for num_num day . 
i have followed all the directions and this doesn t help our dog . 
i bought this multiquick hand blender in june of last year . 
want to stand up ?  hit v to go from prone to crouch . 
i was never able to get the device to communicate with the router . 
whoever thought this up never owned a dog . 
and this was happening without me even using the fm stereo option . 
i would say this is a horrible but expensive excuse for mascara . 
this is more like frosted flakes now with some raisins thrown in . 
i remember getting hydro thunder when it first came out on sega dreamcast . 
i ve had good success with my existing routine . 
my dog then skinned all the tennis ball fuzz off . 
i would highly recommend trying the demo first before buying the game . 
after that ,  they barely charged and would barely hold any power . 
it doesn t seem like they have a replacement . 
now we re off tho start the return process . 
i used to use the elf defining eye brush for everything . 
well ,  it lasted maybe num_num months before my phone started randomly rebooting . 
just google jelly belly coupons before you go to the web site . 
i used it for a while ,  and didn t notice any difference . 
it has kind of a funny feel and balance . 
don t make the same mistake i did though . 
smell is gone ,  but only after other methods . 
and this is after having eaten dinner and lots of water and milk . 
this rice bran oil is not made from  california rice bran  . 
this watch looks really slick and i liked it a lot . 
he said there must be some questionable ingredients within cetaphil cleanser . 
otherwise it is alright and looks nice installed on my wall . 
i cannot recommend this product as it fails on multiple levels . 
this and the associated clear balance product get good reviews . 
i would not purchase another case like this one in the future . 
the face wash leaves my skin feeling irritated and totally dry . 
not like the ones i buy in the store . 
i m really not a fan of this car mount . 
my son has so far refused every one of these flavors . 
in a whole different perspective ,  with three dimensions on the battlefield . 
this is when it is fully charged too . 
it does function but concerned quality of pictures are suffering . 
recently i lent it to someone and it broke . 
i stopped taking it and threw it away . 
we use them as a floor towel in the bathroom now !  . 
take a look at the reviews  written before mine  to judge for yourself . 
i should have just did this in the beginning . 
give them a comp and all of a sudden the speech sounds normal . 
we were both taking num_num pill am one at night . 
not to mention it s not at all convenient . 
save your money and buy a different case . 
stay away from it .  .  . awful game awful game awful game . 
cute toy but just didn t work for my cat . 
my wife liked the look of the wine strap . 
after hours of troubleshooting ,  i finally got it working again . 
it s a little disappointing but i expected that as well . 
so if you get this cover get a different color . 
mega bass is  just ok  but could be better . 
possibly the problems i ve noted have been corrected . 
this was the worst fighting game on the snes system . 
socks too large and bulky for a woman  in the foot  . 
the unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective . 
this product arrived completely disassembled sans any directions whatsoever . 
i would not even recomend renting this game . 
my daughter begged for this forever and finally i got it for her . 
over all the game play of this game is not bad . 
the item i received was a dried out ,  empty container . 
the screen protector has kinda a weird surface . 
i have had these for about a year . 
yes ,  as everyone says ,  it is solid brass . 
i will be buying a belt style leash to replace this dangerous one . 
thought this might have been because the wiper arm itself was bent . 
the crumbs are hard to remove as well ,  even after vigerous banging . 
received in the mail quickly; however ,  the case was too small . 
i bought this because it was only $
this should have been shipped with some sort of padding . 
i ll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation . 
no amount of labeling can prepare anyone for this num_extend
sounds easy and it mostly is but it gets old fast . 
see no improvement in the puppy ,  but as it s dysplasia . 
my num_num dachshunds love most of cesar s dog food . 
she loves dora so we just had to get this . 
well the cards are not recognized by the leapster . 
i m going to get a different model next time . 
but honestly hand washing did not help how uncomfortable they were . 
i was given a container of this product as a gift . 
my dogs used to love these when they were chicken  strips  . 
i should have known ,  seeing the main ingredient as glucose syrup . 
you can save a few bucks and take your chances . 
get a nice french press or stovetop espresso maker instead . 
i received this one last week ,  it s for my home setup . 
when the monopod is extended some ,  it is quite wobbly with my num_extend
i been wearing this perfume for years ,  i know my ed hardy . 
it just doesn t slice it for me and is quite uncomfortable . 
after two days in the hospital ,  we brought our baby home . 
silent hill in space and just about as annoying . 
i have purchased several different styles of cases for my phone . 
this is greasy and does not sink into skin like shea butter should . 
most burr grinders at even half the price do a better job . 
i would recommend strobe cream or strobe liquid from mac . 
the hot spot spay works better than this . 
i dont think this eye primer works very well . 
or as one reviewer suggested ,  try to buy locally . 
when i think wusthof i think top of the line . 
it seems like you either love or hate this antenna . 
i have other diffusers and they work just fine . 
you can t even really put anything in it at all . 
again ,  deceptive marketing to misleading the consumer user experience with false expectations . 
we used the leaky side as a holder between wash and wipe . 
i ended up buying another dust mop for light dusting of the floors . 
most combs  including the rid and this one  just have straight prongs . 
i got bored after num_num minutes of play . 
these fit ,  but material protrudes in the most unflattering way . 
these were bought as undershirts under work shirts . 
after the battle you have to run from the creature through a ship . 
however ,  my cats did not find it interesting at all . 
i originally gave this a num_num or num_num star rating . 
poor to no ergonomic design when in to this . 
even a good price doesnt save this bad product . 
it hurt my ears ,  it hurt my head . 
i m surprised that this product received so many good reviews . 
my son ends up getting overstimulated and throwing the toy . 
some apps allow keyboard to use in wider landscape mode . 
coffee ,  i have one ,  and it froths like a charm . 
now it s so damaged i have to cut the damaged parts out . 
i almost got hit in the eye with flying kernels . 
it allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another . 
i bought this due to positive reviews but never again . 
it was really disappointing and felt like the game was hastily thrown together . 
instead ,  buy the combination of joby gorillapod with belkin liveaction camera grip . 
piano ,  guitar ,  vocals; anything that require midrange response is left out . 
the brush and container are great ,  arrived quickly . 
i use the sony batteries without any issues . 
this toy has a great potential if the quality will be improved . 
you won t regret it if you enjoy  thinking man s shooters .   . 
the wind would knock one side down and it would start draining . 
you get num_num calories from one num_extend ounce can . 
i got the  ten and under  bargain bin version . 
especially considering that a bottle lasts awhile . tropical coconut smells good . 
which is nice if all you want to add is water . 
pretty boring and disappointing for the $ or so i paid for it . 
i had to wash my case to get rid of the awful smell . 
i have num_num cats ,  all are indoor animals . 
in sum ,  it was a waste of money . 
so long steve jobs and your great phone . 
i never got the motivation to do it . 
this thing seriously would cause me to wreck my car . 
dunkin donuts house decaf is for me the gold standard in this category . 
the main problem ,  though ,  is that the product is not durable . 
other than that i was delivered really fast . 
these are soft plastic ,  and i know people said they were short . 
i would not recommend this product for energy . 
but they made the game slow ,  excessively difficult ,  and bland . 
i ordered the mint color and i receive an ugly baby blue . 
do yourself a favor and don t buy this . 
these beef stick were so greasy that i threw them out . 
this is to be added in sitting water . 
in this game i have gone entire seasons without double digit penalties . 
thought i had found the ultimate garlic press . 
at this point the phone doesn t make any sound . 
no one can afford to swallow down that many supplements a day . 
quality is good and what you would expect from crayola . 
our dog is only num_num lbs ,  but she is solidly built . 
but it was the only one they had at the store . 
awful sound and the camera is still the games big problem . 
i bought the original recipe treats here because the premium was too expensive . 
i use the dermolagica primer and it is wonderful . 
my daughter begged for this in the store . 
i have just used this rice cooker for the first time . 
my cat falls into the latter category . live and learn .

i got a $ generic stylus that works % better . 
i bought the toothpaste and there were some weird green fibers in there . 
and as an added bonus ,  the clean water tank has started leaking . 
i ve really enjoyed my moving comfort bras  i mostly have junos  . 
there are so many phone covers out there these days to choose from . 
maybe you ll feel better about it than i did . 
i have to keep removing and replacing the batteries for it to work . 
try l oreal s million lashes or cover girl s clump crusher instead . 
this product was obviously developed for women and small framed men . 
i wanted the normal cut around the ankle ,  not bell bottoms . 
i have had better luck with my black and decker citrus juicer . 
this mixer broke after num_num months of light use . 
this cadet dog treat is listed as made in the usa . 
sorry to say something bad about nordic ware . 
doc gave me antibiotics ,  and a pain prescription . 
you will be surprised how light theses stairs are . 
these oysters taste good ,  no question ,  but cottonseed oil is unhealthful . 
my vhs quality was back where it used to be again . 
steam tells you when you can play or not . 
i sprinkled this around some areas that we ve been having ant problems . 
a large was way too small for me . 
this was just some nice add ons and tweaking . 
even without the sugar ,  it s plenty sweet  without being too sweet  . 
she took down my address and said she would escalate the case . 
i got this because it looked like a nice overnight bag . 
extensive experimentation could not yield good rice results . 
bread maker and they have all been great . 
my kid is num_num and i played one time with him . 
if they were priced closer to $ then i would approve . 
i thought for $ it would atleast work . 
neither of my kids ever really played with this toy . 
i bought this bore snake a few days ago . 
the slightest distance away and it might as well be invisable . 
company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this . 
i washed it with fabric softner and still not good and still itchy . 
even the simplest of manufacturing tests would have caught the defects . 
i had the same difficulty with the second unit . 
i am not buying any more teflon products . 
the  authorized repair  center in new jersey should be shut down . 
do not ,  under any circumstances ,  buy this game . 
we recently tried one of these out at a friends house . 
i paid about $ for this turntable one year ago . 
i will give to my daughter for her car . 
$ it should have been num_extend  with num_extend shipping  . 
my biggest beef with gta num_num is that it is incredibly boring . 
i had high hopes for this based on other reviews . 
the seller was great and quick at getting it to me . 
i even tried wrapping them aroung a pencil . 
i have a jeep liberty so dont have that much dash board . 
the gun itself is hilariously cheap ,  poorly made and frankly ugly . 
it is difficult to fix in place and it is unstable . 
i plugged them into my backup light num_num and they did work . 
amazon allowed me to return it for the correct size . 
the did a really poor job on the features . 
if any of this sounds exaggerated ,  do some research . 
the first test of the blender was to make chopped ice . 
i purchased this because i was concerned about my cats water intake . 
tried in the num_num cars of my house just in case . 
i did the directions but used a smaller amount . 
there is a little piece of foam only on one side . 
xl just wouldn t fit on me at all . 
i m num_extend and num_extend and the small size should have fit better . 
i bought this as a birthday gift for a num_num year old . 
the blocks and the strap are good just not the mat . 
positive training with just treats seemed to work better for him . 
it s worse than those crappy rated t shooter games . 
again my fault need to read description more . 
these are not comparable to crocs in quality . 
i tried running this on num_num different gaming computers that i have . 
this does not fit the num_extend qt purchased from costco . 
you constantly do the same thing which is . 
this case looks plastic and makes my iphone look cheap . 
calls break up badly and not way to solve the issue . 
the actual whisk part is not tall enough  only num_num inches  . 
i ordered two bands ,  one for myself and one as a gift . 
the plot in this one is unbelievably dumb . 
i can t sit on it for very long . 
the filter against the fence to get the dirt out . 
ontop of it you just have few templates and cosmetic choices to apply . 
safety is the issue ,  and they were not concerned about that . 
the best ive been getting is from doing consistant water changes . 
but the treats were soft and did not appear to have gone bad . 
i can hear those i call really well . 
i won t recommend buying this pot even if it is cheap . 
i started freaking that the water was bad . 
and you would think that buying more would reduce shipping . 
i can t seem to find both in one item . 
much too dry ,  almost tastes like little rolled up pieces of paper . 
but the bag is pretty big to go on the handle bars . 
finally decided to order a batch and give  em a try . 
for $ i expect the darn thing to be useable . 
worst fire ant killer ever bought in entire life . 
aaa home furniture discounts lacks integrity should be avoided at all costs . 
kraft could ve used type num_num or num_num plastic instead . 
into it . as it turns out ,  this was a good thing . 
they should have saved some research money for the speaker . 
i got a different brand that does not have the background noise . 
the leather is not of great quality for the steep price . 
these are quite uncomfortable in between the toes . 
these feel more like plastic than a chew treat . 
i rate it num_num star because it is too tight . 
my daughter does like the little ice cube tray . 
when i pour ,  the brew plops everywhere but in the glass . 
sled storm for the num_extend is a huge disappointment . 
well ,  these fit the fatter me but i felt fat in them . 
i m going to order a different brand instead of now brand . 
then call of duty num_num for xbox num_extend
they are also not made very well with stray strings sticking out everywhere . 
as expected ,  the color s similiar to opi my private jet . 
this screen is so thick you can t utilize the touch screen . 
they asked me to provide the lot number and expiration date . 
the result is that pressing the buttons takes a lot of force . 
press punch once and you ll swing spawn s axe . 
tried getting used to the controls but just couldnt do it . 
gillette doesn t want folks to get a bad first impression . 
the taste is completely different and not for the better . 
i had to use another shampoo to get rid of the oily feeling . 
it is hard to apply and it cakes on your skin . 
the backpack is much smaller than it appears to be in the picture . 
i tucked it down in the tray ,  i pulled it up . 
and this nail file is just okay ,  not great . 
but sadly i won t be ordering from this seller again . 
i don t think there really is a difference . 
i discontinued the use of this stuff immediately . 
then you have about num_num guys shooting at you from all sides . 
this one doesn t hold any better a charge as the old battery . 
the pieces are small and so is the completed puzzle . 
should have read the reviews carefully before buying . 
i love the old sim city games ,  especially num_extend
my newest treasure from amazon came this morning about num_extend am ,  early . 
i find this type of adapter to be very handy . 
second one went to the trash on day num_extend
what did i expect for less than $
some things ain t what they used to be . 
maybe you can poison someones water supply with it . 
my tea of choice is earl gray and i put honey in it . 
also ,  the mint is so strong it burned . 
things are often very relative in the gaming world . 
i put it in my bathroom wndow when showering . 
the click of the trigger switch is louder than the bell itself . 
will never be buying things from overseas ever again . 
don t buy this product or any electronic devices online . 
i tried cleaning the blades multiple times and nothing worked . 
the otterbox commuter case fits much more cleanly and offers a similar profile . 
my cat has barely looked at this thing . 
he is also shedding again like a beast . 
i bought this thinking it seemed too good to be true . 
when she used it ,  the whole game codes erased it self . 
it was like rubbing coffee grounds on my face . 
for a tennis shoe ,  but never for a work boot . 
sooo much smaller then i thought and the clasp was loose on one . 
but this snack is pretty hard to bite . 
so i just have to throw them out . 
he is crazy about the taste of the product . 
when i went back to fs ,  all those issues went away . 
i read system requirement and compare different bands and chose this one . 
tried to play a couple of times before i gave up . 
the first few times i did this it took a good two hours . 
the holes for charger plug to pass through are not the proper size . 
there are far better lanyards out there and for not much extra money . 
i will say at lease it was warm . 
turns out that one of the ingredients in izze is  natural flavor  . 
the earphone jack has no problem at all accomodating my earphones . 
they re very heavy and are nicely finished as well . 
i was looking forward to trying this coffee . 
rival would take care of any problems after num_num days . 
i paid $ at a gun show for this . 
she had no explanation for my reaction ,  unfortunately . 
on top of that setting the alert temperature is a real pain . 
i ve used other brands in the past and had no problem . 
i finished it on the hardest setting in num_num hours . 
little investment and little hassle if you feel the need to return it . 
too bad it didn t last one whole day . 
guess i ll just go for num_extend or something . 
that s the only good thing about this bra . 
save yourself the aggravation and avoid this item !  !  . 
everything is in num_extend and makes it look great . 
i had such high hopes for superman returns . 
i pealed off the entire side very easily . 
not crazy about the scent either .  . will not buy again . 
it cost to much to send them back . 
in particular ,  i got sick of the pirates on the first island . 
levels are way to small and game play isn t very exciting . 
looking at the ingredients list ,  it shouldn t surprise . 
if i m not mistaken this company is creating  edited  . 
i prefer the texture and taste of the kal flakes . 
i think ea sports has sunk it s ship with this one . 
my skin was soft and smooth when i got done without feeling greasy . 
it doesnt provide much cushion for your hand either . 
the range of adjustment of the device once mounted is too limited . 
it s a sleek looking case but not protecting . 
i was very disappointed when i finally received this product . 
google this and you will see other people having this issue . 
we were spitting over the side of the landing within seconds . 
i had to fiddle with the nude socks throughout the work day . 
the rest of the pant fits great ,  everywhere . 
i will probably not buy this type again . 
the triforce hunt is the only annoying and tedious part of that game . 
i bought it based on sennheiser s rep and reviews . 
those guys got their degrees in a box of cereal . 
sorry ,  this game sucks from an rpg stance . 
i read all the reviews on this product . 
a few other people had said this but i ignored and ordered anyway . 
it started working ok then every few days something would go wrong . 
this game is boring because it s all the same . 
there s a reason why these drives have one year warranties . 
this may be a european vs ,  american distinction in the style . 
i tried it in other outlets but no luck . 
i did not like the flow of the game or it s style . 
i just need to press a button to light . 
we usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup . 
then on the umpteenth attempt it suddenly worked . 
one of the pieces was broken ,  and the pieces are quite small . 
they don t roll around as you move the sticks . 
if you missed something important ,  you just can t go back . 
looks more like num_num gems in a tiny num_num inch wheel . 
we all have our own tastes in perfumes . 
sending them back to amazon would amount to nothing . 
i was horrified as no one had every said anything about that possibility . 
i had high hopes for this product ,  but no luck !  . 
this is a poor excuse for a demo derby game . 
no honey flavor and a very weak corn flavor . 
i am returning this stoller because of the defects and ordering another one . 
something like this really should last at least a year or more . 
the ocelot s definitely helped reduce ,  but not eliminate ,  the numbness . 
my other main gripe is the swimming controls . 
soon you ve got a floppy liner and elastic bands attached to nothing . 
it doesn t take up much storage space either . 
then ,  after a while ,  i discovered an option called  secret factor  . 
for the money and tuff scale i was hoping for more durability . 
these  frownies  wont stay on ,  no matter what hype the company says . 
of course ,  this does not prevent the unit from working . 
all num_num of us actually spit it out . 
i own a disher that matches the item on the zeroll site . 
don t even waste your time on this junk heap of worthlessness . 
it will pull out clump after clump ,  no matter what you do . 
this is totally horrible and isn t worth picking up for num_num bucks . 
my cat is a beast i should ve known better . 
i was extremely disappointed because this product was pricey . 
my old eureka boss was substantially better  and substantially cheaper  . 
here is some things that were not mentioned in other review . 
i tried to use this charging my samsung note num_num and motorola photon . 
the smell does not last for more than half an hour . 
this toy is awkward to pick up for me . 
there is no way to remove it once the installation is complete . 
not as good as i had been getting in my local groceries . 
the cotton pad gets caught on the face . 
even coming out of the box it was so bad . 
ordered two extra for my sons double eagle num_extend
you can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue . 
this liquid bandage is no replacement for the real deal . 
i will use these speakers until the other speaker blows out . 
to me they had less support and were very hard . 
i put the battery in my phone and it keeps restarting for num_extend
the instructions on back do not indicate which removable film to remove first . 
while this basic filter ,  does physically protect your lens for cheap . 
the only gripe i have about the game is an effective counter system . 
you will spend hours falling because the camera and controls . 
i have large wrists and this looks very small on me . 
my right ear still clogged and hurting from trying . 
it makes me wonder where this case was stored . 
this game was made like the developers were drunk or in a hurry . 
so i know a thing or two about mouse traps . 
performance may be !  but reliable ,  i don t think so . 
i could not finish this drink ,  it is like drinking orange syrup . 
had a cheap plastic feeder that the hummingbirds went nuts over . 
i purchased this when i still was using a dsi . 
i bought this product because one of my friend is using it . 
since it didnt work the first time i used it . 
playing this game on the computer is a pain and a half . 
received this as a gift last christmas num_extend months ago  . 
so far i am not at all happy . 
a stipple brush is an excellent way of applying a heavily pigmented blush . 
this stuff has no distinguishable flavor to it ,  just a stagnant sweetness . 
but for right now ,  i am not impressed with the gameplay . 
there is no padding to use it as a compter num_extend
all i can say is that i hope it will be good . 
i would buy if knew it made in europe . 
this is designed to hang off your belt . 
they may be archaic but they always work . 
they ve loosened up over time and are more comfortable . 
the color had a reddish tone which didn t suit me at all . 
the picture shows purple and when i got it ,  it was burgeundy . 
without a doubt the worst popcorn i have encountered in many years . 
it was not a strong coffee but the cinnamon roll was really nasty . 
amazon was kind enough to refund my money and i trashed it . 
nevertheless ,  despite this shortcoming ,  the graphics themselves are excellent . 
i d rather have slightly lower audio qulity but both sides working . 
this is ok lip balm ,  but nothing special . 
based on this experience we are switching back to tripplite isobar . 
the flavor is odd  elderberry flavored cranberry pieces  . 
i went to the dermatologist when i realized that i wasnt healing well . 
a tee shirt provides as much support as this bra . 
these are very flimsy ,  the flowers detach very easily . 
but there is the rub ,  it still does stick . 
what i received was a legit knockoff from hong kong . 
they should lower the price and take away the chain . 
i thought i could use this to cast spells and such but no . 
so the warranty expired a long time ago . 
one of our neighbor using a unknown name router with security on . 
the paint chipped as soon as the brush fell of the handle . 
this is the only game i cannot play with my config . 
this polish holder arrived cracked ,  to the point where it was unusable . 
nice read color warped slightly after washing on top rack of dishwasher . 
just got this thing and it is wretched . 
i purchased this phone as a gift for my now num_num year old . 
i plan to color my hair after this . 
but recently my dog has been having problems with his skin . 
some don t . it s all about what works for you . 
after i unlocked everything i bought virtua fighter num_num and this became obsolete . 
this hat was not quite what i expected . 
the first day we had it we played with it which he loves . 
i bought a pack of these and a pack of the plastic bolts . 
combining these two is smart and a great combination . 
i am so disappointed in this product line . 
by the way i bought packet which include mouisturizer and facial foam . 
i have had larger ,  older ,  rival pots last for years . 
it ran for a week and then died . 
the cushion slides around ,  and thin ,  hardly a cushion at all . 
which btw i will be writing a review on that game as well . 
these test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use . 
the same style makes for a non stop bore fest . 
bought the wrong size and had to return the product . 
the bottom is wide enough to attach sync cable while driving . 
i simply couldn t get it to work ,  at all . 
and narrowly avoided cursing at least num_num times . 
i think that the sound quality of the supplied earphones is pretty lousy . 
after that i was careful not to move it ,  at all . 
this is not at all what i thought i was ordering . 
just let the screen scroll and move the player around a little . 
this is the second type of led light i have tested . 
that player does not have the num_extend which is fine with me . 
linksys still hasn t done a thing about the streaming media bug . 
so i tried it and it seems like it should cost about $
now i remember why i got rid of it in the first place . 
i high suggest you skip this piece of junk . 
just press num_extend over and over and over . 
i suppose you get what you pay for . 
but it should at least color my whites ,  right ?  nope . 
wife did not care for this product at all . 
it s a good thing i m sitting instead of jogging . 
the one i grew up with would go blazing fast . 
have to recharge phone num_num or num_num times a day . 
i regret spending the few bucks on it that i did . 
so i bought this and i don t see any difference . 
so ,  now i am picking up cat poop beside the litter box . 
now ,  i can give the tea an extra star !  . 
but everyone who describes the flimsy handle is right . 
i would not even really want it in my house . 
personally ,  i feel it is ineffective and frankly ,  overpriced . 
boring !  this game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise . 
the lid sticks half way on and then it won t move . 
also the mechanism to tighten the strap is very poorly designed . 
it s a nice idea ,  but does not work very well . 
the charger part disconnects fairly easy and doesnt charge that well . 
it smells num_extend worse but it doesnt work nearly as well . 
this might be fine for less strong chewers ,  but my num_num lb . 
 when i bought the krups ,  amazon was not selling the capresso . 
i don t understand why that s possible for  wrought iron  . 
especially because it interacts with so many other medications . 
promptly returned to store . avoid this and save syourself headache . 
he sat right on it ,  and then got right off . 
there is a flaw with the cable however . 
this is the most poorly fitting case i ve ever owned . 
had to add and mix in other curry mix to make it better . 
ives products for years and i ve come to trust their products . 
i ve owned this dyson for a couple of years . 
i purchased several of these ,  and all have gone bad . 
multiple washes later it still leave black lint on my forehead . 
i loved this charger until it stopped charging the batteries . 
i loaded the newest firmmare whenever it became available . 
in num_num and num_extend at least num_num individuals in the u . s . 
they work with me ,  instead of against me . 
i checked that the transmitter s antenna was completely extended . 
not sure what the deal is but be careful !  . 
makes it tough to insert and remove from one s pocket . 
i m not really an energy drink type of guy . 
this is a really great idea for a toy . 
she used it mainly in her room on carpet . 
one while stirring oatmeal ,  the other while cutting a hotdog . 
some individuls love yohimbe but it did not do much for me . 
for a short period of time it worked just fine . 
once i changed my probiotics then i saw great improvemnets . 
my cats love sitting in the window sunning themselves . 
this coffee smells great but it is like drinking flavored water . 
the back of the shoe is a bit fuzzy . 
the five left from the package are in the garbage . 
the clear water level is easy to see . 
does it work ?  yes ,  water drains easily through it . 
they have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them . 
back magic plus does a better job for me . 
after approximately two and half years ,  tossing them in the garbage . 
i take it off when i m wiping it down . 
i tried this the first night that i received it . 
the parachord handle is not paracord its just a piece of string . 
kid just not in to this game very much . 
i bought this product because of the great reviews . 
i guess that s really why warehouse deals reduced the price . 
there are more but they re neither interesting nor fun to watch . 
what a piece of crap !  do not waste your money . 
a game that is too easy is not fun either . 
this game leaves you with a hollow ,  pointless feeling . 
you do feel the tighness ,  but that is all it does . 
dealing with their customer service representatives was horrible . 
i admit that i am not far at all into this game . 
i think it is something wrong with these vitamins for sure . 
and it feels more like bee s stinging you than heat . 
and its not fun you have to play as hummans to unlock dragons . 
i m not entirely sold on the benefits of this milk formula . 
that corner of the case is now permanently scuffed and visibly cracked . 
i would not purchase this product on my own . 
also rotating the levels num_num degrees caused them to show drastically different reading . 
they gave me different insoles to try ,  adjusted the laces ,  etc . 
but honestly why should you have to do that . 
after the first week ,  i only noticed the tiredness increasing . 
this really find nothing but dry out my skin . 
these are probably the most comfortable bluetooth headphones . 
i m not much for lemon or hot drinks like tea anyway . 
but kept them because think they are a safer alternitive . 
i definetly wouldn t buy olay cleansing cloths again . 
but for me ,  if it s too loud ,  it s useless . 
i now appear to be stuck with a hit and miss cd changer . 
it ensures the zero and full throttle ranges are set . 
this model is too short and the feet fall off . 
i sent in the required form ,  serial number ,  etc . 
this item frequently gives blood pressure readings such as :  num_num over num_extend
so so so badly designed . the unit also does make noise . 
if you re looking for a product with flavor ,  skip this one . 
it flattened me entirely and wouldn t even hook latch . 
wait until you get the replacement before you return your broken bowls . 
product worked great ,  connection was easy and they sounded wonderful . 
save you money these are not worth it . 
the resue shelter recommended this ,  but it doesn t work . 
i prepared our meal and added this extra for more flavor . 
but there are much better  and less expensive  products out there for that . 
replaced with a kitchenaid kettle which has a far louder whistle . 
i think they should put a notice or something on the package . 
wow is about the mechanics of amusing gameplay first and foremost . 
i haven t had any luck with any of the green mountain coffees . 
i was highly optimistic about this plantronics num_extend model . 
we also received one year of online access for each pet . 
it does not fit my iphone num_extend with an otterbox defender case . 
when i looked at the router every light but the power was out . 
thanks to amazon for a painless return process . 
looks nice ,  but is a waste of your money . 
it s hard to get comfortable and i constantly have to adjust it . 
this charger lasted about a week before it gave out . 
the smell is also subtle but still gross . 
the mineral complex is nice ,  my skin felt smooth . 
i cannot maintain a comfortable conversation with somebody while walking down the street . 
even if it were plain black tea ,  it is of inferior quality . 
this is a classic pinball game scaled to fit a coffee table . 
when the coffee people say extra bold they mean it . 
this will be the last time we purchase this . 
my num_num pound dog just could not get any of the treats out . 
if i could give this lower than a num_num star i would . 
hi purchased this ,  and i was so excited to use it . 
i expected more out of this brand and a longer lifespan . 
amazon sent another one next day but it would not properly mate . 
yakima support pointed me to a tech bulletin on this rack . 
unless you like to eat cardboard ,  which i don t . 
honestly i found this game to be kind of boring . 
it made my face red within a few minutes of applying . 
this is a comment about the choice of packets over canisters . 
eventually after communication through various mediums they agreed to send me a replacement . 
here is a case of a great game gone bad to the console . 
but the pump locked up within a few months . 
i ll never buy a panasonic dvd player again . 
i read reviews about that and thought i d take a chance . 
it has some issues that forced me to return it to amazon . 
the engine is pretty much exactly the same . 
it doesn t work num_num times in a row . 
would not purchase these blades or the clipper they are for ever again . 
a call to hornady did not help with these problems . 
i also bought the apple care protection plan . 
i tested the water for particled before and after . 
it will be that way the whole game . 
ah well . i personally believe if you are convinced these will work . 
find a better product and pay a little more . 
the magnet is not that strong and the pole is quite short . 
not to mention assorted filters ,  batteries ,  flash cards ,  etc . 
the name  gary grigsby  sold this game for me . 
made of plastic ,  thats all i gotta say . 
this thing won t slide on the screen at all . 
it is a bit louder than the num_extend
this is a num_extend not a num_extend magnifying glass . 
don t waste you money on this if you have an iphone num_extend
you re only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the linksys card . 
this thing is painful ,  and annoying to use . 
some quit the first time i tried using them . 
once again ,  i was sadly disappointed with deva . 
not only were they fragile but they barely work at all . 
seriously ,  anything involving digging a hole and concrete is major life commitment . 
if you try to attack guile he does his knee saber thing . 
i do not like this perfume at all . 
i would say that i have about $ invested in it including games . 
i guess you really do get what you pay for . 
anyway ,  i started using the chopping block right after receiving it . 
i can taste the cinnamon ,  i think i taste clove . 
my friend ,  an audio tech ,  did the install . 
unfortunately she wanted nothing to do with it . 
however ,  they don t make these the same way they used to . 
i guess i should have looked up what it was num_extend farther than . 
it chops quite a bit better than the more expensive ka chopper . 
then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell . 
i tried the suggested modification from other posters but this made no difference . 
save your money and don t buy this cheese fest of a game . 
any who ,  these are much thinner than regular lasagne noodles . 
just a low quality design with the material used . 
this product just did not work for me . 
both are less expensive ,  work excellent and have great moisture !  . 
i ve learned my lesson and stay away from linksys now . 
if anyone i knew had dry hair ,  i d definitely recommend this . 
ok ,  the thing does hold num_num cups as promised . 
with arms  ,  i would give it num_num stars . 
limitations often include the need to manually focus your lens . 
the only % effective boxer briefs that i have are the exoffico type . 
oh how i do adore the taste of bacon . 
i love knorr products ,  but this one was a huge dissapointment . 
yes ,  it looks great but it is really no fun at all . 
i was hoping to get something that was much bigger and much sturdy . 
the face of the phone is fully exposed . 
i try fast forward and the thing goes to the next book . 
i bought two sets of these num_extend oz and num_num oz  in july . 
i have tested it by switching foods on them . 
the machine tries but is too weak to push , lift and dump . 
i was excited when i first started playing this game . 
if you want to use this card ,  you need a new reader . 
i personally will never buy another game from bethesda again . 
remove the plate ,  and you have unfinished drywall showing  the cutout  . 
if anyone gets any effect it s not from the drops . 
i got these in a small and could barely breathe in them . 
it tasted like i was drinking a fruit concentrate that needed diluting . 
none of my bands would fit this tool . 
they still bark as much as they ever did . 
i mailed it back  and had to pay shipping for the return  . 
i came home to diarrhea all over my home . 
we all agreed it was not easy to keep straight when firing . 
very pretty but not if i cannot wear them . 
it feels more like  sacred  with num_extend graphics . 
we ve used the traditional littermaid boxes for over a decade . 
each of those circles of color are maybe the size of a dime . 
all on the area that the bristles are is green with mositure . 
looked good until i tasted the first sip . 
the steam basket that rests above the rice bowl works very well . 
right from the start he started having problems with it . 
they were fine for about one week and they stopped working completely . 
once that s done ,  it s on to cleaning the refrigerator . 
again ,  i understand why my babies wouldn t eat babyfood . 
these did not work well for me at all . 
i checked the cable and nowhere on it does it actually say belkin . 
braun s are great quality but grossly over priced . 
but ,  a look at the ingredients shows that it is garbage . 
i finished the bottle and felt zero positive effects . 
i would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax . 
i also had to wait a month before i received the case . 
i guess they work but not the nicest machining . 
i would advise spending twice the money on something four times better . 
if you like really dark chocolate ,  these may be worth a try . 
i am used to unscented products but nothing like this . 
i left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket . 
but it was sweet ,  sparkly ,  and had a nice bite . 
the last one functioned for six months before just dying . 
i had this heater only briefly because of it s high noise level . 
but not at all worth the money for me . 
at num_num months ,  she still had no interest in it . 
i tried hard to like this game but it s just too boring . 
the num_extend will at least give you good call quality . 
and yet at the end ,  u must make a run for it . 
however ,  i would not recommend to those with even mildy sensitive stomachs . 
after several attempts we decided we won t eat it . 
my cake just didn t want to come out in one piece . 
it was difficult to assemble ,  and damaged upon arrival . 
this stuff makes my face break out a bit . 
i will have a review about this brushes on youtube soon . 
this copy was off maybe num_num percent of the time !  . 
blue buffalo is also grain free and good for dogs with allergies . 
a nylon gear in the steering mechanism stripped after num_num uses . 
was really expensive for no longer than i actually used it . 
surviving the various lengthy dungeons is similar to an endurance test . 
i just want to have fun with this game . 
the case has a thick back and cannot be used with a skin . 
the first time i ordered this it never came . 
very disappointed after reading all the great reviews . 
i already knew that it was the most comfortable device for my ear . 
this is not an owi brand robotic as advertised . 
however ,  for $ i expect more out of my player . 
he was just totally unhelpful and ,  as i said ,  condescending . 
i have had to fix mine with krazy glue ,  tape ,  etc . 
i would steer clear of this phone all together . 
i am an xl and found this jacket very snug . 
some reviews mention that this comes with a battery . 
i really should have looked at the amazon reviews before i bought it . 
i had also given them straight plug adapters . 
i just ordered an apple sync cable instead . 
my one complaint is that it is loud i mean really really loud . 
i sent it into dogtra and they did fix it very quickly . 
by the time i got to the bottom of the num_num lb . 
i thought i d give this one a try . 
so i buy some of these and the box is in perfect shape . 
it protects your screen just as good as the cheaper options out there . 
i put this on mine i needed one anyways . 
since i didn t want a replacement ,  i tossed this one . 
it sounds okay if you don t need fm radio connectivity . 
i now have num_num thermometers that are registering num_num different temperatures . 
the trick system feels extremely linear and leaves no room for experimentation . 
i wished that the leg size was tapered to the bottom cuff . 
i returned this product before i used it . 
three ,  the remote control is not intuitive ,  and is buggy . 
it is a pain in the butt and essentially impossible to enjoy . 
my two girls did not play with this hardly at all . 
this is not how the game should have been . 
i even kept notes on the number of my hot flashes . 
i did not quiet believe it and thought i might be lucky . 
anyways ,  a few buddies and myself went camping at allegany mtns . 
excellent idea but bushnell really fell down on the job with this one . 
i learned several good lessons when ordering the luna bars . 
it worked great for about three months and i was happy with it . 
i have no idea why it picks who it wants to work for . 
the straps for securing a small animal are too large and bulky . 
i would not recommend it for anything but a very small dog . 
the issue that was most annoying was the clip kept popping open . 
so ,  i m glad i didn t pay money for this . 
the plastic part is also not much better than my num_num dollar feeder . 
did everything as instructed but the game never installed . 
it took me between num_num and num_num hours to complete the game . 
it would work with one set of batteries ,  but not another . 
all i see is one small blue line across the entire thing . 
i put the part that the blades sit on onto a window ledge . 
when i contactedmercury ,  they sent me out a new one that fit . 
it s a good idea but take out that piece from inside . 
i have also had some problems with the graphics . 
it was only one and it was red . 
buy cotton from a crafts store and cut your own . 
if i was that shakey i d head for the retirement num_extend
they kept trying to push me into taking it to verizon . 
even at full power ,  the spray is not very strong . 
i had to use my own technique to do this . 
i absolutely could not stand these screen protectors . 
this item is also corded ,  another significant hamstring . 
i also need a massager that included the buttock and thigh areas . 
it is unbearable indoors for any period of time . 
so you notice a little change but never enough . 
i tried the sample before ponying up the cash for a full bottle . 
i bought this item because of the reviews . 
the purchase turned out to be a disaster . 
not as described and a loser for crayola . 
also ,  i had it get stuck on me a few times . 
i attempted it a second time and it was the same thing . 
so i bought a linksys instead and there s a stark difference . 
the smell of this stuff is very ,  very strong . 
games are much harder to produce for num_extend than they are playstation . 
it would fold and bend on itself and dig into my skin . 
i have tried several brands of premium batteries with the same results . 
yet ,  sprint is supposed to have a better num_extend system . 
the toy is cute and hasn t broken  yet  . 
also ,  i recently lost everything i had stored on it . 
i wish someone told me ,  please ,  dont buy this product . 
it sounds good on paper but it didn t work for me . 
also ,  the lens actually fell out of the frame . 
the milk container is so small we refer to it as the creamer . 
i was very disappointed .  .  . it made me feel quite ill . 
it has kind of a greasy oily texture to start with . 
i had gotten better ,  faster temporary results for free . 
the form and fuctionality of the item is fine . 
 i m brutal on my gear ,  hence why i buy maxpedition  . 
without either i don t think i could have done this replacement . 
well ,  the safflower gets jammed in the feeder . 
usb is usb . actually there are two different kinds of usb . 
plus ,  hated that i couldn t simply stop it . 
i think there are other case out there that are better . 
sexy no !  and they are so cheap looking . 
after much thought and research i went with the num_extend
anyone know anything really stronger than say ,  tiger balm ?  . 
the first ones of these i bought worked great . 
they may be a little more but the quality makes them last longer . 
they play with the ball just like any $ pingpong ball . 
more rational ways of dealing with these hazards need to be devised . 
when i lifted the set from the handle the whole thing came apart . 
unit got very hot after a few minutes . 
didn t waste my time mailing back because they were cheap . 
i had a bad flea problem last year after getting a puppy . 
i would return it if it wasn t so much of a hassle . 
nope ,  came out tasting even more cidery than the first num_num batches . 
i owned a little oscar for years and loved it . 
i would definitely recommend the braball over the bra baby . 
my cats had it destroyed in a day . 
the only thing it really does is temporarily matte my face . 
these do not work well and are very cheap . 
in the process the  plug  comes out and all the treats follow . 
if you are looking for very light amethyst earrings ,  these are perfect . 
by the end of the day ,  the hippos were pretty much broken . 
the brushing action also feels more powerful than the old design . 
until they change these charges i recommend going elsewhere . 
i became allergic to peanuts at num_num years old  lucky me  . 
more research led me to understand that this could happen with this product . 
luckily ,  sprint is ordering me a replacement battery . 
this is because of the excess amount of glycocyamine present in the milk . 
they sell what is pictured in the photo . 
not only is it better but its also the arcade version . 
this canister filter is strong ,  the motor hums pretty loudly . 
i already have a straightener that does that . 
the fibers stick to each other and stay stuck . 
she has a cool attitude and very optimistic . 
the next day it was moving around on my counter . 
my skin is not that oily and i live in the desert . 
does work ok as a dash mount when using gps . 
plus hours of walking around looking for turtles which can t hurt you . 
received this product and it was damaged when i received it . 
it also only worked for a couple of months . 
because most of us don t bring screwdrivers when traveling . 
hanes comfortband is much better for this low price range . 
i honestly think this oil is nothing but castor oil . 
mine had about % actual seachem matrix and % similar colored gravel . 
price too good to be true and it was . 
even the texture is off . the expiration date appears to be num_extend
first of all ,  only num_num minute quarters are allowed . 
order your regular size ,  i ordered up and that was a mistake . 
bought num_num of these thinking my cat would love . 
will order another one and hope it comes with all the parts . 
connecting it to the computer with my ipod nano did nothing either . 
essentially ,  what the screen feels like without a protector . 
i m wondering if this stuff is actually toxic . 
what little i could hear was tinny and barely recognizable as music . 
somehow ,  keebler figured out how to make a bad graham cracker . 
i also don t like the smell  no redemption there  . 
the biggest problem is its horribly laggy and incredibly imprecise . 
the cost of that sends it into the garbage pile . 
i purchased these nuts at my local publix in their greenwise section . 
the human eye cannot even tell there is anything on the lashes . 
and do not be upset because my testimonial is truthful . 
i wanted to throw it out then ,  but was too lazy to . 
the material is this cheap grey plaid color under the black . 
i also use them more for fridge storage now and baked goods . 
after one leg fell off ,  i gave up . 
this did not last a day ,  there were purple pieces everywhere . 
this is the third time i have ordered a plantronics product . 
this is by far the worst bra i ve ever tried on . 
i know all the steps ,  tricks and techniques . 
the orginal band on my seiko aquamatic lasted only a few months . 
better than nothing ,  but it doesn t really install clean and easy . 
the blue led light was anoying yet i learned to live with it . 
i cleaned it with new cloth which i got from sunglass hut . 
everything worked on side one; nothing on side two . 
hard to say if i see an improvement after num_num weeks . 
this could be moved by a toe ,  a shoe ,  etc . 
i bought this thinking my curls would be soft but it wasn t . 
on the package ,  it indicates it is for cordless phone use . 
not a huge deal ,  just a personal preference more than num_extend
the silicone was stretched out and the hard cover wouldn t fit properly . 
you can buy it for less than $ with free shipping . 
i noticed that only one side of the mirror is functional . 
my issues with them are the size and hardness of the soles . 
they should be kicked off of amazon for this bullcrap . 
but the overall game is ruined by the horrible graphics . 
i give this winchester knife two stars out of five . 
his sister died within a year and num_num days . 
the website says this clip fits for crossman num_num air rifle . 
i really wish they had regular sit and spins without any musical abilities . 
so i went and bought myself one on amazon . 
but my cat disagreed ,  so the rating is his . 
in fact it made me look smaller and provided no lift . 
i will buy the decaf espresso next time . 
all other bras will at least fit enough to wear . 
we will dump this machine and buy another brand . 
there are just too many things to list . 
and these were at least a size to small . 
i never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything . 
it s about the equivalent of a cheap bathmat ,  but more expensive . 
it gives them awful gas because they cannot digest the corn meal . 
this is the perfect thing for my little thirsty one . 
i paid num_extend for this at a  big lots  type store . 
it gives you num_num gb of more songs for just num_num more dollars . 
it is very interesting to watch it go into every little corner . 
why would i think that way ?  reviews from all over the web . 
updates take num_extend i guess because of symbian capabilities . 
does not taste like what comes out of a cracked coconut at all . 
it wasn t horrible or anything but i won t be buying again . 
encouraged by the consumer reviews and great price ,  i got this pan . 
not to mention that they have sales on the lipcolor periodically . 
doesn t hold the paddle tight and falls off way to easy . 
this bar has num_num calories and num_num from fat . 
i guess they re better than nothing tho for dry firing . 
we bought two and have already thrown them away as they failed . 
 update  my little beagle is too smart for this toy . 
remember jumping down and avoiding those laser beams ?  same thing . 
however ,  this product simply did not meet my expectations for the following num_extend
its been about a month and the chrome plating is already peeling . 
i just received this boden chambord num_num cup ,  num_num oz coffee press . 
i plan on trying suave dry shampoo next . 
for now ,  i was not happy with the knife . 
i think this one needs to go back to the drawing board . 
this filter is not coated ,  and the reflections are awful . 
just whatever you do ,  leave this game on the shelf . 
the connectivity with my other wireless routers was horrible . 
i had these scheduled fora return within num_num minutes of opening them up . 
tried a number of kitchen cleaners and they re still sticky . 
if you have an espresso machine ,  consider another grinder . 
the instructions on this product have to be wrong . 
i returned this headset immediately and got a refund . 
but it was not the case that i ordered . 
no online play ,  ai or damage will mark the gt series  downfall . 
forget the sheath ,  it s crap but it holds it in there . 
i have never had this experience with krupps product . 
there is no inner seal on this product . 
my cat does not like it at all . 
again ,  i would only buy this having prime . 
it does not dissolve in cold milk ,  but floats on the surface . 
i was disappointed ,  to say the least ,  in this product . 
if you value your life buy american jack stands . 
i just now noticed and it s too late to return . 
this year has been a very bad year for fleas . 
do not buy this product until they change vendors . 
i would never buy this again and do not recommend it . 
the first six meals or so smell  bad   spoiled as they are cooking . 
i tried with additional products but my hair always fell flat . 
and then ,  there is not much variety ,  either . 
only things i found tasty were the chocolate and the pistachios . 
its only a small circle for the status light . 
i will continue to use skinceuticals toner and sunscreen but not the cleanser . 
final fantasy tactics is annoying ,  frustrating and unrewarding . 
the only positive is that it is cute . 
i did not like the taste or the consistency . 
the flash is useless outside of num_num feet . 
i tried the cable that came with another charger . 
i burned my ear with this iron the first time out . 
this tinted moisturizer is more like a liquid foundation . 
separate product for undercoat and another for top coat . 
it lasts maybe num_num minutes and it smears like crazy . 
i have tried num_num or num_num different things and none seemed to work . 
the material is on the cheap side and very fragile . 
it has just one fault ,  and that is the zipper . 
it s ability to configure rules leaves much to be desired . 
this contraption latches at the dial ,  which unlatches at the desired time . 
i had ordered this monocular for my dad for fathers day . 
product arrived and ,  right out of the box ,  wasn t working . 
i think a baby might enjoy it better . 
most medium to large cats probably fit the large . 
meanwhile ,  this stuff will go in the garbage . 
again ,  i was completely ignored; not even the courtesy of a reply . 
apparently this is the first game to utilize hd graphics on the num_extend
they should be embarrassed to call it salmon . 
use the blackhead eraser once every two or three days . 
it may function really well ,  but i have no idea . 
not this cheap looking case with cheap material and ugly pink color . 
beyond the first few quests ,  there is no possible way to solo . 
i give white num_num black only the two star rating because of these num_extend
my son  now num_num old  has never given this toy much play time . 
the world to explore is really very empty with nothing to do . 
i m headed to the sink to wash this off . 
i tried everything from lowering the flow of water to fast moving it . 
i tried to reset ,  and every thing else . 
i purchased this item with high expectations based on other reviews . 
you can find a similar item for less money and better quality . 
went back to using this unit and the same problems happened again . 
whether they use it in this exact product makes no difference to me . 
very high quality with a num_num biological value . 
the smell is pleasant and i like the consistency of the product . 
the texture was try and just overall the only flavor was  sweet  . 
the mouse range is too easily interfered by monitors . 
so amazon ,  as usual ,  graciously took it back . 
dryer does not dry my hair well at all . 
this makes it very hard to work with plugged in . 
would be fine ,  if it was num_extend louder . 
who am i kidding ,  they ll be in the free bin !  . 
it seriously felt as if i had poisoned myself . 
safety is important . definitely do not buy this product . 
my cat sniffed this toy and walked away . 
xxx has performed independent laboratory testing which supports the bastyr findings . 
usually its something to do with harry potter or lord of the rings . 
i really did not notice any major difference one way or the other . 
also ,  some pieces were slightly warped and wouldn t lay flat . 
no support for the hdr capability of the iphone num_extend
and there is no way this is unscented . 
but latch it on to a can and it does nothing . 
it made them feel drier for some reason . 
wilton has lost a customer as of now . 
spend an extra buck or two and get a better one . 
i believe i have tried almost every sunless tanning cream under the sun . 
i was hoping they would because they are a healthy choice for treats . 
it was so bad ,  my ob thought i may have puppp . 
one more notice and cleaning and the camera stopped working . 
they still work fine as two separate thermometers . 
the markings along the side don t even match those seen from above . 
i thought this would smell like cookies or sweet . 
the tabs stunk so bad when testing ,  i gave up . 
i hope it works , as this product would not . 
i ve had several upss now for a while . 
to speed up combat they just sped up the game . 
some will like this and some will not . 
i can t speak for any other small critters ,  only rats . 
num_num is a lot better ,  but it s a little overrated . 
it is one of the top fifty chemicals produced worldwide . 
the difference was it cost soo frickin much . 
the esthetician who gave me a facial recommended this serum for my skin . 
it tastes more like a watered down salty broth . 
i didn t notice if it calmed my redness . 
i have a severe squirrel problem around my house . 
it is made cheaply ,  but will hold your rounds . 
this is strictly a toy that makes noise . 
this is a case of you get what you pay for . 
we got this story when our son was a baby . 
needless to say it was impossible to find at the beach . 
i was very surprised to see so many very good reviews . 
not for a grown woman   or someone my height   . 
i charged it for about num_num hours before checking the battery level . 
she figures that it may be completely refreshing then . 
i purchased mgs for gamecube and wish i hadn t . 
it is much easier and more precise to focus manually . 
can you go wrong for $ bucks ,  at most ?  no . 
they re pretty standard and the cinemas are tired and uninspired . 
taking off the pack allowed me to dry off . 
if you don t these will not make you happy . 
i have dropped twice before inadvertantly and never cracked . 
i wonder if sanyo has corrected this problem ?  . 
the cynch straps ran outside the handles and made the handles unusable . 
i did not wear them on the return flight . 
they pop out frequently when you are trying to put them in . 
everything appeared fine until i attempted to boot off the new drive . 
in general i like it better than num_extend
go with a good old little tikes or step num_num cart instead . 
he must smell the leftover treats in there . 
maybe three screens at different angles would do the job . 
one of the clips was broken out of the box . 
jpre is the most unintentionally silliest games i ve ever played . 
this is a very small key chain sized toy with a mechanical squeaker . 
when i used it for the num_extend time ,  it already bent . 
this is very filling ,  but my kids hated it . 
amazon stated that i could reorder it but . 
the unit itself looks and feels cheap as well . 
the seller refuses to correct the description ,  so you ve been warned . 
not worth the extra $ from a fast ethernet switch . 
i can easily sum this product up in one word :  yuck . 
not comfortable the flip flip was very stiff . 
it appears to be a really poorly designed wireless card . 
thinking this was more for her age ,  i got this one . 
it does not cover the screen all the way . 
until people become more skeptical ,  they are right . 
i will never ever again purchase any of these products . 
i finished this game on the difficult setting in num_num hours . 
iphone did work but needed to be charged . 
my cat didn t eat it ,  still eats my pothos instead . 
num_extend off the seller unique imports handled the whole thing fantastic . 
the two main features of the toy are the ramp and the elevator . 
i could hardly see them at any focus adjustment . 
he said it needs to be at num_extend to have a shot . 
try to stretch the metal out and  of course  it just springs back . 
i was surprised that the product couldn t handle this . 
and ,  have lived here for over num_num yrs . 
to be quite honest the game is borring afrter an hour . 
okay ,  so i thought this was a great idea . 
the very first ingredient is ground yellow corn . 
all the good reviews had me hopeful that the product would work . 
so you can never have enough litter in there to clump properly . 
it has a very strong alcoholic odor that burns your eyes and skin . 
the only saving grace is otterbox has excellent customer support . 
this headset adds a thick layer of white noise or something . 
it was harder to comb through ,  and so took unevenly . 
at first it looks like a good idea . 
this device runs out in about twenty to thirty seconds . 
after a very brief period of time ,  the sheet stopped sticking . 
i have owned many marsona white noise machines . 
besides being easy ,  it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics . 
my phone dropped maybe num_num feet on its back . 
let me tell you that this little device is a nightmare with lights . 
i was just holding it and it accidentally turned itself off . 
i have a num_extend num_extend and this game runs slow and clumsy . 
it s too expensive to take the chance though . 
do yourself a favor and do some research before buying this game . 
my feet and legs ached at the end of my shifts . 
i bought this because it was on clearance at my local drugstore . 
today are not your grandmother s pyrex . the original corning inc . 
it sprung an air leak on the nozzle that goes in the tank . 
my friend even commented it looked more red . 
i finally pushed so hard the mill broke . 
hints and tips are handed to you before each battle . 
not all of them are crisp and crunchy . 
while the software does work fine ,  i preferred using iphoto . 
or it would just rip the can label at the top . 
i don t know how they do that ,  but i love it . 
but i thought that should have been in the explanation . 
we have to retrieve this or that package . 
to say it s a total flop with him would be an understatement . 
this game decent at first ,  but then loses its charm . 
usually these kind of lamps also works with lemongrass  citronella  oil . 
all the strings were so intertwined i ended up cutting them off !  . 
otherwise ,  if you are like me ,  you ll feel unchallenged . 
it paused frequently ,  displayed mosaic squares on screen . 
didint bother returning it because it was cheap . 
i saw no results at all with this product . 
these toe separators did not work for me . 
would not reccommend this to an enemy let alone a friend . 
however ,  until then ,  my opinion of this product is that it . 
the knob would then wiggle around in it s setting . 
she ripped the tabs off around the hole opening in a few minutes . 
box was flattened when i received it but the items inside are intact . 
how can this be a num_num star game . 
but it is not truly unlocked as advertised . 
also you have to pay num_extend a month to play it . 
unlike the other reviews ,  i was very disappointed with the game . 
the headset wouldn t fit in my ear and stay . 
i believe the vibrating part of this product is just a gimmick . 
i say get the small bottle and try it !  . 
the case by itself is pretty good for the price . 
i was duped by reviews ,  but in actuality doesn t work well . 
this feels basically like a sports bra with a wire in it . 
num_extend release and they didn t got at least some nice gameplay . 
if you like weak coffee ,  you will like this . 
the quest to find unscented body butter continues . 
my real complaint is the limited utility of the dishes . 
it protects completely ,  doesn t scratch ,  and looks good . 
first down dog ,  my hands wouldnt stay put . 
i was somewhat surprised at the quality of these sticks . 
i got this case wanting protection for my phone . 
sugar is the worse enemy in maintaining good health and a healthy lifestyle . 
unacceptable as the whole purpose of a bottle is to hold liquid . 
it s supposed to exfoliate and get you really clean . 
hope that lasts longer than a few weeks . 
it worked for about num_num months but now is useless . 
the balls are in the penguin and don t fo anything at all . 
not only are they large ,  but they re too pointy . 
i guess nikon is the only way to go . 
you however may live a simpler life and it might work fine . 
my girls prefer toys they can cuddle with or use their imagination . 
i m taking advil and putting aloe vera for the pain . 
but ,  as i stated before ,  look at the price . 
however ,  more often than not ,  it s frustrating for her . 
reported to amazon and got credit for purchase without any hassle . 
it look good on the picture but cheap once you see it . 
i was in a bike shop looking at cages . 
the packaging is way better than the eyeshadow . 
as the old adage goes ,  you get what you pay for . 
i bought this camera new in num_num based on reviews at the time . 
if the commuter case had this ,  it might be num_num stars . 
it was just too big for my cats to play with . 
just use a usb extension cable instead of this device . 
i own the set that only has capital letters and it was fine . 
the grip is horrible and hard on your hands . 
this one won t and in addition ,  it has a terrible taste . 
this wastes num_extend the reamer is held loosely in its frame . 
the cost on amazon for claratin is $ per table . 
not to mention one of the metal grinders is beginning to num_extend
the stones in the ad photo are a deep ,  brilliant purple . 
just bought this litter for my cat a couple of weeks ago . 
i purchased two of them and it s the same problem . 
the zippered opening has flaps that are much too large . 
this is the first puzzle game i ve purchased and it was hard . 
his parents enjoyed it more than he does . 
this stuff is too damaging to use again . 
i almost always buy whole bean and grind myself . 
it would have been a great product if it had larger replacement earpieces . 
the smallest awl also broke ,  and the others were too big . 
but you get what you pay for ,  right ?  . 
i have num_num dogs and foster when needed . 
i didn t have the support expected from a bra . 
i can t imagine why people compare this game to splinter cell . 
can t figure out why it cost so much either . 
this was a christmas gift for my son . 
i ve cleaned it three times now and it hasn t helped . 
everlast apparently isn t the legend of boxing equipment they used to be . 
the propeller does not spin on its own . 
i don t know if i will waste the $ for new beaters . 
he s back to licking up every last bite . 
dont even try to shapen it ,  its a pain in the ass . 
and makes for more uncomfortable wear . and then the design . 
you can go to the website and find them ,  but none included . 
here are the i don t like about num_extend
try another flavor of think thin protein bar . 
if you think this is scary you must ve led a sheltered life . 
maybe others have easier to use vents or something . 
this item should not cost $ $ is more like it . 
sodastream cola is much less weight making it more cost effective to ship . 
the wilson unit produced a noticeable improvement in call quality and dropped num_extend
i think that states how misleading this product really is . 
i hope that they will be easy to install onto the phone . 
it is rectangular ,  not the trapezoidal shape needed by our cameras . 
i ended up buying a cable style cleaning kit from otis instead . 
my experience ,  opened the pack ,  product smelled stale . 
i bought this because it had such high ratings . 
my daughter loves it ,  so we are keeping it . 
the slobber remained floating on top and the dirt laid on the bottom . 
the rendering of a stylized hong kong looks just gorgeous . 
this case has much lower quality than other s shape iphone cases . 
i wish i could give these zero stars if i could . 
many more products like that and i will look to other retailers . 
it s worked as a router supposed to be . 
this product is a very pale paste . refried pinto beans . 
i love these beans and have bought them before . 
one question ?  isn t this the same game as the two towers . 
added more litter and again she was unable to use it . 
i got it and it is so much better than the bialetti . 
even with the guard it was horrid trying too pass the potato through . 
i won t be buying this soup again any time soon . 
i wish i would have read reviews before i wasted my money . 
as a result ,  pyranha bytes ,  the game developer ,  is history . 
i would suggesting giving them before their main meal so they are hungry . 
there is also a stabilizer which can be added . 
or maybe qcs there are all snow blinded ?  . 
beating up on orcs and skeletons gets kind of dull after a while . 
however when we received this package all the chalk was broken . 
this thing cant get above num_num stars probly cus the shipping was fast . 
i m highly disappointed and ,  to be honest ,  pretty upset . 
i dont by any means beat on it . 
the orcs are different and have different features . 
this was our first and last nancy drew . 
the first num_num and the num_extend were both new from verizon . 
these things peel after some time and never last . 
i am a big fan of fit flop sandals . 
this is an expensive solution to protecting your door from chipping . 
will be returning and begin again the search for yoga pants . 
i basically got bored of this game and it does get frustrating . 
great for blending brows and getting rid of mascara num_extend
we enjoy a taste of tai s peanut noodles . 
i never bothered trying them again because of the bad first experience . 
put it in the dishwasher once and it will rust . 
num_extend look on the side of the carton beneath the package contents listing . 
they had a difficult time putting them on . 
i thought  ,  maybe i need work on the precision of measurement . 
it requires complex logic to determine a hidden code inside the treasure chest . 
these turned out to be worthless to me and a waste of money . 
it also was my last . i just purchased a different conair product . 
not sturdy enough for the bulldogs to play with . 
but if you press ever so slightly to one side ,  it does . 
so that power bricks will not really work well with it . 
too bad ,  because it has a nice look overall . 
so i ended up just recycling the nice bottles . 
i agree with several other reviewers about this product . 
if it was $ it would deserve num_num star . 
bascially this is a rental and not a good rental at that . 
when it was used though ,  it showed you everything . 
buy this for the child of someone you would like to drive crazy . 
well ,  i ve learned my lesson on kong small dog squeaker toys . 
i laughed out loud when i opened it . 
so my complaint is aimed solely at the product itself . 
maybe i m expecting too much out of this game . 
i purchased another with the hope that this problem will not repeat itself . 
but i cannot figure out why it is rated so highly . 
i wouldn t dare pay the num_num i saw it for today . 
maybe this is just me but i prefer a more high speed feel . 
i d like to purchase many more but won t . 
ea has proven they are bad for gamers . 
now i ve figured out the reset button doesn t actually do anything . 
for one thing ,  the game is way too dark . 
the operating system saw the device right away ,  and it worked flawlessly . 
we ve replaced the num_extend and same error again . 
i got the num_extend model which has the glass bowl . 
in this case it contains maltitol which is a sugar alcohol . 
if it sounds too good to be true ,  it probably is !  . 
it was not working so that it solved my initial problem  coverage  . 
not worth the money; poor quality ,  too lightweight . 
after using this product that place filled in with new lashes . 
i am not sure how one gets steam without boiling water . 
it was sealed by plastic and there was a seal under the lid . 
well ,  to put it bluntly ,  i think that they re gross . 
i bought two of these units about a year ago . 
the filter part of this french press is poorly designed . 
they were preparing apples to go into a dehydrator . 
they actually smelled like laundry detergent  talking tide etc . 
also ,  when i put them on ,  they are off balance . 
i will throw it away because it is my only choice . 
don t use this if you re in a hurry . 
i ended up rubbing habds and arms on a paper towel . 
it states that to save on paper ,  the instructions are online . 
i tried other seeds but they just rotted . 
good idea in theory ,  but product development needs work . 
i cannot choke this down and plain is even worse . 
i then smelled and tasted it and i couldn t blame her . 
i bought this game because people said its better than ssx . 
i got about five months of use from this . 
bought this to test the water in my marine aquarium . 
the smell is horrible ,  like stinky old tobacco . 
it is used as a thickening or emulsifying . 
what s wrong then ?  well ,  for starters ,  the weapons stink . 
as with every other discman ,  num_extend player ,  etc . 
however ,  animals could have been harmed in the making . 
it is nothing like the cord that came with my phone . 
way too big and not flattering at all . 
this bag is priced so cheap because that s exactly what it is . 
frankly ,  i d rather go replay colony wars or starfox or elite . 
i use it as described and notice no visible difference . 
the battery was in less than two weeks and quit . 
untrustworthy seller ,  i would recommend purchasing straight from vans company website . 
that is where the game ends for most people . 
this was a toy my husband was really excited about for our daughter . 
these dishes ,  first of all ,  are just beautiful . 
also ,  this thing is huge for the back of the neck . 
shipped in about a week and a half . 
it s pretty much exactly what the title says :  day of reckoning num_extend
i was impressed with the quality and the fit . 
look ,  this thing is great ,  when it works . 
they were only the regular energizer batteries but this was ridiculous . 
magically ,  replacing my trusty  if allegedly slower  sandisk cards rectifies all problems . 
update june num_extend num_extend i was initially happy with this product . 
i am not sure i would order this product again . 
don t waste your money ,  except as a  collectible  type item . 
wish i was able to find these in a retail store . 
i was disappointed because the winding feature would not work . 
the belt is a good width  thick at num_extend inches  . 
they still prefer the toy breed formula than this one . 
it was a great color  purple  for the puppy we rescued . 
i will probably cut it up for shims and other uses . 
this is not near as good as first . 
aside from being pricey online ,  the cartons are poorly designed . 
it wasn t always handy to have a timer near us . 
a lot of this had to do with the boring weaponry and enemies . 
i tried adding heel cushions ,  but that didn t help . 
sorry biore  ,  for me ,  these strips were a flop . 
this was a waste of money for me . 
amazon replied quickly and got me a refund very swiftly . 
my num_num year old daughter wanted this for christmas . 
one for my car ,  one for my husband s . 
update :  the key tumbler mechanism seized at work . 
also ur body can only take in num_extend
buy something more dependable or go to the jeweler !  . 
even the packaging is generic  . all it says . 
will not fir with even the slimmest case on . 
i can say these have worked for my ankle boots . 
i ordered a num_extend and this is in no way a num_extend
bought a few of these based on the rating and features . 
this unit was a little flimsy when i installed it . 
i m not going there .  . these are going in the trash . 
it s a pain to see in an office setting or outside . 
i set all three alarms and can t hear them . 
i ve never had a reaction to lactose that was half that intense . 
it is also significantly less powerful than the unit i am replacing . 
thank goodness i only paid $ for it . 
if you hang up the pot the glass lid falls off . 
i urge anyone considering this game to try it before purchasing it . 
also ,  the fingerprint paper doesn t lend itself well to crayons . 
it does not last long ,  the smell is gone within an hour . 
i have owned this cuisinart waffle maker for going on num_num years . 
as a side note ,  i also have num_num cats . 
i bought this product on because of a recommendation on the dr . 
after a season ,  i had to replace it . 
it was going to be their big present christmas morning . 
the vibrations ,  in my opinion ,  don t do a thing . 
not so much !  each tablet is wrapped in plastic . 
i try different brands all the time and look for the following num_extend
i actually would like to use one product from st . 
i did not spread it thin and i followed the instructions . 
it s going back on the slow boat to china . 
i wouldn t recommend this shirt for anything other than sleeping in . 
but it is really too small even for an num_num lb dog . 
i ve owned other otterbox cases in the past . 
i somehow managed to push myself through num_num chapters of this game . 
finally ,  the grind button on ours decided to fall inside the case . 
it takes quite a bit to turn my stomach . 
a bad brush head now and then but not whole packages . 
this products caused a white hazed on my glass cooktop . 
the cable works great and makes everything look amazing . 
i d say there is a serious quality control problem with this frother . 
level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs ,  scorpions ,  and worms . 
so i don t care to be friendly about it . 
replaced an older model kitchenaid that i couldn t find anymore . 
my corgi tore this apart in about num_num minutes . 
this product didn t really help me at all . 
night and day difference between my  tire tread find  . 
after a couple of days of use ,  my skin started breaking out . 
in the meantime ,  i am back to a broom and dustpan . 
now here is the big disappointment; amazon does not sell nutrabulk s product . 
i ve used it on my daughter who has curly flyaway hair . 
i ll have to dig my lansky kit out to fix them now . 
maybe i got a bad batch ,  but buyer beware . 
but for something as expensive as this ,  i expected better quality . 
my hair was still frizzy and felt like it was dead . 
very tight fit for my glock num_num num_num cal . 
you can spray alot on and it lasts for maybe a hour . 
never been disappointed in melissa and doug products but this purchase i am . 
i don t even want this on my body . 
this did not work for them at all . 
it s become an effective decoy when i feed the fish . 
it cuts or breaks hairs making them impossible to remove . 
i won t buy this or the rotor again . 
i couldn t get my foot even partway into them . 
i have had this charger for one week . 
definitely did not give me a texturized look . 
i purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers . 
anyway ,  he exchanged them for a new pair . 
i emailed the vendor directly and received no response . 
they do stain ,  and they don t blow well . 
i cannot get good bass response from these as a result . 
had perchused one of these num_num years ago in a combo pack . 
not much bigger than a sheet of paper . 
if there s crab meat here ,  i didn t find any . 
for a lefty like me ,  it really ,  really sucks . 
if you buy it somewhere else then i would recommend the bowl . 
the fabric and color were nice ,  but definitely not my style . 
too hard of controls and tons of gore . 
but they sound nothing like what they are supposed to sound like . 
i had a few rashes that went away the day after . 
this was one of the worst switches that i have bought . 
i am returning the shoes today for i ll full refund . 
the idea is good ,  but the design needs some work . 
the blood pressure monitor does not stay together . we will be returning . 
but for my pills ,  that isn t an issue . 
sending this to goodwill and got one with the blades . 
this case fits perfectly on the iphone num_extend
it arrived on time; but this case is very fragile . 
will buy a different brand ,  with round handles . 
they outsource it ,  to who knows maybe a company in china . 
this thing developed a leak the very first time i used it . 
we would have done much better getting legos instead of this . 
save your money and get a better brand . 
to play this game you have to let steam take over your computer . 
causes loose teeth ,  then you need dental surgeries . 
i have used meltdown in the past and liked it . 
i definitely should have gotten one with a  warm  setting . 
we have a very small kitchen so thats no fun . 
yet my skin continued to get worse for num_num weeks . 
the crust mixture was the same and from the same batch . 
but that s if you really use everything here ,  like support cards . 
when it just isn t convenient to carry around the board . 
it s a better fashion accessory than it is a gaming console . 
i think this was my favorite gift this christmas . 
hard to use because it keeps falling out of your ear . 
the flavor was medicinal tasting ,  not very palatable . 
do not place anywhere where it can rain on it . 
if someone wants to give it you ,  refuse it . 
i think it s a great idea that needs some more work . 
save yourself from a headache ,  don t buy these markers . 
it s nearly impossble to beat without a guide book . 
did not work as well as others i have tried . 
personally i was heavily bored and disillusioned by age of mythology . 
secondly ,  the phone isnt working after just a few weeks . 
when you awake ,  you are in a completely foreign environment . 
this is not a ggod case for your evo . 
maybe my set was defective ,  but it s not worth returning . 
but save your money if your pet has bad allergies . 
i see no difference at all in the area around my eyes . 
i blew out the back tire because the liner cut into the tube . 
i use it on my long haired maltipoos . 
i see many people complained about the same . 
i was impressed with the customer service at first . 
the arms are too wide to fit in a num_num speed chain . 
i have not used this polish for just a french tip . 
it immediately went to num_num and sounded the alarm . 
loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product . 
my son got this as a christmas gift this last christmas  he s num_extend
i bought this to cook my num_num lb thanksgiving turkey . 
and i got real tired of the stupid puzzles . 
unfortunately ,  the game just reeks of bad quality . 
fortunately ,  the rush num_num has rigid and insulating materials . 
tore easily around the straps after not even one season of use . 
the fit is quite tight but with patient adjustment can be made acceptable . 
i found that it is more like a shirt than a dress . 
i bought into all the hype the reviewers were giving . 
nothing fun about playing with really hard rice krispies . 
ismooth for the iphone is a much better choice . 
now i have to go over it again to clean the haze off . 
i am unhappy that i cannot return this product . 
since that is why i bought it for . 
other than that ,  it does the trick for now . 
don t bother if you wants these spoons to actually play music . 
i caught what seemed a taste of an artificial sweetener . 
i had such huge expectations for this game . 
they ruined one of my favorit pairs of earrings . 
this drink doesn t taste anything like fruit punch . 
moved all the furniture and put it together . 
i was surprised at how many moths it trapped . 
the only one that did came from wireless hub ,  brooklyn ,  ny . 
there s also a special power the character can use on himself . 
so the bad guy was able to escape unharmed . 
it is not one piece of wood but num_extend
another potential buyer turned away because of this . 
i was able to use it only twice . 
there is no commentary and there are no voices for the wrestlers . 
it has a similar texture .  .  . nothing changed at all . 
on the plus side ,  every ground is a uniform size . 
i took one pill and became so high ,  calm and non motivated . 
they are very pretty i wish they had fit  :   . 
i pushed the thing all the way in and it wont work . 
water boils quickly and the device switches itself off . 
even at the bottom of the mug there was no residual powder . 
dockers belts ,  including this one ,  used to be quality made . 
apple has it beat with the touch and the iphone . 
if you look closely you will see the differences . 
this thing is not fit for it s intended use . 
neat stuff huh ?  that might change in the future . 
the box says that the toy is bpa free and phthalate free . 
who knows what ways this company is exploiting africans and south americans . 
honest to god clear skin that rarely broke out . 
it eventually got so bad ,  that i just turned pass interference off . 
i ordered a size smaller after reading the reviews . 
it worked for about num_num min ,  and stopped . 
today she tried to run and fell down three times in these shoes . 
it ll keep in your frig for as long as you need it . 
if you need a product that works for your num_extend look elsewhere . 
i ordered num_extend and it s still too small . 
it heats up enough to curl my frizzy hair and make it smooth . 
i reconfigured my proxy server which has performed beautifully since . 
 update  i have just about stopped using this product . 
amazon has replaced it so now i am still stuck with this machine . 
this pale imitation deserves to go belly up . 
i switched to a liquid i could put in his food . 
this mandatory sign up sucks num_extend there are two pages . 
i have very small ankles ,  and this didn t fit . 
i have now experienced those  anecdotal  problems that others have mentioned for myself . 
i would be getting a refurbished unit ,  most likely . 
huge mess to clean up and a complete waste of money . 
its just a bad game so please dont waste your money buying this . 
this filter causes flare distortion because it has a highly reflective surface . 
here is the review having first received the phone . 
i feel it was a complete waste of money . 
we take a lot of fish oil every month . 
i would not recommend this phone to anyone . 
it was a waste of my time and money . 
now i will have to find some kind of adapter . 
this game is nothing more then a mindless filler . 
the outside covers can be chewed off quickly . 
save yourself the trouble of having to return it . 
i would not buy another one of these types of charger . 
less  rubberized  on the outside than the old one . 
i ended up putting in my protein drink at lunch . 
overpowered agents particularly the inquisitors which seem to kill num_extend
agents who take your items ,  and doctors who take e . t . 
you wont have an issue if you purchase the morphie . 
i had to rinse my eyes many times to stop the pain . 
but for me it would have to be a long hike . 
i tried the furminator trimmers ,  which were terrible . 
ladies ,  this num_num is the right size for you . 
if you like your almond milk very sweet ,  you ll love this . 
i just returned this  piece of crap  charger to the store . 
sure ,  it does a little bit to control frizz ,  etc . 
when i get through what i bought i am going back to clinique . 
the gray didn t cover and the color came out too warm . 
this machine made lousy coffee after using it a few times . 
i put num_num drops in a box of hair color . 
when you package something cheap then it feels cheap . 
well .  .  . at least we are using it for something . 
it s very entertaining to watch the coffee brewing . 
then fine :  hit them where they apparently live . 
the num_extend version amazingly while not looking as good ,  plays much better . 
item was cheaply made and did not last a day . 
well if you have blue eyes you better look for something else . 
haven t had a problem with my tivo since . 
i just cannot understand why att accepted such a level of shoddy craftsmanship . 
i am selling it and getting the num_extend
i ve passed the num_num picture point and so far so good . 
this little screaming monkey has got some personality . 
the cord is very short and there is no bass . 
but using  organic  sugar gives them the excuse to charge preposterous price . 
bummers ,  the ball didn t even make it through the num_extend bounce . 
maybe i m just used to better quality items . 
this eliminated most of my prime locations for this unit . 
the designers at mattel are not scoring many points this christmas season . 
this is a cheap piece of crap ,  plain and simple . 
my foot slipped right out of the shoe . 
i really liked the form factor of these headphones . 
this product is cheap even for the price . 
it s acidic ,  and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors . 
there was so much hype for this game when it was first announced . 
i guess the glue i used is partly to blame ,  too . 
you have to squeeze it flat to blow air inside . 
moderate heat and crisco solid shortening applied with bunched wax paper . 
the lid on the tank will not stay closed . 
remember this before you make the num_extend the screen display is terrible . 
pepper belongs on eggs only and not on cashews . 
this is a weak spot of the device . 
they felt like they were moving around my ears and on my head . 
im back with my wood block and am happy . 
the num_num plastic clips that hold the wires are just blatant cheap . 
my cats are afraid of the noise this makes . 
also ,  the subwoofer ,  while powerful ,  has horrible clarity . 
ended up giving them away and using them as dog treats . 
i am perplexed what her issue is with this waterer . 
then as you advance the hours the day language changes  not english  . 
the helicopter fell over and jumped around the floor . 
i do this on my own to make my perfect shade . 
just bought one of these and used it this evening . 
i thought it was heaven and it gave me so much more confidence . 
i have to agree with the recent comments about this product . 
was not satisfied at all it only lasted num_num days on my phone . 
i played a netflix video and it was very loud . 
definitely do not want to be putting that inside a case . 
took me num_num hrs to go from % to %
tech support is poor; performance of this product is extremely poor . 
blood rayne num_num had more moves ,  abilities ,  weapons ,  etc . 
the picture shown was an older mirro press like i wanted . 
num_extend is not long enough to do the trick . 
and i just don t think the toy lives up to the pricing . 
really ,  it was more of a big mess . 
often the necessary resource will only be available halfway around the world . 
but the truth is ,  i don t feel any better . 
in fact it was the only flavor i would eat . 
we got allot more heat from the fire instead . 
i actually saw improvement when i got my nutritional needs managed . 
theres nothing you can do to make them work . 
the back silver linings came out in first week of my use . 
hosting even num_num people is going to be a challenge . 
it covers both the bumps and the redness very well . 
this had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it . 
very disappointed that the heater did not work properly . 
this game is an embarrassment to the series . 
again ,  i haven t used it much and it barely sticks anymore . 
i now have all sorts of winders and am grateful for the deals . 
the videos looked cool ,  and the reviews were pretty decent . 
i hoped the under wire portion would help give me more support . 
won t buy it or any other probiotic phoney again . 
i ordered this ,  wanting standard and just received type m format cards . 
it is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping . 
there s even a sticker which explains what each lights are for . 
i never has migraines before and they were horrible . 
num_extend got gyped on the online play as well . 
i have seen amazing ai before ,  and this ain t it . 
in gaming culture ,  this game is home to one of those levels . 
this product is a good concept but it needs more support . 
much of it did not dissolve as suggested . 
i ware expensive leather open shoes living in florida . 
you have to try them and see what works for you . 
i bought him this kit for some ideas . 
corsair will never again see a dollar from me . 
but that s the only good part of it . 
i like jamba coconut water ,  but it s hard product to find . 
for me ,  this was a waste of money . 
itunes will hang and freeze on trying to play files from the ximeta . 
however ,  the next day ,  i took out the jason deodorant again . 
i purchased this after doing some research and reading reviews . 
for now ,  color me very disappointed . updatemy dog dislikes this feeder . 
listen to the other reviews and don t buy it . 
he saved his allowance to buy some ,  including the dinos . 
theres only so much fun u can have with this game . 
i am just glad i used all four holes rather than three . 
i would not recommend for use as a kitchen tool . 
i don t think i ll ever play another final fantasy game again . 
it is like the hard plastic case is too small for soft one . 
i guess for the price i was expecting too much . 
some people like it ,  but not for me . 
i thought buying a more powerful juicer would speed up the juicing process . 
other bread it kind of cuts ,  kind of tears . unacceptable . 
it did not last num_num minutes after a complete overnight charge . 
we tried to fix but it was not happening . 
definitely no one over num_num pounds sat on this . 
on the num_extend the battery drains in six hours . 
but it didn t hold up as well as i expected . 
made of cheap plastics and material are not going to last . 
i tried it on for num_num minutes after num_num weeks from the delivery . 
not recommended for amateurs ,  but still cool none the less . 
if you have played tony hawk ,  run away from this game !  . 
but then they probably wouldn t sell as many replacements . 
normal use ,  and a dvd player should last longer than that . 
this time ,  i don t notice any difference at all . 
the case was cracked and the cd had minor scratches on it . 
i purchased a cheaper conventional outdoor antenna and reception is perfect . 
also used the cream from the same company . 
it makes the hair looks perfect every time . 
i have to pry my pistol out of this thing . 
i now have a rather pricey paper weight . 
so i am holding it with a rubber band now . 
the stainless steel caseback is the best made part of this watch . 
quest bars are far away and best bar on the market . 
all of which i have no doubt will last beyond my life time . 
this size num_extend was the smallest i have ever tried . 
for the last one i used num_extend of liquid royal jelly with ginseng . 
some of the voice acting in the game is really cheesy . 
read the product literature and made connections as per the instructions . 
also because of my high arch the straps on top were too tight . 
i don t see myself going out and getting more any time soon . 
my dog destroyed this thing bc it was to small for him . 
i will never feed my parrot a peanut product again . 
additionally i was told that the product has been discontinued . 
the strap works it s way out when the pack is full . 
those who say otherwise must have stuffy noses . 
i wanted a pitcher with a white top . 
see my update at the end of this review . 
don t sell them to a discounter or something like that . 
this however ,  didn t work at all for me . 
i will never ,  never use this product again . 
i have dry ,  rather light olive toned skin . 
the yakima rack pads seem to do the trick though . 
i ordered this thinking that it was a good upper low end product . 
if you really have to get it ,  at least rent it first . 
they are delicious and taste like a candy bar for num_num calories . 
its a waste of money ,  and it is expensive . 
i ordered this for my num_num year old . 
the braun model i had previously owned was no longer being manufactured . 
i feel like it was a big waste of money . 
did not see any noticeable difference using this on my dog . 
i purchased this for a friend whose kitties are very happy and healthy . 
it sure is not addictive as the first aoe . 
it is all in the marketing ,  do not fall for the hype . 
the circles to assist fielding are way to large and intrusive . 
i m not going to be a return customer for this item . 
the marker application isn t very practical to apply . 
this was your ordinary chilled coffee and cream drink . 
the rack itself is structurally sound and quite sturdy . 
it s sharp enough ,  but the guard didn t work at all . 
weird . it isn t very expensive so ,  no huge loss . 
big mistake . i will never buy from this company again !  . 
nice shirt but it is for a big and tall man . 
the small is too big for my chihuahua . 
then i was able to get captain commando and m . 
i returned it for a cuisinart which i am perfectly pleased with . 
it contains a number of ingredients that have a cooling effect . 
so really ,  the ai ends up doing everything . 
after a curse or two i cleaned it up and went to walmart . 
i have bought two of these and neither work . 
i would not recommend this toy to anyone . 
but the bar tasted mainly like old nuts and vitamins . 
i would not recommend this brand at all . 
a call from a friend changed all that . 
blade dulls quickly ,  and after a year ,  the safety broke . 
i think its waste of money to buy a charger that only last num_extend
made it for the first time tonight and blech . 
i live in wisconsin and love cheese of all kinds . 
top quality performance and a six num_extend year warranty . 
i wanted them to work because i liked the concept . 
i could not lay my hand on it natural and be productive . 
how embarrassing would that be if i were out in public ?   :   . 
after num_num minutes no way should any part of that food be cold . 
this product is not great ,  or even close to good . 
the color are super cute and colorful which i love . 
so i purchased one asap . this is unstable and unsafe . 
dab nutrition shipped this to me instead of my real order . 
i even had to blow pretty hard to get it to make sound . 
this is a game aimed towards children ,  i would say younger than num_extend
i am also concerned about the additives in it like the silicon dioxide . 
i have a black coat and this pashmina sheds hairs constantly . 
giving this device two stars is pretty generous . 
so far it sounds like a good game ,  but it isn t . 
they haven t taken on the coffee space as experts with this machine . 
the food bin is made of very thin plastic . 
there is no getting attacked on your way to anything . 
the handle is hollow and didn t come with a saw . 
it tastes like plain water with a hint of ginger . 
a waste of money because i had ordered two . 
in my opinion do not buy this product for the num_extend
this is not paraben free nor is it any good . 
simply put ,  this flavor doesn t do it for me . 
cut packing tape all day ,  and it needs to be sharpened . 
the battery part of this works really well as a spare battery . 
some products are good ,  some just okay ,  and some downright bad . 
i ll probably use the heelbos to clean my car and toss them . 
i can make better expresso in my old num_num bar steam machine . 
the phone was under warranty so i sent virgin an email . 
when the yolks were slightly filmed over ,  i tested the whites . 
however ,  reinstalling the software under xp became problematic . 
it even seemed like more of a comedy game rather than a horror . 
it feels  gummy  in the mouth and is all around unpleasant . 
i used it at night ,  once a day . 
there are times where the router works fine for days at a time . 
the way the handle is designed is awful . 
convenient that it doesn t have to be refrigerated . 
tai chi that i do everyday they are made for . 
i looked this problem up as well ,  and guess what . 
it s convenient for him to carry around for work . 
the manufacturer s comment below is questionable in num_num aspects . 
amazon recomends special k for me but will not ship it to me . 
but it s not the greatest case in the world . 
he chomped up the other ones right away . 
i don t see what all the fuss is about . 
more predictable and sane camera angles ,  and num_extend
the picture is a very dark blue ,  so i ordered it . 
to my dismay this unit will not play my vcd s . 
used my old fashioned hot water bottle and never appreciated it more . 
it just wouldn t wake up despite having a full charge . 
it s mildly annoying on low and a whizzing gremlin on high . 
i was getting all kinds of lens flare and ghosting with it on . 
i played it once and that was enough . 
these are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself . 
i bought this as part of a christmas present for my cat . 
using cheap materials to save cost does have its own costs i guess . 
this does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience . 
i bought a brand new num_extend lcd samsung . 
okay i heard all the bad things about the game . 
on the third use of grating cheese ,  it went silent . 
the result is something so flimsy that jawbone inc . 
the boning doesn t allow any bending or give at all . 
this one fits in the palm of your hand . 
i ordered these to sculpt polymer clay and they arrived today . 
the sensor doesn t seem to cover a wide area either . 
the only negative thing i have to say is about the game itself . 
i was quite pleased when i found this for him . 
luckily ,  my phone survived without a scratch or mark on it . 
i keep it in a pie place because it is so messy . 
the biggest loss is that there are no more explosives or cool guns . 
one of the three cats ran from me like i was the devil . 
lasted for almost num_num year before one of the sides fell off . 
buy this game only if you are a die hard collector . 
not like a latte ,  not like coconut water . 
i am very sorry i purchased this toaster . 
it popped fast ,  and almost all kernels popped . 
i got this because the instyler was out of my price range . 
everything sticks even at low heat and a lot of oil . 
unfortunately ours only lasted a little over a year . 
the smell is very artificial ,  overpowering ,  and generally displeasing . 
about an hr or so later i got a call from the company . 
do not make the same mistake i made . 
it would be nice if it was also free of harsh scents . 
the elastic hadn t released after who knows how many hours . 
cat and dog dander are not the only allergens !  . 
i thought it was more delicate ,  instead it is very brash . 
the sole is hard and unyielding with a hard arch built in . 
save the money and put it towards a set made for  older  kids . 
bf vietnam does a great job at atmosphere . 
finding the ideal combo between your face and razor blades can be tricky . 
and ,  the countertop somehow always ended up a mess . 
i have good luck with the smoked units . 
it does not irritate like the rest of the line did . 
pros :  it goes on easily enough and takes off . 
i bought this screen just to try out a different screen . 
this also has to be held until installed once you fill it . 
i wanted one that would fit his small head as well . 
i m not sure what will happen if you do . 
they are very tight and would lift up my screen protector . 
it also has a somewhat stickyness that it leaves on your hands . 
how disgusting is that ?  !  the main ingredient is a corn filler . 
the bra really digs in on the sides and was extremely uncomfortable . 
i know the price was right ,  but the quality isn t . 
this one is a little tight in the console . 
it is reminiscent of peach candy with a somewhat odd aftertaste . 
kinda defeats the purpose which is to be  hands free  . 
that is why  doom num_extend and  quake num_extend have a num_extend option . 
quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data . 
however ,  look at your local stores first before clicking  place order  . 
which sadly also describes how pushing the power button feels . 
it also is separated and has a lot of yellow to it . 
however ,  they were not worth being that uncomfortable . 
i bought this pig based on reviews and though it was cute . 
this one was expired and i would honestly call it rancid . 
the lotion did not feel like it lasted very long . 
i also think the arial attack could be made more interesting . 
the price was good but the product was not . 
the graphics are a mere shadow of the pc version . 
instead of got these round chopsticks with a spiral design on the handle . 
not sure what is was ,  but she hated it . 
buy a cheap bucket or save a free cardboard box from the mail . 
i bought it when my twin girls were num_num and they are now num_extend
but based on my experience i don t recommend this one . 
i don t get what all the glowing reviews are about here . 
you can t exactly make the hanging lamps into anything but hanging lamps . 
they have several sizes and types of plugs . 
i noticed a couple weeks later ,  the bottle was still almost full . 
however ,  i recieved no communication that such an issue had arisen . 
my fish even seemed to act different like they were not very active . 
i ve bought num_num of these and had issues with both . 
there is no cautionary wording to keep this away from children . 
can t say too much more and the other reviews said it all . 
too bad the price isn t lower for these cheap things . 
this tool has a tendency to fray cable strands . 
i wash their bedding and vacuum at least every other day . 
they have ruined what was a great sock . 
 even if it doesn t have nba legends to play as  . 
oddly enough it rusts in only two places . 
it will still be functional ,  but can no longer easily be carried . 
the oem is underpowered and samsung should be ashamed of themselves . 
it tasted like coffee made with old milk . 
one of the usb charge does not work either . 
about the only thing that s good about this is the aesthetic design . 
it makes you have the silhouette of the michelin man wearing diapers . 
if you own the pc version ,  shun this game forever . 
i thought this case was metal ,  but its cheap plastic . 
thankfully i got the marks off in most places eventually . 
and i mean uncomfortable as in it chafes and scratches . 
had ordered this banana along with  my cats balls  . 
a previous opinion noted that the oxide is not absorbable . 
i am very disappointed with this product from sony . 
this game only gives you a sertain amount of time to complete . 
it is bulky ,  not too small at all and not thin material . 
nasty smell and it dried my hair out big time . 
if this is in it they won t touch their bowl . 
and there is no way to make it work . 
what i received was a bird seed dispenser . 
it smells nice and i love the natural ingredients . 
i asked for budokai num_num not budokai tenkaichi . 
however ,  the forward position locks into a rut . 
i bought tivo from amazon . com ,  saving myself the sales tax . 
i ruined more shrimp than i peeled with this one . 
there are many ingredients  all of which i finds unnecessary  besudes the chocolate . 
thought about using sole inserts but then the ankle is still unsupported . 
it s the end of may and i got this in april . 
my bird would not eat it as it was too hard . 
i ve been buying these same pants for years . 
these a very thin cotton cloth pant with a minimun of texture . 
the marketing buzz was the wonder ,  not the product . 
i ordered this product and it took num_num weeks before i got it . 
i filled two glasses with num_extend of water . 
i am glad i waited to write my review . 
not very conditioning for a  leave in conditioner  . 
i have purchased num_num because i see them as disposable toy junk . 
it just seems too common for electronic appliances to fail these days . 
i had two many years ago on a marine num_extend
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal . 
these headphones are trash when it comes to num_extend
this is a perfectly sized steamer for a pound of shrimp or veggies . 
i ordered dark blue but got purple well violet but its ok . 
oh well ,  grandma needs to find something quieter i guess !  . 
 good luck on getting a kid to remember num_extend
with the wheels ,  it measures num_extend in height . 
when all put together ,  they are very flimsy and awkward . 
do not waste your hard earned money on num_extend
two applications only managed a dozen or so blackheads . 
once i got it on it looked good . 
if you drop your iphone a lot do not purchase this . 
however ,  view cjk web site has no problem . 
i would definitely not recommend this for hair removal . 
not a fan of this flavor at all . 
i only gave it three gulps before realizing this is not for you . 
package did come with num_num front and num_num back films . 
i only give this item two stars . jim in ohio . 
i opened num_num and was able to return num_extend
of the entire num_extend only four of them worked out of the packaging . 
well ,  i bought one and it worked fine the first time . 
it will not support any sdio card other than toshiba s bluetooth card . 
good luck to you if you decide to purchase it . 
i m gonna try a different tube next time . 
you can also buy chicory and add it to standard coffee . 
it began to fail again after just one more use . 
i have very dry skin that is also mature . 
it shrunk up in the back and fits horrible . 
a bit of a bummer since it is large and not used . 
obviously i will never do business with this source again . 
the game is simply too big for its own good . 
serves me right for buying a strapless bra online !  . 
not sure what i am going to use these for . 
i bought this product about a year ago . 
the bottle will probably last me at least num_num months to a year . 
i was eager to try these head phones . 
it can t be seen since it s behind the frame . 
this pruner fell apart the very first time i used it . 
i do not recommend this product because it simply hurt to use . 
however ,  i could not get consistent results with it . 
i am on num_num shampoos and the color is still holding . 
i purchased this stand and it arrived slightly bent . 
a very tight squeeze for my htc num_extend vision phone . 
i thought the noodle would be a bit different as it is udon . 
she picked it up once ,  and that was it . 
unfortunately ,  there are several reasons why the num_num sr is a bad num_extend
again i am disappointed with the quality of the product . 
this arrived with a manufacturers defect  a chip under the lid  . 
neither makes for great fun playing cards near the water  as the theme num_extend
the next time ,  though ,  i smelled burning plastic . 
this really made my hair frizzy and unmanageable . 
have to take at least num_num capsules to equal num_num lactaid pill . 
i used it to connect my iphone num_extend to my yamaha reciever . 
however i am quite short so that could just be me . 
it does plug in ,  but not far enough in to hold securely . 
my wife became physically ill and had a major headache . 
the sifting screen seemed too fine to allow the clumps through . 
it was half the price of the c . b . 
i forced it back in and rezipped the velcro . 
he was unable to free any rock as it s extremely hard . 
i can only assume the company cut back to save money . 
i already take collagen and thought this would be a good addition . 
its cheaply made junk that will work some time . 
i ve unlocked and rooted it and now use it as a backup . 
probably half a year and it will be useless . 
the length was great ,  but the fitting was just weird . 
and fp has no customer service or troubleshooting on it s site . 
i drink it black ,  cold ,  in a frap . 
i have had my linksys router for num_num years . 
i will use the dryer without the attachment . 
the cable does offer superior picture and sound quality as the product claims . 
expensive way to buy num_num little cars that roll nicely . 
i liked the idea of wearing them around my neck instead . 
i stayed out of the sun and wear sunscreen daily . 
perhaps men with strong hands like this ,  but i don t . 
which of course is the whole point of the device . 
i love the zico coconut water in the little tetra pak boxes . 
this is a latex ring covered by a very cheap fabric . 
do they do anything ?  no ,  can you ride them ?  no . 
they can asking any price they want to . 
i will never again buy a plastic rolling gas can . 
i have to give props to amazon ,  though . 
i threw it in the garbage to express my disgust at this purchase . 
unless you actually try to put three quarts in it . 
i went online to try and replace it they were out of stock . 
like they were in a store for num_num years . 
if you thought irish spring was over the top . 
okay ,  so i put it on the charger and it charges to %
that was fine initially since it was a refurb . 
for starters this will not cut a sweet potato like it says . 
brunton has recently begun manufacturing compasses in the us again . 
trim it to smaller than the rear shield corner . 
i was really looking forward to this case . 
i m knocking off an additional star because someone removed the date altogether . 
i think i may have picked up this batch around that time . 
this game edges toward feeling like a teacher s aid . 
i unplugged the adapter and the problem went away . 
everything has been made % cheaper and crappier . 
it may fit a num_num y . o child but not an adult . 
what should i do ?  does anyone have any opinion on this ?  . 
the tag states that it is a num_extend but it is not . 
pros :  uses less batteries than the space shuttle . 
it took nearly two weeks before i received it . 
it looked absurd under a shirt ,  so had to end it back . 
i bought this unit to take with me deer hunting . 
like the clarins tinted tanner for legs ,  for example . soooo disappointed . 
the platforming isn t bad ,  because it actually feels fresh . 
even clp cleans better ,  and that s not even a bore cleaner . 
crow bars and tire levers are supposed to be made out of metal . 
so it was time for a new one . 
the hydraulic mechanism used to raise and lower the stool jams frequently . 
i was taking everythig with food and nothing was working . 
when i hooked the booster in ,  i got max %
just cutting the window out would leave scratchy num_extend
most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts . 
just stop making these games if this is your final product . 
i am really supprised that coleman put thier name on this kit . 
those are some hot chips ,  with a fantastic flavor . 
the laptop recognized the transmitter but the mouse never connected . 
during my pregnancy all the vitamins have been making me extremely sick . 
i bought it because it was on sale for about % off . 
these are sized large !  i buy med or large in pants . 
not something my gd wanted to play a lot with . 
i do like the adapter that comes with it ,  that is good . 
i d opt ofr a baby with a built in rattle . 
i have been a really long quest for the perfect cat litter . 
ea will never have the option of my business ever again . 
there are a lot of problems with this toy . 
now form that piece into the curve shape you see in the picture . 
aside from downgrading to windows xp ,  there is no solution in windows num_extend
unfortunately it is one of the better ones . 
it smells terrible and almost impossible to use . 
get a better one ,  and avoid the belkins ,  they are junk . 
i ordered this product for my sister because she has a machete . 
we didn t have any problems with paint or anything like that . 
and it will shut off automatically just as you get everything set up . 
i ordered this from amazon ,  not amazon market place . 
so then i had to use the knife . 
received this product in which many of the nail tips were broken . 
i had to throw this out because it really didn t taste good . 
the faces became blurred and the colors turned to mush . 
i couldn t get passed the first level it is like impossible . 
after about num_num months of very infrequent use the cup started to rust . 
i do like the pocket but that is about it . 
some games still look good on the num_extend even to this day . 
doesn t zip around or bounce or do anything special . 
have no idea why the spray is so highly scented . 
it is a diverse world . but these look terrible . 
monster stakes out a claim as being the best in audio equipment . 
don t buy this . amazon needs to change the picture and description . 
very upset with this kind of business practice . 
i don t have high hopes for any assistance from them . 
just like eminem ,  it s tired folks ,  move on . 
also ,  i seemed to have much more trouble with signal strength . 
sweatshirt is reasonable quality; however ,  not nearly as described . 
half life num_num is possibly the best game ever made . 
i m a num_num so i picked up a num_num as suggested . 
i bought this based on the recommendation of my vet . 
over time with use ,  bottles began to leak at mouth . 
and during that time my nails barely grew at all . 
i tried that ,  but the problem merely got worse . 
this one comes up way short in that department . 
it actually is longer lasting ,  therefore i give it num_num stars . 
it looks like a good toy but they dont like it . 
i think the wattage ,  ohms or voltage may be a factor . 
i contacted the seller and i had no response . 
my husband tried it as well and said the same . 
don t waste your money on these junky pads . 
the light blinds you at night  just like num_num headlights  . 
i think i should have ordered a size num_extend
a lot of money to pay for something with such a short lifespan . 
it s not a problem for me since i like the cleaner look . 
up till then ,  it was our favorite pool lounger . 
stay away from all microsoft input devices ,  they are no longer quality . 
i used it regularly for num_num months before it just stopped working . 
i tried to return it ,  but they would not let me . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
its not like square to make a rpg like this . 
i am a small person and they are too big . 
will probably live with it rather than mess with a return . 
i bought num_num units and plugged them into different locations in the house . 
i will without question be returning this knife . 
it s about num_num times cheaper ,  and i look like tom cruise . 
for the num_extend they should have carried out their promises to the fans . 
was super excited for this to come but it never did . 
i ordered this battery this month and was a  fulfillment by amazon  item . 
the gameplay is bad and players are unresponsive to commands . 
very slow to use compared to a standard scale . 
i didn t notice any unpleasant odors while using it . 
then the kickstand broke after about a month of use . 
i had no other use for this product . 
this is not the former princess aerobic shoe . 
yes it happened to me first time i used it . 
plus i m a size num_num and this was too big . 
i would have given it only a one star . 
i would prefer the slices to be a bit thinner . 
i wish i never hit the confirm purchase button . 
by the third day ,  i was eating them and crunch . 
gave this a try on a whim due to good reviews . 
i could only take one bite and that was enough . 
the brushes are also all too small to be usable . 
it is precise .  .  .  . a perfect egg  s  every time . 
i had dry itchy skin and hives for num_num weeks ,  ugh . 
 and you can t object to what you don t hear . 
when it does ,  you ve wasted a lot of money . 
these fall into the you get what you pay for category . 
i wish that i had not purchased this product . 
right price thought ,  i suppose you  get what ya pay for  . 
they work but sr sun tour are much better . 
i returned the num_num new bottles and hunted down the older formula . 
i am not a happy person right now . 
sadly ,  this cable while it looks good isn t super reliable . 
their is nothing like exploring a new world . 
unfortunately ,  this thing was not useful to me at all . 
use ice pick or awl to punch holes and assemble . 
thankfully ,  i have an old one that works beautifully . 
the leopard part is like a cheap leather and cardboard . 
it s like it is not hooked up at all . 
but i contacted amazon customer service and told them my story . 
the seller neglected to state that this antenna doesn t work alone . 
well within a couple of hours after applying the solution . 
which brings me to something else i didn t like right away . 
urbz is billed as an edgy ,  street savvy version of the sims . 
only had it for less then num_num months . 
comfortable even in my very active job ,  while offering much needed support . 
now i have experiences grado s ultrasone s and stax s . 
i should have read the ingredients more carefully . 
therefore ,  i cannot recommend this product to anyone . 
raichu has one attack pikachu doesn t ,  mega punch . 
amazingly enough ,  this game has really good controls . 
he only had half a stick and it upset his stomach . 
so i decide to buy a mini trekker also from lowepro . 
i thought the squirrels were small to begin with . 
i put treats in it and my lazy cat couldn t care less . 
there were a handful with a minimal signal . 
going on a long flight or not near an outlet . 
i would be weary of giving these to children . 
this is not the filter i remember using num_num years ago . 
for the price ,  that is not very long . 
other fresh n clean shampoos work really great . 
there is absolutely no need to have bent the cable in this manner . 
hours of fun in that one ,  though . save your money . 
i have never in my life seen anything so stupid or cheap . 
that is if you don t receive it already broken . 
the vet said he is perfectly healthy and questioned the food . 
my old case holders did not work in it . 
if your body tempture gets too low you die . 
love the bright colors and it easily folds up . 
i wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food . 
i have ordered these several times in the past . 
i needed a shirt that fit now not six weeks from now . 
bottom line ,  it will get the job done . 
i have no idea where any of these other people are coming from . 
i ordered ismooth after seeing and reading a large number of positive reviews . 
my sister said hers does the same thing . 
it is not fun enough to have it for only num_num days . 
i cannot recommend this for anyone with intact taste buds . 
i was expecting something good ,  but found nothing . 
as long as that is what you expect ,  it s fine . 
sad ,  but it was more than we could handle . 
i own both this machine and the breadman ultimate . 
i hope they keep making it ,  it puts others to shame . 
and continously get blindsided by enemies for the most part . 
there is also no support or documentation for the product . 
it says it is quilted and insulated ,  but it s not . 
it is cheaply made ,  and doesn t work well . 
i would recommend getting a bag less wireless vacuum if you are considering . 
if only their packaging policy was that good . 
i am very surprised and disappointed that this fiber has such high ratings . 
but opened this up and found one of the launcher legs where broken . 
i cannot honestly say that i have noticed any effect from these caps . 
first of all i ll start by saying that the graphics look spectaculaire . 
it broke down in the very first use . 
the num_extend connector does not fit my cell or wireless phones . 
its not a round product which is part of the problem . 
organic is a word that is being misused to sell products . 
wouldnt really hold onto my hair and kept slipping out of my hand . 
when i stopped it they returned to normal . 
microsoft blames my gateway even though it always worked before the update . 
it seems that maybe kittens would like this . 
it is about the only bra that actually fits me num_extend
this is not what i wanted i ordered the wrong item . 
perhaps my eyelashes are too thick ,  but it never curled them . 
what i had hoped to be a very special gift is now unwearable . 
the next morning i had a terrible headache . 
the company that sold it gave me a full refund without any fuss . 
the plot is terrible and the voices are as bad as castlevania . 
i paid shipping and handling to send it back . 
spend more money and get a better quality one  :   . 
if someone knows why this happens ,  i would like to know . 
my bad; had to try it and fail after several days of torture . 
there arent many good hd movies out there . 
the buttons are junky and i can tell they ll fall off soon . 
went back as soon as i got them . 
i really like the other ancient harvest gf pastas . 
this product just doesn t do what it says it does . 
final fantasy should never have gone online because it ruins the whole series . 
i asked them to notify me if and when it is improved . 
cats had no interest anyways and who wants their babies eating mold anyways . 
i was very dissapointed when this showed up at our house . 
the taste was alright; nothing particularly special ,  probably a solid three stars . 
it boasts that it is fingerprint proof and it is the complete opposite . 
all of the military units are the same . 
these are old phones with dead batteries or nearly dead batteries . 
i give up on poppers i will use a pot on the stove . 
i prefer to use a mix of gluten free flours instead . 
consider num_extend with vbr encoding set to highest . 
that doesn t work for my purposes so i m sending it back . 
my secretary jammed it and all the pins broke . 
i went back to my own hair drier and hand drying . 
for this price this lens doesn t deliver much satisfaction . 
it also has an annoying whine most of the time also . 
this is a medium blend ,  and i like my coffee much stronger . 
my internal drive made a little noise ,  but nothing like this . 
this was inexpensive and you could fry an egg without any oil . 
and most have come to think of that taste as cheese . 
i m going to exchange for fruit of the loom . 
i got this back scratcher for christmas stocking . 
the inner boot is not lined ,  only the shaft is . 
it s a shame because i really wanted to love this toy . 
they lost interest quickly and moved on to the next toy . 
if you really want to lose weight ,  go see a dr . 
when i tighten the straps ,  the fabric bunches . 
the glue traps and snap traps were effective . 
we never really figured out what made her sick . 
i wish i had as much luck as the other reviewers !  . 
it makes my nails shiny and it worked wonderfully . 
it didn t dry out my skin or make me break out . 
maybe you want to get another color beside white . 
the advertising said inhaler it is a spray and is not very effective . 
get if you can beat red and blue without cheating . 
i see no reason to own this item . 
rent it if you haven t picked one up before . 
first of all ,  everyone wants to get you . 
do not buy any chinese item made with rubber . 
the litter was all over my bathroom floor . 
this is another game that won t run on modern pc s . 
these are great knives but num_num times the cost of cheaper sets . 
so i had to return them and wait for my money back . 
i put it in the dock ,  but the phone does not charge . 
dont let fanboy s or overly exicited people mislead you . 
another problem is that the cups don t transfer heat very well . 
i got frustrated and contacted fobus through their website . 
i had to melt the damn thing off !  . 
and i thought maybe wrong model s been sent but not . 
and sunbeam is owned by another company ,  jarden . 
i decided to give a try to this type for once . 
it is played in the third person view . 
nothing has helped me to get this to work . 
one must have been in the living room and was spotless . 
it does last much longer than the original . 
customer service put me on hold forever and i finally hung up . 
maybe someone on an auction site wants it ?  ?  . 
i purchased it for christmas num_num for my num_extend year old . 
not sure what happened but wouldn t have expected this . 
i risked opening the seal to sniff it ,  and lost that gamble . 
the zipper did not glide smoothly and the leather was stiff . 
i will just stay with trader joe s thins . 
for this reason ,  i do not wear them . 
also ,  the filter had the hoya name but was made by tokina . 
i urge businesses to send a new one to me . 
the handles are the biggest drawback being very flimsy . 
i tap the tip lightly with my finger and still nothing . 
i m not a huge fan of this flavor . 
i didn t really liked the story but my son loves the story . 
hopefully the pets expansion will make up for this disappointment . 
thanks to amazon return policy ,  it went back . 
i like hard ,  glossy ,  polished materials that work with me . 
the brush heads are also quite pricey for this . 
i will never recommend to buy this product . 
was expecting a better experience with this product . 
i have had others but this one was poorly made . 
i wish i knew they were placebos before i bought them . 
this broke the glue that holds the two sides of the mirror together . 
i have experience with many sharpening methods ,  sharpening stones included . 
i bought one for about  price  and used it for only a year . 
this is the worst generic gta ever made . 
right off the bat ,  know that switch isn t your traditional soda . 
however on the label it clearly states made in china . 
inside the bag wadded up at the bottom was the necklace . 
they are very cute ,  and he loved them . 
they keep falling off my not so perfectly shaped ears . 
i first had an  overload  warning and then a  replace battery  warning . 
i would recommend doing more research before purchasing . 
there are other problems but everyone else has covered that already . 
since then amazon turned a deaf ear on me . 
i will be giving them as gifts instead . 
when i received the bottle ordered from amazon i started taking it . 
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster . 
thats why it gets one star . just stay away from this stuff . 
it is a bit larger and it never needs a battery . 
the package sent to me was damaged ,  the whole box . 
the sound that the animals hear with it ,  gives my daughter migraines . 
not at all the quality i was expecting . 
it is just not a good quality cat food . 
the flavor on these is pretty gross though . 
half the price of this and double the coverage . 
i even tried it on one eyelid and nothing on the other . 
i like it ,  but it really is not safe . 
sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works . 
if you are curvy don t even think about getting these . 
the drm is the least of the problem . 
look at some of their other products though . 
in less than five seconds the nook cable s charging light turned off . 
i didn t read all the print on the box . 
maybe it would fit better on a bigger foot . 
would have costed num_extend to repair so got another one . 
i will go back to turtle products from now on . 
there was a tear on the side ,  never got a response . 
sorry but these things taste horrible and look even worse . 
a full charge won t last too much longer . 
so sad to have to give this report . 
nonetheless ,  this renders the wireless router useless to me . 
that it was dim that caused me so much pain . 
even kids must wear down after hearing this too many times . 
this screen protector does not stay on the phone . 
i specifically purchased from here because of the retail packaging . 
these things run if you just look at them wrong . 
what a disappointment for a highly rated toy . 
you have to give up whatever case you have today . 
saw picture on facebook so i ordered it . 
the real casemate is a very good case ,  but this was junk . 
they are very small and are placed very close together on the box . 
it involving replacing the defective cable from the plug leading into the mouse . 
just like the boy who just broke up with me tonight  :   . 
i bought it for the color and style instead of the quality . 
the second coat went on a little better but still more streaky . 
this face wash drys my skin out terribly . 
it popped the first night kids started playing with it . 
finally people seem to be agreeing with me . 
that information is still not included in the product description text . 
you just can t get enough control with the handle . 
i love the size and how fluffy and absorbant they are . 
and then it said i was located in a city ten miles away . 
i thought i could run a cord though it based on the picture . 
either way you will be replacing your otterbox after num_num months . 
the final beast is just way too easy . 
my prior pda at least had an excuse . 
this doesn t work with the htc one model . 
i ordered a pair of black num_num levi s from this seller . 
it is now one of my favorite tools for work . 
same here ,  you pedal like crazy and go nowhere . 
i bought this shape sorter for my daughter . 
you will be very annoyed every time you go to empty this thing . 
upon opening the container i found all the pills to be cracked . 
i m definitely not the target audience at num_num years old . 
have never had these issues with the chunky chews brand . 
buyers please avoid and dodge a bullet with this one . 
the ai is always out to get you . 
petty as it may sound ,  the labels keep peeling up . 
there were changes to my skin and they were not at all positive . 
i use an android battery monitor app called battery monitor widget pro . 
and for this ,  it does a fairly decent job . 
if your dog is a chewer ,  get something else . 
it also has flaps that cover the usb connector and headphone jack . 
this product would be nicer if it was more sturdy . 
for one thing ,  forget about making multiple characters on the same account . 
lasted just over num_num months and burnt out . 
i mostly buy them from the grocer in smaller portion bags . 
this toy has been a constant source of frustration since i bought it . 
i would not buy this again if i had the choice . 
her tail stuck out the back and looked uncomfortable . 
you may wish to start using these types of products every other day . 
i tried hooking it up to my denon amp . 
now i have to buy another pair to replace these . 
its only fun when you are playing with num_num or more people . 
there are six levels ,  each takes about an hour to complete . 
after phone went through the wash the screen was ruined . 
tom philpott wrote an article for the grist warning about triethanolamine back in num_extend
they are a bit hard and very chewy . 
i wouldn t recommend it if for colored hair . 
it is consistently making him sick and he doesn t even like it . 
instead ,  it is just sweet with strong bite . 
it has a light scent that isn t overwhelming or medicinal smelling . 
buy one from a well known arms manufacturer . 
worst ,  adjusting the stiff shoulder straps is difficult and frustrating . 
to start with ,  i m a big fan of goji berries . 
it s no surprise that these natural foods not so natural . 
if the child looses one ,  the picture can t be completed . 
he threw up directly after me feeding him a couple of these greenies . 
i ve banned everything memorex from my house because of this . 
i wear uniform danner boots everyday at work . 
i got an extra charger with a set of two batteries . 
this review is for an iphone num_num gsm digitizer from arizona accessory . 
we ve only used this twice and it is already fraying . 
there was lotion covering the bottle under the plastic . 
this brand is pretty cheap and the handle is flimsy . 
it turns out my daughter has a pair that are the same . 
and it smell terrible it is one of the smelliest polishes i have . 
the gooey texture of this product made it difficult for me to chew . 
the opening sequence ,  the audio was broken and the video was jerky . 
i took a chance and blew my money again . 
i played all the civ s and for years enjoyed them . 
this mandatory sign up sucks num_extend there are two pages . 
eventually it will give you a start screen . 
not sure how this got so many num_num and num_num star reviews . 
persons with sensitive and troubled skin should think twice before purchasing this cleanser . 
in may num_extend it was hard green chunks ,  blue s response . 
and thinkthin use whey protein as a part of its protein blend . 
expensive especially if your cat does not play with it . 
so i have been ripoff again first doom num_num now quake num_extend
i would prefer some method of minimizing friction indoors and outdoors . 
just doesn t work for me or offer any relief from my congestion . 
i love garlic but didn t care for it in the mashed potatoes . 
after a couple of hours of use it became uncomfortable . 
i rated num_num stars becasue they are not complete junk . 
the cheap silicon doesn t stay on the phone . 
the fumes are really bad from this toy . 
not for my dogs !  a very poor quality dog food . 
although i do have a regular beautiful nose . 
if you don t believe me ,  please try it for yourself . 
but in my house ,  it didn t pass the kid test . 
she is delighted with my  high price  taste . 
but the part about hands free voice control was below par . 
i ve been making my own for over two years . 
i liked the look of it ,  but that is about it . 
i can only describe it as a  dirty barnyard  stench . 
my guess is something must have been wrong with the leather . 
formally ,  they were manufactured in japan; now they are made in taiwan . 
bought num_extend two came with the lid broken off in the box . 
others have noted that this item discolors in the dishwasher . 
we both were not pleased with the taste . 
it looked as if my zipper was open at the top . 
the left side already does not work . i had my old . 
however ,  that version is gone from the marketplace . 
i actually ordered this not seeing that it was green tea . 
in fact ,  iphone is only couple hundred more and worth it . 
the material that goes over the rocker on the otterbox is terribly stiff . 
though the price is low ,  i did not like it . 
i order many things from amazon and will continue to do so . 
i purchased this because it sounded so good . 
i tied a blanket to the top ,  she chewed through it . 
 i did find that our daughter liked the traditional drum better !   . 
its super cheap and i don t mean the price . 
i started with the pads and covered over % of an exercise pen . 
two things make me recommend not buying this num_extend
but if you carry it out covertly ,  you re golden . 
i even did a patch test on the inside of my arm . 
it ended up only working half the time for some unknown reason . 
i could of purchased a $ adhesive to do that . 
it is about as basic as basic gets . 
i would honestly love this if it weren t for the fragrance . 
the product works great if you like to look at yourself . 
star wars :  sote had a lot of potential . 
the hard plastic on both sides was annoying . 
still with in the ship date and the expiration date . 
they arrived and worked fine with full instructions . 
i would not recommend this cable to anyone . 
so now this expensive mug is totally useless . 
couldn t really see or tell a difference when taking these . 
the product did not do what it was supposed to do . 
pack of four  and i just received one box . 
this is definitely not the same toy i had as a child . 
this doesn t !  there is not much smell to it at all . 
i think i ll be purchasing another num_extend in the near future . 
its bad enough they have a bad image already . 
the only big things that happen are at the end . 
it turns out that it was the game that was missing something . 
it s a design flaw ,  and makes the keyboard wholly unusable . 
there should have been a way to turn that num_extend
the crock has a big crack in the bottom ,  making it unusable . 
this is a waste of the packing material used to ship it in . 
it wasn t in any package beside the shipping package . 
seat feels soft to the hands but it feels hard on the bottom . 
i have a chronic disease and am very disappointed in this item . 
the hose is too short and it is not worth the effort . 
i always liked the might and magic  mm  series . 
i hate a growing mouse in dark num_extend
peel off the rag and rinse it in the sink . 
if these shoes were actually triple e i ll eat my hat !  . 
he was the tsa head of that airport . 
i own num_extend num_extend and this num_extend num_extend
doesn t work very well on my android tablet . 
perhaps it was the nostalgia ,  perhaps the clever packaging . 
this game does nothing but steal time away from you . 
too bad ,  really liked the hydrostatic ballhead otherwise . 
sure ,  there s some neat water effects but it s overdone . 
too hard for a child at the age its recommending . 
i have no idea why it starts our great then gives up . 
for my num_extend old boy they were way too tight and uncomfortable . 
these cases offer okay protection ,  but at a cost . 
 you could ,  however ,  give it to your wife or girlfriend;  . 
of all the tomcat products ,  this one has to be the worst . 
that would have been a nightmare to reduce down to an even layer . 
well ,  it s permanent and the material is cheap and flimsy . 
the judges make huge errors on the scoring and statistics . 
i want to add this addendum to my review . 
also ,  the blade seems to dull after a few sessions . 
the one i use only has palm oil in it . 
i am not sure exactly why amazon ,  ebay ect . 
i really felt that this was for a much younger audience . 
its too long and theres no face to face fight mode . 
all that you can do is save your character . 
but as far as peanut butter sandwiches i will pass . 
i no longer comment on any items until i actually receive them . 
otherwise ,  it s a great blender and works as advertised . 
first i emailed them; over a week went by with no response . 
you can t do split screen like the previous game . reason num_extend
the graphics are about as good as the old playstation num_extend
i bought these for my older pugs who have arthritis and joint pain . 
it took a lot of heartaches and phone calls ,  tests ,  etc . 
it died at the end of march num_extend
ordered a khaki pair and a black pair . 
hardly wore it and already it was ruined . 
i smelled like sulfur all day long ,  which eventually made me sick . 
i would prefer either crisper cookie or a softer cooky . 
turns out it was too small ,  way too small . 
num_num num_num num_num must be time for brand change . 
just a cheap black rifle case with sufficient padding . 
this has got to be the worst made cable i ve ever purchased . 
let me start by saying that this bark collar is terrible . 
this is like putting baby powder on your face . 
my girlfriend and i have used my different lubes . 
i am addicted to hair products and try everything on the market . 
i don t think i will buy these again . 
but one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree . 
the size of this cooler is not the dementions they say it is . 
i adore the christmastime peppermint mocha drinks from starbucks . 
my old cat couldn t eat it very well . 
in the meantime don t forget to check out   .  .  .   . 
but within less then a year ,  each of them failed . 
sorry ,  samsung ,  but you can do a lot better . 
powerful hype erupted when resident evil num_num was announced . 
i love the idea ,  these just aren t made well . 
so i took my new scanner home and slept on it . 
i wonder why they made it like that . 
this spray didn t work at all for my pup . 
when using this ,  my skin felt sticky even hours afterwards . 
the first set was like the picture shows with holder included . 
this stuff was cheap ,  but it didn t do anything . 
you walk a bit ,  fight a bit ,  and thats about it . 
there was one thing that said acel ?  not sure what that was . 
still not thrilled with these seemingly cheaply made mousetraps ,  however . 
this pad stopped working after num_num months of use . 
in the end ,  it was thrown in the trash without being finished . 
luckily ,  selsun blue  the medicated one  worked in one treatment . 
you should see the size and quanity of my fruit . 
did a % water change and waited another week ,  still stable . 
when i opened the pouch the first thing i noticed was the smell . 
neither of my cats will eat this food . 
but in my civic it wasn t so good  cheap tuner  . 
i used them to wash the small crevasse s on my motorcycle . 
i will wait until all the bugs are ironed out on this game . 
with exception to the cars the game controls great . 
it s just as well ,  it was the lowest cost . 
i was expecting more ,  because i usually love tresemme . 
this game ,  however ,  i didn t care for much . 
baking it for longer time didn t help it much either . 
one of the reviewers here stated that he s also gotten different sizings . 
seems to be a generic cable ,  belkin is not imprinted on it . 
i did not try it standing on my head . 
i did not notice any difference in her paw pads . 
he said they would send the food back to purina . 
i was disappointed as to how small these bio balls were . 
i guess i will have to stop fooling with these people too . 
their seven grain blend seems healthy and the sweetener is evaporated cane juice . 
made of  u . s .    in between the two wings . 
since the pot contains the heating unit ,  everything had to be replaced . 
i just assumed sony would be smart enough to make that a feature . 
i actually had a new one stashed away num_extend model  . 
people are complaining and amazon does absolutely nothing . 
the front of the house has a white light shown in the picture . 
i will wear these until they wear out . 
i have been professionally fitted for a bra so i know my size . 
i now do the limbo dance and vacumn at the same time . 
everything in moderation along with activity  movement  will lead to fine health . 
the colors are bright and vibrant ,  but the polish itself is horrible . 
timex this is my last iron man purchase  !  !  !  . 
it is important to realize a major factor here . 
replaced it with and iriver aft num_num and will never look back !  . 
it did not keep all brass out of hair . 
this is a cute toy and my kids love it . 
i bought a cellphone thinking it was new but not so . 
i wanted to give it num_num stars but it wouldn t let me . 
i will say that it does the job . 
does a good job ,  however ,  i probably will not buy aging . 
i am very disappointed in the durability of this doll . 
a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and soul blazer town rejuvenating . 
prior to it shorting out ,  it would get too hot . 
it holds all my nail polishes and is sturdy . 
however ,  the songs don t play for longer than num_num sec . 
i ordered two for my grandsons for christmas . 
he had the rabbit sickness known as the snuffles . 
the remainder wound up caught up in the product somewhere . 
i heard that using an actual razor blade would help . 
but unless you toast coocnut ,  its really just for a topping . 
i did dump out and never buy again . 
bought this thinking it would be like num_extend but boy was i wrong . 
the only time it does anything is if it s on your phone . 
i agree with most of the other comments . 
i have really damaged hair and this didn t help it one bit . 
trying to clean the bottom of a blender . 
i do not care about bargan or cheap . 
taste like old soup sitting for a long time . don t buy . 
can be a real mood killer ,  if you know what i mean . 
figured they were cheap ,  but not blow up it your pocket cheap . 
sometimes food was just sitting in some chest ,  waiting to be discovered . 
the inside kitties are pretty easy to manage . 
i see nothing like this in the indigo prophecy . 
i was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are . 
i have already started looking for alternatives ,  don t buy . 
first off ,  the lack of superstars ,  and extra superstars . 
it drips down the front when pouring water . 
returned for a pair of brown gradient lenses . 
i struggled through the remaining workout ,  all with lighter weight than usual . 
love these sandals ,  but my insert kept slipping out the back . 
i returned to my plug in ear buds that had better reception . 
i have tanned for years and used tons of different types of lotions . 
dog loves it but it won t fly for long . 
so i would not advise buying this brand . 
this one is not at all like that . 
synthetic material except the curvy handle and but plate are heavily rubberized . 
she has to become the princes favorite concubine . 
i bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews . 
i should have read further as it was a big disappointment . 
i used it once and have not used it again . 
maybe it works in other situations ,  but not this one . 
but from a adult perspective i m just not impressed . 
after exactly one year after purchasing it ,  it died . 
i thought they would be bigger for some reason . 
nice idea ,  doesn t hold enough  i have the small one  . 
seemed like a convenient idea ,  and an environmentally smart one . 
i ended up buying the num_extend tactical  stryker  pant and fits better . 
i need to buy another one but not from akron . 
i paid way more than i usually do for shoes . 
this is pretty much the worst eyeliner you can get out there . 
but even a cup of them still has less sugars . 
my main complaint was the inability to remap the control figuration . 
this is by far the worst wireless broadband router i ve ever used . 
joining this with the dificult game camera movement ,  makes the gameplay dificult . 
either the lid is poorly designed or just a bad fit . 
it was nice for the price; but not enough color . 
well i must say i was expecting much more . 
i purchased this product because of heel pain . 
i m not wild about the way the maxells fold up ,  either . 
i bought this set mainly for the bigger brushes and . 
as soon as she does it ,  her brother follows suit . 
they are starting to see some wear on the handles . 
no hemmed elastic liner in the waste band . 
i got a new one sent out quickly . 
you are not free to move everywhere on the map . 
what this error means is that your phone is now inoperative . 
i m researching and that seems a problem with logitech products . 
i should have realized by a few of the reviews . 
when the cars crash ,  that is funny and entertaining . 
sorry but i ll stick with the normal num_num foot cable . 
i only wish it would have lasted longer . 
after a day ,  i think my pores had actually gotten larger . 
i bought this first for my razr maxx and later for samsung galaxy num_extend
i have too many great rts games than to play this . 
the gameplay is similar to dynasty warriors series num_num thru num_extend
the character has many more abilities and the game is actually entertaining . 
they do feel good but my shoe design was the problem . 
it also constantly dropped and locked after about num_num mo . 
the pets are okay ,  and the larger neighborhood is nice . 
onegames i lost was due to unstoppable running back . 
the taste is sticky sweet and very artificial . 
also ,  i had trouble with the sides collapsing . 
i think they are a smidgen short in length also . 
witness the many attempts to make batman and superman even remotely interesting . 
i feel like this purchase was really a waste of my money . 
i have one of them for each of my bettas . 
it seems that linksys outsources manufacturing to some place that manufactures trash ?  . 
however ,  it s a perfect size for my num_num month old . 
i have a pair of num_num pound cats . 
i can however recommend thehanes cswb boxer briefs . 
the portions are really small for the price . 
if anyone wants a barely used pair of num_extend let me know . 
you should definitely use this without mascara and then apply afterwards . 
these are not brownies ,  never have been ,  and never will be . 
wow here i am writing a bad review . 
just messy and shoddy quality from a company that has zero customer service . 
i have the wii version and is horrible . 
i gave it a day and started again . 
this one works well and has a clean fresh scent that i liked . 
this seemed to give little or no benefit . 
also ,  not to mention the idiotic mission plots and objectives . 
we ll for the price can t really expect something more i guess . 
i got this headset for use with the logitech precision controller . 
the color i got with this product was awful . 
but ,  overall ,  you d best just avoid buying the stuff altogether . 
then my stomach had to deal with it . 
my hair feels the same after using this . 
either borrow it from a friend or rent it . 
i only recommend it for something light weight . 
real boxers don t throw num_num punches a round . 
i got this for my son ,  since he loves the cars movie . 
it s like forbidden island but with less thrills . 
the convenience and ease of use definitely got my attention . 
can t return it ,  but i never wear it . 
the smaller cutters seemed sharp enough to work . 
i recommend you get city of heroes instead . 
not so !  mini usb doesn t fit and cord is very short . 
i also had problems with molded boxes in their couscous . 
it looks beautiful but had lots of trouble putting it together . 
the item pictured on amazon is not the item you may receive . 
these were within num_num feet of the base transmitter . 
i ve tried it twice and then throw it in the trash . 
this is probably the most violent game i have ever played . 
i think i ll just continue to use my hands from now on . 
these things have beautiful sound quality i won t complain about that . 
the engine basically only works on brand new batteries . 
it will need to be replaced waaaay before num_num weeks . 
on one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything . 
here ,  by contrast ,  the early questions are much more serious . 
so all you can do is look at them . 
but they don t really even have a strong pinto bean flavor either . 
one is a vizio ,  one is a samsung . 
this stuff does not really clump up either . 
did not help with food cravings or weight loss . 
people say i sound like i am in a muffled tunnel . 
these patches don t seem to work for high pressures . 
i ll try another reservatrol supplement ,  but not jarrow formulas . 
a huge part of the game was trying to beat your old scores . 
for the first time ,  i can walk out the door . 
will look at other bases and see if they are higher quality . 
as another reviewer noted ,  the fabric is almost translucent . 
the bed is rather comfortable and inflates quickly . 
at any rate ,  they need to be better flavored for my dog . 
i decided to make some zucchini  noodles  with it . 
it is a fairly nice quality double boiler ,  but it is small . 
 :  good thing i bought a bag of num_num though . 
it is advertised as new when i believe it s actually refurbished . 
the huge boy with balloons sticking out isn t necessary . 
i like the design idea of this item . 
i have had to resort back to cutting his mats out . 
these are probably the best for the cost of most panniers . 
farewell ff ,  it was a good ride for a while . 
we bought for a long road trip we were going on . 
already had to toss num_num pairs after a few washings . 
and the thick strap around the front is not flattering . 
i must have taken my stupid pills the day i requested these . 
my mission was to find a screwdriver for my num_num month old . 
i was originally pretty excited to play re num_extend
not the best but bigger than you think it is . 
i had to dye it all over again with something else !  . 
it might work for nails ,  screws ,  paper clips etc . 
the monitor would randomly stop being detected by the receiver . 
i didn t eat an entire serving because i actually felt nauseous . 
tried it num_extend will not stick to dash or window fell off continually . 
it is smelly and does nothing it says it should do to help . 
this shirt will clearly have to be ironed however . 
well i had one on my first two systems . 
i did not think that jeans would wrinkle . 
this basically hydrates your muscles and allows them to expand . 
the buttons don t line up to a num_extend
i still have about num_num more jars to experiment with . 
add lemon and honey also to taste and you re set . 
i fell in love with this little clip on lens . 
what can one expect from  made in china  . 
my new pyrex measuring cup went in the trash . 
i also wore a hate every time i was out in the sun . 
it s very heavy and the plug is huge and heavy . 
i have not seen any even slight difference . 
this unfortunately seems to be one of the miss on other hair types . 
not sure what happened and was not worth trying to figure it out . 
i wanted to get a really good pair . 
you better have strong teeth if you try to eat this stuff . 
and the next morning the dog through up chunks of plastic . 
they were literally falling apart as i was wearing them . 
i bought this because it had the highest ratings at the time . 
very disappointing fit and not comfortable at all . 
they still look perfect ,  but i had to replace them . 
i saw the wipes in a postpartum kit that used to be available . 
i would prefer birkenstock for somebody with a pronating ankle . 
i didnt want to wait a whole month to get a refund . 
my clark s mules and clogs are considerably more comfortable and supportive . 
picture shows various colors ,  yet you cannot choose a color . 
it was very very short and left a rather empty ending . 
it is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot !  . 
only good for stacking a few drink cans or maybe some fruit . 
i paid $  gasp !  had no idea other stores sell it for $
now it is sitting under the back seat . \ . 
normally our german shorthaired pointer eats the fancy food . 
i feel this is a strong waste of my time and money . 
however ,  i never got this keyboard to work with the e . 
i wanted it to be a little better quality . 
but ,  you don t have to give up taste to avoid gluten . 
so you can t shoot crates or other things to discover hidden items . 
it says reall chicken but it is not . 
the watch works fine but it looks too unsightly to wear . 
i have the num_num qt bowl ,  and i love it . 
the first time i used this product ,  it s fine . 
i figured i would try it out .  .  . but huge difference . 
she said the formulas are the same but the consistency is looser . 
you could mail this thing in an envelope with three first class stamps . 
will use it for right now and look for something better . 
this cushion didn t work for me at all . 
my creamers are coagulating and i have used only half . 
this is a cute ,  but not so worthwhile appliance . 
i am partially disabled and have difficulty with shoes and socks . 
we only used it once and never used it again . 
the jean is flimsy to say the least . 
i know my size from all my others . 
their prenatal vitamins were good but not these . 
i plain just don t like these fruit snacks . 
you wont be able to display higher resolutions . 
the worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life . 
carbon filters to reduce odor from the containers ?  another num_extend
i have deep sharp nerve pain ,  and it didnt do anything . 
these num_num products actually strengthen my hair and leave it moisturized and shiny . 
this did not work for me at all . 
it made my really fine hair super frizzy at the top . 
the texture is interesting ,  bigger ,  fluffier and crispier than cheerios . 
i have fellow shooters and range masters chuckling at me . 
customize the amount of flavor in your water . 
as a kid i remember waiting for cookies ,  etc . 
i wanted to wear these as indoor sweats . 
this game should never have been allowed out . 
the main problem is the patterning on the handle . 
i like there other products but this one was a disappointment . 
once the honeymoon phases was over ,  my face went berserk . 
perhaps if you have num_num minutes per shot you d do well . 
the solution is without a doubt mostly witch hazel . 
the stove itself  not the pump  is heavy duty . 
they at least kept responability for their own coding in house . 
this product does not hold my toddler s attention in the least . 
there s no automated task that occurs when the train goes by . 
heed thy words ,  save yourself the trouble on that . 
as did my table and anything else the flowers touched . 
i can t understand why sony made such a poorly constructed headphone . 
grab a handful of cloves and boil them in water . 
i only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working . 
the zagg is absorbing the someting from the leather . 
i might mess up num_num in a num_num  over looking lint  . 
this is the third ghee i have tried off of amazon . 
ypu ll tire of this quickly and demanding your moeny back . 
the little box they provide does not hold together . 
it rarely works and was an absolute waste of money . 
i even tried adding more tape and it still didn t work . 
there is no support for this game through the developer . 
the truth is ,  this product works awfully for me . 
but it looks like a good mount for reguler qr releases . 
it broke the first week i had it . 
and it s not like those machines are power hogs . 
the instructions are the worst thing i d ever seen . 
i see that this has a good rating overall . 
these have been my favorite : gls audio num_extend cable cords . 
several of the pieces were cracked in both sets i received . 
the ideal pet doors are not very durable . 
i will say the product s package and shipping time were good . 
the other two are starting to pull very bad . 
it is being sent back for a refund . 
you have to crush treats in order for this work . 
do not order from the same place i ordered it !  . 
the sound a whale makes is a splash . 
it is still pretty but not what i really wanted . 
there are a few good games but not very many . 
people who really need this functionality should look elsewhere . 
after two more times i just returned it to amazon . 
in los angeles ,  we rarely have a downpour rain . 
this stuff makes my hair feel greasy right after i wash it . 
then i got in the shower and it washed off almost completely . 
perhaps if one has a teeny tiny vehicle then this may work out . 
i ve been with the  wild arms  series from the ground floor . 
probably wouldnt puchase this type from this seller agan . 
nothing like a nice peach ,  nothing like canned peaches . 
i wouldnt even give this to an enemy . 
it is a struggle each time to pop it open . 
i will not buy this toy again not worth the money . 
i wrote the company about this ,  see below . 
then you use an activator marker to make it glow in the dark . 
good isloation ,  good material and decent sound quality . 
it s very rigid ,  i could not possibly fall asleep on it . 
i purchased this dvd player as a gift for my daughter . 
i got this pull toy for my daughter for christmas . 
ended up giving what i had left away . 
don t waste your money !  couldn t be more disappointed !  . 
i think these are weak and the flavor is just odd and unpleasant . 
i couldn t wait to take this one home and try it out . 
but that s part of the fun ,  figuring things out . 
its kind of rediculous to put big ugly tape patches on a couch . 
i knew i shouldn t have deviated from the plantronics . 
my phone fell out the first day in this case . 
in fact ,  the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings . 
i m not sure if it s his size that s the issue . 
well ,  this wave power cleanser hardly does the job . 
in short ,  they made that sequence entirely too long . 
the cable that runs to the antenna was just barely long enough . 
the comparably priced bushnell is better  i own that also  . 
the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize . 
over six weeks ago i purchased this case of suet . 
it is actually kind of salty and soft ,  not crunchy . 
all you can carry is two guns and grenades . 
never did get it up to num_extend fully inflated . 
worked and it had a long cord which was nice . 
avalance software must have spent one day configuring the ai for this stinker . 
this is great customer service and have added a star to my rating . 
that s what happens when you ship jobs over seas . 
this burns terribly if you apply it within hours after shaving . 
this is not the same as the stuff i bought from the store . 
we used it religiously for about a week . 
i live overseas and returning it will be expensive for me . 
both of the connectors went out within a few months . 
it s strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost . 
i got this watch to replace my cherished num_extend anniversary edition ironman watch . 
mine has been malfunctioning ever since i rode w it in the rain . 
applying more of the foundation just made it worse . 
they sent me num_num num_extend cent coupons for my next purchase  !   . 
sure i can take a blow torch to it . 
you have to work it very smooth for a long time . 
it worked great for taking him into restaurants and on trains . 
i only dab a tiny amount all over face and gently rub in . 
i can not use it  ,  so i am not happy . 
it was a $ and tax down the drain . 
so gross !  exfoliated my lips then put on the gloss . 
did not relax my cat neither stoped them from straching my furniture . 
you see it plain as day ,  num_num out of num_num stars . 
next ,  the magnet signaled a low battery warning . 
they assured me that they would send a new lid . 
within two days of receipt the glued seams began separating . 
and ,  the litter pieces are big and hard . 
i should ve ordered a size up instead of a size down . 
my jack russell did not care for them . 
this product came with the expiration date mostly rubbed off . 
i find the graphics and the game to both be excellent and enjoyable . 
the color is what was expected ,  however the fabric is very thin . 
i am going to have to switch him back to iams . 
that is what i did then i threw it away . 
dont waste your money and time buying this game . 
it depends on a number of things ,  including your internet service . 
i am very unhappy with this piece of junk though . 
gave num_num star because this product is basically junk . 
no longer are players forced to use computer controlled cities as rallying points . 
i m afraid to plug this thing up to my iphone num_extend
i would not ever buy this crap again . 
on june num_num the razor failed to hold a charge . 
these shoes are not the quality i expected for the money . 
one side of my house is a favorite gathering place for burrowing animals . 
i didn t see the point of keeping it !  . 
so you will normally fail to notice it is in there . 
one reason is because of the way the batteries fit into the charger . 
the general layout of each level is either predictable or awkward . 
this game will never touch my num_extend again . 
yet of our group ,  only about % go for it . 
this device did not work with my cell phone . 
melee made the experience richer and more satisfying . 
i lost both of them within miles of home . 
you start by selecting the general you d like to be . 
it wouldn t even stay attached to a glass window . 
i ve purchased hanes crew socks for many years . 
i thought there would be more of an echo . 
i will let you know how it works when we get it back . 
these boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . 
this will charge i pod and i phone but not your ipad . 
i paid $ for this plastic popsicle stick with a razor blade . 
the dress was very cheap looking and the material was very thin . 
i immediately sent a request for a return thru amazon . 
you can try max payne num_extend a great single player game . 
knife is rather large and bulky ,  which was hard to determine online . 
i don t really see the point of these shoes . 
every time you pump it up the red dot moves . 
i also tried leaving it in ,  as described on the website . 
this game has serious flaws which fantasy flight refuses to address . 
today i finally received my num_extend {second} griddle . 
doesn t close completely ,  letting matter flow into liquid . 
needless to say ,  he s not the least bit interested in it . 
have to find something else to do with it now . 
the contact point where the wok will sit . 
the raspberry chipotle had some bite ,  but i could handle it . 
don t touch the contols ,  and screw everything up . 
i do not recommend this product ,  regardless of price . 
but you can get the gamecube version which is alive and strong . 
my kids num_extend and num_extend have had this for about a year . 
i was so disappointed with the quality of the parts . 
is there we are at now ?  i wish amazon would be . 
it earned its one star because it doesn t leak . 
i ll figure out what brand those are and go back to it . 
bought this on the advice of my hair stylist . 
i am completely confused as to all the praise this game received . 
they seem to be a faulty deign or bad castings ,  one . 
i bought it but not able to use it . 
it lasted a very short amount of time . 
just lay it back down and it continues to charge . 
like most people mold and mildew is an issue in the bathroom . 
so i had to not play that family at all . 
but one of the major feature is missing . 
whoever created this game was either out of his mind or a masochist . 
my knives were dull ,  and this sharpener didn t do the trick . 
i ll be looking for a different device to replace this one . 
i felt like i was trying to dance covered in saran wrap . 
these are cute and comfortable but the quality is beyond poor . 
however as a consumer i felt there should be better ones . 
the paper was thin and kept tearing from slight wind and arrow removal . 
in the meantime ,  i found a different case i liked better . 
as others have written ,  there is no mouse support . 
it s unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design . 
my major problem is with the lid of the pot . 
after about num_num weeks it completely stopped working all together . 
so i sent them back for a refund . 
this item does not work and is a total waste of money . 
the only thing i ve not used is bleach . 
maybe if this product was flavored he would enjoy it better . 
the bits don t even file nails very well . 
this is suppose to be a great first single blade helicopter . 
i used this along my collar bone to combat some sun damage . 
i would like to see how this works on short spiky hair . 
spend the extra money and get the lifeproof case . 
my daughter has more fun taking this toy apart than playing with it . 
i am going to sell it in the near future . 
ok ,  so i m a little late to the halo party . 
i have this same model ,  but without the num_extend addition . 
deleted games and hours spent stuck in walls are rampant . 
recently ,  i ve been searching for a good ginger tea . 
the steel is practically worthless and you get very little flint . 
unfortunately ,  the multiplayer part does not redeem itself either . 
now i am stuck with something i cannot use . 
expect air bubbles galore in the protector with this product . 
you are damned if you do and damned if you don t . 
just not worth purchasing if they break easily . 
but for num_extend cents i didn t really expect much . 
i kinda wish i could return it but at least it was cheap . 
however ,  this product is not worth the purchase price . 
however ,  the bars i received from trade concepts are stale and brittle . 
i am a big man num_extend num_num and it to big . 
this last batch tasted nasty as compared to previous batches . 
sorry but save your money on this one particular model . 
levis is one of the oldest companies in the u . s . 
i had hopes that i had simply received a malfunctioning speaker . 
i do not think it is going to hold up so good . 
but it just doesn t quite cut it for me . 
we bought the update and it seemed to work after that . 
i didn t bother opening it ,  just sent it back . 
my body is still pretty out of whack and fragile . 
loved num_extend but that was when steam was only mildly annoying . 
i would not recommend these wraps to anyone . 
and it just looked uncomfortable ,  right up against her front legs . 
these plugs did little to dull the sound . 
the product simply does not work well for me !  . 
doesnt stay clipped to my belt ,  falls off easy . 
i cannot walk past him ,  and he just stands there . 
but then it could only recharge it partially on my second  connecting  flight . 
i ve tried this on and the fit was just awful . 
and yes ,  i do put oil in my waffle batter . 
this product is so dim you cannot see it . 
for a $ pair of scissors i expected much better quality . 
we walked through the standard printer setup process but still nothing worked . 
had santa bring these for christmas this year . 
maybe the burr wasn t seated correctly as some have noted . 
i bought this case because it looked really cool . 
go to ebay and you will not have this problem . 
the item arrived on time an in great condition . 
then it was recalled by hunter because of a  fire hazard  . 
that should tell you something about the quality right there . 
so i soaked and washed and soaked and washed and soaked and washed . 
very disappointing and i feel like i wasted $
after flat ironing my ends were still frizz . 
there will be lots of pulp coming through . 
anyway ,  the wheelie cars don t go down the track ,  either . 
this bra is made out of very heavy material . 
the meat inside is gray even though i do not overcook it . 
my skin looks better on the gl brand ,  too . 
i thought this would be very educational for my num_num month . 
they wear and feel like your basic hanes or fotl . 
they should pay me for warning people off of this tube of disillusionment . 
like the title says ,  these are just junk . 
just got this in and it is totally cheap . 
this is the num_extend case i ve bought for my num_extend
i really view this toy as a complete waste of my money  :   . 
title says it all . i bought two of these . 
however ,  it is very easy and very repetitive . 
capcom shows once again that they dont use enough testers for their games . 
within about num_num minutes ,  i had a misquito bite on my shoulder . 
i have bought a few of these foam rings . 
i got the coffee and made a pot . 
and they do get tangled up unlike their description . 
i was really hoping this would be more fun than it was . 
just for fun ,  i tried putting that through the machine . 
when the program is working ,  it works ok at best . 
i think it also makes my hair feel more dry and brittle . 
it is a struggle to pull my phone from this case . 
it has a band almost insipid taste that is lost in every dish . 
even when it is loaded with the treats he loves . 
it doesn t seem to make an  air tight  seal at all . 
relatively it is but both it and the old pump are loud . 
lights work but not as bright as i would liked them to be . 
this was actually my favorite from the box . 
that is just a terrible decision not to include the franchise option . 
i would give them zero stars if possible . 
you might regret you did !  i sure did at least . 
i tried to fix them to no avail and just tossed them . 
i used this product and still was sunburned . 
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years . 
this turns everything to babyfood !  it does not chop ,  it purees . 
when i wrote this review ,  it was almost $
when i first got it ,  i was excited . 
i honestly bought it for its great smell . 
finding a case for your iphone can be a daunting task . 
this is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device . 
while it was working ,  it worked quite well . 
i did notice that the bra was made well ,  good quality bra . 
i just could not get into this game . 
it fits but does not encompass the phone as advertised . 
i must tell you ,  this is not worth they money and time . 
but i cannot return this one either because the return expired already . 
i have drank bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it . 
all and all ,  it s simply too much bra for me . 
i know they re cheap ,  but i wasn t expecting that . 
go for the black abs bolts for your pistol crossbow and avoid these . 
i tried to like this stuff but it is to sweet smelling . 
you can probably fit num_num credit cards top . 
if your feet tend to swell ,  they will get tight . 
you would fair better lashing a knife to a stick than using this . 
i think i d rather play risk than this game . 
i get an error message on my monitor  unsupported screen resolution  . 
i have yet to see it make the soap foam at all . 
now that i have a better design i am happy . 
i gave it a fair attempts and couldn t notice any difference . 
the film just will not stay flat because the adhesive is very weak . 
yes the are cheap and you get what you pay for . 
very dangerous and we would not buy these again . 
the pears were so green that they were crunchy . 
ultimately this unit does not work for someone who has a heavy hand . 
i think you should be able to breathe . 
wiggled the cable end in the socket at it would disconnect . 
great size for the mirror itself but try another one . 
i think it is still usable ,  but that seems wrong . 
that part of the game was most fun of all . 
that ought to tell you what people think of prey these days . 
he is too smart for his own good . 
strangely ,  when we were living in arizona this product performed better . 
really disappointed with the quality and alignment of this case . 
still to me it was money out the window . 
i thought the plastic case on the bodum was cheap . 
it does not require any elbow grease and i paid $ for mine . 
the fan is not very powerful at all . 
both of them failed within a few months . 
i think this case is hit or miss . 
i agree with the reviewers who commented on the impractical bottle design . 
these phones sound good for the price ,  but they are uncomfortable . 
i did expect better because mederma is well known as effective scar treatment . 
i give that category a num_extend as for the rest . 
i don t know if they are real duracell or not . 
i ve bought two logitech wireless mice as well as their wired mice . 
the phone just rang and rang ,  and was never answered . 
the phone itself is loose on it . this looks pretty though . 
looked good enough when package arrived however ,  the durability was nonexistent . 
people on the other end of my calls could not hear me . 
it is a sickly sweet odor that smells worse the warmer it is . 
i should have received a full refund months ago . 
this pen has a problem with losing its hair . 
it smells nice ,  and glides onto your face like frosting . 
however ,  what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off . 
i used another nozzled jar sprayer that attaches to my hose . 
a younger ,  stronger person might find this belt helpful . 
but once i reconnected the belkin ,  the buzz returned . 
they are going to take it back and give me a full refund . 
i am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody . 
fyi :  there is a much better product currently available . 
unfortunately ,  the quality is not what it used to be . 
these are suppose to fit ,  but do not clip well . 
made me look like fearless fly or something strange . 
if ordering ,  be sure to order one size bigger . 
i had to use the hammer and pins to get out the links . 
however the flavor of the tea is too weak . 
this game has way to much talking in it as well . 
i was expecting more of a miracle for my hair . 
the battery die really fast ,  and the battery is expensive !  . 
i would not recommend that anyone purchase this . 
i always hated war games where there is an advantage to jumping around . 
do yourself a favor and buy something else . 
they did not cover the whole screen as shown on picture . 
i returned these since i wasn t looking for blisters . 
but the actual missions in the game are forgetful . 
i bought it from a recommendation of another user s review on amazon . 
on my second workout the palm on one of the gloves tore . 
after several weeks ,  not a single mouse entered the num_extend
it did get warm and also to its credit did not overheat . 
dsl reports . com says there s a problem with the latest firmware . 
fabric and construction seemed to be very good . 
the texture is chalky and the taste to me is unpleasant . 
he has always had terrible knee joint problems . 
i would go for whichever was cheaper or on sale in the future . 
he said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . 
espn like replay quality with the two teams playing each other num_extend
this is not a makeup that you apply and forget its on . 
i finally bought some omega pills that seem to help . 
num_extend the charges started being shorter and shorter . 
 no exceptions !   the wording that hides this fact is very carefully organized . 
this skin shrinks by a bit over time . 
would be nice if it came with other types of adapters . 
the band is fine but the cup s too small . 
i would compare them to pajama pants ,  not sweat pants . 
i should ve heeded the other reviewers warnings but i bought them anyway . 
i want a nice sweat pant with pockets and drawstring . 
i put this on and it s helped tremendously . 
i just think it s too big to lack such definition . 
indeed ,  this product simply tanks on every single point . 
you have purchased them ,  at the store .   but ,  okay . 
this is the num_extend rio product in my household . 
i m going to fix it myself and sell it immediately . 
i even purchased a couple more because it seemed like a nice toy . 
the gap was caused by the leather ripping apart where the lacing goes . 
i really wanted to love the v reader . 
i m personally still much happier in a pair of levi s . 
it was the same feeling i had when playing mechwarrior online . 
i read several reviews about this brand before trying it . 
i bought this product for my num_num year old daughter . 
i don t see how anyone could think this game is fun . 
it was such a small amount and really not worth it . 
however on second day threads started to open . 
i do not recommend spending the money on this device . 
so far i m about ten hours into this game . 
my family just adopted an australian sheep dog . 
i cannot believe this item actually qualified for amazon prime . 
and it just doesn t pour well at all . 
this does not blow dry hair very well at all . 
don t let the ads or products specs fool you . 
the photos posted by amazon conveniently do not show the hinge . 
makes game playing a real pain in the butt . 
this glue did absolutely nothing to my lashes . 
i will be buying a more expensive and adjustable heater to replace it . 
i m really sorry i wasted my money on this stuff . 
better off getting a trimag triple magazine holder . 
something has changed  and i admit it may be me  . 
i would not recommend this headset to anyone . 
you know not to pour coffee into a wine glass . 
baggie sandwich bags would work as good and fit as good . 
found num_num leaks ,  but not punctures ,  it leaks at the seams . 
i have owned this player for num_num months . 
don t buy this thing what ever you do . 
the capacity is not working for num_num iphone charging . 
as for the stylus capturing method ,  this is really what got me . 
mainly due to wall height ,  this is an unsafe product . 
you can press the button once to answer the call . 
this stuff is garbage !  back to axe i go !  . 
overall ,  it started out all right in the beginning . 
in other words you can get by mashing one button . 
if you buy it i hope you get one from a good batch . 
it s easily squishable and not super hard like a normal tennis ball . 
i guess i got what i paid for though . 
i would call it an n ,  not a m . 
this is essentially nothing more than thick mineral oil . 
the strip inside the wheel hung out of the split wheel . 
i hate to say it ,  but the quality seems to be slipping . 
i start noticing things that are so obviously necessary to the game . 
it s flimsy and should probably cost about two dollars . 
the absence of certain bass notes is probably what bothers me the most . 
there s no new adult things ,  just a few minimal decorating objects . 
never popped but i hated it so i gave it away . 
it takes very little ,  and it would last you forever . 
i own this product for almost an year . 
it s ok ,  but nothing really stands out with the flavoring . 
i really wanted to like this one ,  oh well . 
people love the long battery life and the quality it good . 
but the controls could be a lot better . 
i was very disappointed !  the mixes tasted horrible . 
i will not be able to wear it to work . 
the smell of some sort of pineapple fruit drink is overwhelming . 
i am glad i didn t pay more for it . 
it would discharge quickly between % and %
faded color ,  goo inside is close to hard . 
i guess they do ,  but the image is small and unclear . 
well the first num_num trips ,  the unit was great . 
i am shopping for a replacement ,  basic pair now . 
don t buy this stuff ,  you will be disappointed . 
i plugged it in this morning and it was ice cold . 
as if someone pried it off to repackage it . 
they are pretty ,  but ruined right out of the package . 
the headset is comfortable and works just fine . 
i used them num_num times and the buckle came off in the water . 
it has provided me with truly limitless adventures and countless hours of enjoyment . 
the plastic used is very thin so they can get thru it . 
now it nicks me every time i use it . 
i even tried it out on two different tvs and still nothing . 
every week i would run the num_num ceramic pieces through the dishwasher . 
i shaved off a pile of this to start my fire . 
two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior . 
i got this on the advice of my occupational therapist . 
the weasel was only attached by a small thin price tag plastic . 
there should be a warning label on these toxic underwear . 
the  front desk  on the first level stinks . 
i will be returning this budget steel from china !  . 
she said it was so amazing and it really worked . 
neither food ,  cosmetic nor pharmaceutical companies in the u . s . 
this is better but only works half the time . 
just because i get longer lasting supplies and better customer service . 
take note of the dimensions on this thing . 
keep away from flame or other heat sources .    .  .  .   . 
both the num_num and num_num were too small for me . 
the ginger tea was just too overpowering to the point of being unpleasant . 
tournaments are boring ,  match after match ,  people love chatting about nothing . 
while not for me ,  it might be what you re looking for . 
way too clear with way too many large flecks in it . 
of the num_num i bought ,  the first four were automatic coasters . 
because it it stickless so there is a coating inside this pot . 
the female side of jack does not work properly . 
i called barnes and noble and got a replacement for free  :   !  . 
the ginger is also apparent ,  but not as pronounced . 
dsl is not compatible with this adaptor on all games created after num_extend
so ,  i went with the closest option ,  which are these jeans . 
this smudges and is difficult to remove or correct when smudged . 
you only need flip the heads open and rinse under the tap . 
you cannot tell that it is jury rigged . 
a cheaper alternative is to swap out wet towels all day long . 
i write this review in relation to two other homedics products i own . 
i have used drugstore conditioners that can do better than this stuff . 
more involved than i would like to have it . 
i think this works best with a really heavy daytime moisturizer . 
after a single use ,  the box was already emitting a stench . 
it s just about impossible to get it on . 
this is the  really small  child size container . 
 she s a pomeranian puppy and only weighs num_num pounds  . 
i will be going back to that one . 
want to sponsor them so they continue this ?  your choice . 
this means they frequently make a nice little mountain when they re done . 
i have found it to be noisy and pinchy . 
instead i woke up to coffee and grounds all over my kitchen . 
they are thinner than what i m used to . 
two months later ,  i got them out and put them on . 
i m not impressed with the product and will not use it again . 
we like chicken and beef so it really isn t working for us . 
it will load and begin ,  but then it just completely quit . 
when you are playing the game ,  the graphics are slightly choppy . 
num_num num_extend months  now and i still have not received it yet . 
the back panel falls off every time we use it . 
i was planning on playing footsies with my wife without cutting her . 
my wood floors are warped due to this constantly overflowing . 
total waste of money it will actually make your water worse . 
after that it started to eat the tapes . 
overall this just seems like a cheap ,  low quality product . 
the next order went exactly the same way . 
it was time to retire the revereware kettle after these num_num years . 
this does not work on persian cats it is totally worthless product . 
you don t rate something num_num if it has flaws people . 
forget the track ,  the kids won t care about racing . 
even if you do work it out ,  reset is a joke . 
it costs a little more ,  but boy is it worth it . 
there is nothing in the manual about how to contact the company . 
result :  lots of pulled hairs and slow ,  slow trimming . 
slippery too !  not at all what i expected . 
it was annoying and it never got better . 
as far as listening to music they are bad . 
i m in my num_extend decade so found this very odd . 
my son recieved this as a christmas gift from my brother . 
either of these are better than the clairol at moisturizing hair . 
the taste of mint was nauseatingly overpowering and i typically like mint . 
the light was satisfactory and reliable before then . 
and it doesn t stay in the cigarette lighter either . 
i d much rather have bought max payne num_extend
the parallax correction on this sight is pretty awful . 
i love leap frog products but this isn t one of our favorites . 
it requires a large coin like a us fifty cent piece . 
until this last couple of orders that is . 
num_extend also it is too difficult to get a rebound . 
as with other i noticed the fit is a bit off . 
i have lots of cats but most just ignore it . 
it came in time and was nicely packaged . 
the glaive is pretty weak as a weapon . 
a third squirt made it undrinkable ,  sickeningly artificially sweet . 
said it wouldn t fit between some of his teeth . 
i loved the features and was very dissapointed . 
this product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable . 
it also washes out in any bright room light or indirect sunlight . 
just shell out the money for a better battery . 
 who needs color ?   num_extend mb memory is more than enough  really funny . 
once i beat it ,  i had no desire to play it again . 
needless to say these have already been put in the trash . 
i have owned this little hub for at least a year . 
i still kind of hang out at the sides . 
nope ,  cant play on the same team as a friend . 
it doese crital damage to rock and fighting pokemon . 
that could be the sugar alcohol i don t know . 
all included people and parts are totally neat and sturdy . 
the main problem is that it s cheaply made and won t last . 
i used to buy these all the time . 
returned these jeans because the did not fit as i would have liked . 
a very expensive litter box to last only one year . 
other ingredients are glycerin ,  purified water and ethanol . 
the tweezers are about par for this kind of gadget . 
the bottom flap is not cut properly and can t completely close . 
i just really wanted the classic connect num_num game . 
as soon as you remove your hand it stops charging . 
but i feel like i can do better . 
now it does not charge through the phone . 
he is still excited by the smell and equates them with greenies . 
i didn t even bother with the g string . 
mostly this has very little ability to increase sound . 
unfortunately it only worked occasionally when the cat passed in front of it . 
the quality and pack ability seemed very good . 
it probably would only cost them num_num cents to do so . 
too much crap to get through before you get to do any gaming . 
i bought this for my new exercise bike the schwinn airdyne num_extend
i would pull batteries for a couple of days and audio would recover . 
however ,  i would really be pressed to buy this product . 
they pull it out after a few tries . 
i felt like my body should have been exuding the orange smell too . 
they are of such high quality i rarely need to replace them . 
the stuff would sit there til it rots . 
i returned the luggage and am looking for another set to buy . 
equalizer might not last ,  but it sure looks natural . 
its cheap plastic ,  almost transparent ,  and the design is barely painted . 
quality in this product a thing of the past . 
i should have known i would not be happy with this for long . 
however ,  i am fussy what i put in my gut . 
turns out the band and case are not stainless as described . 
maybe the encryption hoses this products ability to connect . 
never will i buy from this seller again . 
it s just a clone of grand theft auto . 
its redeeming factors are light weight and ease of maintenance . 
i only get num_extend when the phone is in num_extend mode . 
i am going back to my sauve keratin infusion dry shampoo thats only $
i use it with my iphone num_num and it works flawlessly . 
i typically love neutrogena products ,  so i was really disappointed in this . 
we superglued it back together and it lasted another num_num fills or so . 
it was meant to be flashy for one day and that is it . 
will update this review once i get the new copy . 
this weather radio picks up too much interference through the power supply . 
this merchant states it is roasted to order . 
i am really sorry i purchased this item . 
this is a pretty sketchy listing for amazon . 
the cloth could eventually rip from the constant strain in that area . 
there is very little sour cream or onion flavor . 
i bought these for a fun ugly sweater party . 
she enjoys it very much and can play with it daily . 
it seems kind of big for an average size cat . 
when this happens ,  they no longer hold the weight . 
the sight was installed in one upper and about num_num rounds fired . 
don t know why i stuck with it till the end . 
it has a very small screen and is hard to read . 
spiii is a design from a few years ago . 
i would guess it s fine for styrofoam helmets . 
thank god it survived to have a third title . 
i bought three of these things over the last two years . 
i may give it another chance someday ,  but not anytime soon . 
certainly not what i thought it was going to be . 
i ordered this router because of the high rating it received . 
however ,  they are very tight across the toes and just not comfortable . 
i have fine ,  curly ,  frizzy hair that is thinning on top . 
i can do % of what this filter accomplishes in photoshop . 
i tried using it up to flavor gravy and other dishes . 
fix :  charge battery before use ,  or use num_extend
i m going back to using a $ quantary deluxe padded strap . 
i guess i ll have to drag out the wafflemaker . 
amazon and the seller were excellent for the return . 
will use until i can find something better . 
their is no padding inside for shock protection ,  its really pretty useless . 
pay a little more money and get a sturdy pill splitter . 
you must purchase property then develop it with your choice of buildings . 
if i had such a location ,  i would surely use it . 
so it has nothing to do with the price paid . 
it seems like i would have liked it . 
this is a major design flaw and keeps me from using this device . 
going to buy cheap  yet more durable  rocketfish brand . 
hopefully ,  i will have better luck with the next one !  . 
i have a fairly high roof antenna ,  no cable or dish . 
hubby was torn between this guy ,  and the mr . 
make sure you get the ones sold by foodvacbags not eriver . 
to call this a trap is being very generous . 
what was shipped had definitely been installed in a device previously . 
auto switches when one machine reboots and never switches back . 
on my num_extend frame ,  apparently one size does not fit all . 
i would be upset if i paid num_num dollars . 
i would like to address the most malicious ones ,  though . 
sure ,  killing your subjects is fun and the pet feature is nice . 
what a hassle !  that s all i have to say !  . 
he played with it but he didn t really enjoy it too much . 
however full application of this lipstick simply looks ridiculous . 
if you live in colorado ,  don t buy this product . 
this one lasted me a whopping four weeks before short potting me again . 
it kept my laptop cool ,  its light weight and its very quiet . 
go with the stainless steel ,  marble or other metal ones . 
loving survivor ,  i expected the game to involve more strategy and conversation . 
when i was diagnosed with celiac i tried many different flours . 
it constantly drains num_num ma even when off . 
every box in my case was like a hard rock . 
product was rushed to market and features do not work as advertised . 
i ll still buy jason deodorants ,  but not this one . 
it says it s compatible with all motorola handsets . 
i decided to buy this to put in my bag of supplies . 
i d give this num_num and a half stars if i could . 
survival mode is probably sonic riders  strongest mode . 
my budget athena num_extend speakers have a num_extend tweeter and a num_extend driver . 
num_extend preheat bottle and fill with boiling liquid . 
has no indents or slots for side buttons . 
i will be canceling my subscribe and save on this product . 
it s also really small and fits into the palm of your hand . 
the headphone adapter makes this thing incredibly bulky and ungainly . 
my cat will not play with the rolling ball . 
all of the wiring in this kit is not as advertised . 
repairs are done in ny . then i found that it leaked water . 
post office was suspose to return it to amazon . 
i could have bought a swifer with better results . 
i bought this due to the good reviews . 
there is no scientific basis for sports drinks except for one caveat . 
that is not a con but just what it is . 
the stuff is good ,  but not it s money worth . 
i don t think i would recommend this to another person . 
i thought while this was creamy ,  it was also very perfumed . 
it s very durable but not so user friendly . 
unplug ,  wait num_num seconds ,  plug it back in . 
just paid like a dollar but not even worth the dollar . 
i nearly sprained my wrists trying to knead it . 
i tried widening it but not the greatest results . 
the light module  lcd screen  wil also go bad . 
this is just cheaply constructed ,  and not built to last very long . 
the best thing is ,  it is cute and it s red . 
in the some area s it turned my hair purple . 
i would rate that an easy num_num stars . 
i m still searching for that perfect sports bra though . 
i bought this for a num_num year old miniature american eskimo . 
if the need is great and temporary you might want to try it . 
i m certainly no expert on the anatomy of cows . 
let s see ,  this game was made about num_num years ago . 
i am a little disappointed with dark sector . 
i returned it for a friskas which i am happy with . 
the fall is here and the weather is warm . 
they don t fit well ,  slide around on your hands . 
for the price ,  there surely must be better alternatives . 
unfortunately ,  i never got to give it a try . 
the one i was sold my mobileshop num_num was most likely a fake . 
this chain does not com with a master link . 
so the good part is she really liked it . 
the sound of the sword hitting and the impact point are different . 
it didn t make a difference with my make up . 
if it runs on your computer consider yourself lucky . 
i have a bulldog that s a heavy chewer . 
we have num_num cats and we go through a lot of litter . 
this is the worst wrestling game to date . 
i have a lot of pets and i need a good can opener . 
threads came out and tearing at stitched lines . 
don t get the spray mixture in their eyes ,  nose and mouth . 
the only wear and tear on it was from moving it . 
these are one of the worst sheets i have ever owned . 
i was very disappointed in the taste of these cookies . 
it did not do anything for me like it said . 
after receiving this i found that the shape is made predominately for glocks . 
perhaps mine is unusually noisy but somehow i doubt it . 
seems like half the game is spent waiting to load . 
i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable . 
i don t think it s worth the risk of trying . 
graphically ,  wwf war zone is the first of its kind . 
the cats had  the princess and the pea  syndrome . 
the ingredients in this product is quite alarming . 
how these people got this thing to work ,  i ll never understand . 
i find it rather unamusing that my original beaters broke . 
i find water works just as well ,  if not better . 
the concept is very good however many things need improvement . 
i enjoyed the earlier duke titles and thought they were great fps games . 
if you re in this for the looks ,  go for it . 
i finally got the refund but the shipping was deducted . 
the picture shows a beautiful soft faced girly dolls . 
it is the product i think i wanted but not what was pictured . 
i cannot tolerate the herbs in this formula . 
maybe because the game is so thematically beautiful . 
closing it as in the picture makes the sides lift . 
cute for lego fans ,  but bulb burns out too quickly !  . 
my wife told me this pants looks so big . 
the num_num has run flawlessly since i plugged it in . 
the screen graphics are great ,  hence the frequent battery changes . 
it is not worth the price and it lies about the size . 
one small tug and the fur comes out everything . 
to do so ,  place the camera on the kodak easyshare camera dock . 
bought this because i have flakes on my shirts . 
i could feel them scraping my ear ,  especially when running hard . 
final fantasy num_num has the worst combat system ever . 
i mean ,  it didnt even help to hold the num_num up vertical . 
the cloth on the chest is worn away and the stuffing is showing . 
however the mouseware software does not work on a mac . 
i ended up removing most of the padding . 
as a parent i don t like hearing it either !  . 
she thought it tasted a little stale and bland . 
rather than pay to send them back i paid to have them shortened . 
my dog ran after a squirrel and around a tree . 
the third is usable only in skirmish or num_extend
the part said it would work ,  it totally didn t . 
the adapter seems average in performance ,  in terms of speed and distance . 
these earrings ,  though pretty ,  are very easily smudged . 
first ,  know that it doesn t come with batteries . 
i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size . 
it is very harmful if it contains contaminated ingredients from fish . 
this soup is only edible which isn t much of a compliment . 
the thermometer is extremely slow in registering temperature . 
got this for both my kids who chew their nails . 
i used the product for two days and air quality did not improve . 
nice color ,  but did not hold up to shipping at all . 
this product uses a cheap one piece hinge that is not long lasting . 
and it is vary hard to play . this is a big dissapontmit . 
for now i m just living on the edge ,  without protection . 
retin a helps your skin boost collagen production ,  which declines with age . 
it s essentially a num_extend wok that has a num_extend cooking surface . 
there are home remedies better than this one . 
we returned both pairs and ordered the more expensive zutano slippers . 
got some use so i changed from a five to two stars . 
the first few days i had it was great . 
good coffee ,  but now the price is just ridiculous . 
the cx models are designed to hold the microsd card under the cover . 
toasted with butter ,  the first loaf of the six went like lightning . 
the chalk doesn t work well on a board or on a sidewalk . 
i will be looking for the same rosette handle as a single arm . 
but it usually makes the track pop apart . 
it also stings the eyes from afar when in the shower . 
this might be a wonderful bra for someone smaller chested than i . 
on high ,  this thing compares to a vacuum cleaner . 
this num_num cup replacement carafe did not fit my cuisinart num_num cup coffeemaker . 
they were so oily and greasy that the muffins were disgusting . 
a couple years later and this skillet has not held up . 
this screen looked like a good idea at the beginning . 
certain monsters are vastly more powerful than their supposed counterparts from other sides . 
the night cream version was perfect ,  especially with the beauty serum . 
i started off happy with giving this watch to my wife . 
surge protecters are just right for my purpose . 
byd is the manufacturer of the batteries that are in my uniden phones . 
tried it again at home after cleaning ,  it worked ok . 
it was for my daughter so she can stay connected . 
we lost two in a num_num minute walk ,  they just slipped off . 
i wish i had read the other review before i bought this item . 
i thought a media card like this would be foolproof . 
glorious items that you ll sometimes need on your quest . 
he loves the small nylabones and chews them everyday . 
the amount of shrimp produced is adequate but the delivery system is weak . 
maybe this is a okay set for you . 
pirates !  would have been good about num_num years ago . 
to this day it sits under my bed collecting dust . 
and boom it burst and on the floor she went . 
like the walls were moving farther and farther away . 
my little guy had no interest in this . 
after all the glowing reviews i had great hopes for this product . 
i tried what they show on tv with the lift to the eyebrows . 
i bought the game on amazon but they were not the seller . 
i ll look at another solution like the vent clips . 
every time i d go back to this ,  i would break out . 
this one shows in more of a butterfly shape . 
this sight was really irritating to deal with . 
i am so bummed i wasted money on this . 
they don t seem to work as well as others . 
i love jason s products but this one irritates my gums . 
both are essentially the same ,  though num_num adds pulleys to the puzzles . 
trykirkland hk anderson peanut butter filled pretzels num_extend lbs  pack of num_extend
it doesn t have the feel of a lotion . 
the point of attachment needs to be redesigned . 
madden is lame and ea is a retarded game maker . 
as it is so small ,  i refilled it before it was empty . 
i gave it two stars for the graphics and that s it . 
i would never recommend this to any serious coffee drinker . 
there is nothing wrong with this bowl except for the price . 
i was in the shower and rinsing the dye before long . 
i myself don t like the default uses for the buttons . 
most people now are buying the num_extend or the num_extend ipods . 
this is my only num_num star review of any product . 
so i was surprised and disappointed in this product . 
i got this because of the high spf . 
opening the spout to pour is a little difficult . 
keep doing this until you have a complete set . 
on top of that ,  signal quality and connection speed were poor . 
as the saying goes ,  you get what you pay for . 
but both of these charge the phone just fine . 
i bought this for my son who is a chronic nail biter . 
the one star is probably not fair because i have picky dogs . 
quality and design leave a lot to be desired . 
this unit looks so simple yet so elegant and beautiful . 
and anyway you will get for how much you pay . 
most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited . 
used only less than half year it s broken already . 
the plunger rolled off the counter ,  onto carpet ,  and broke . 
the top most portion of the phone is hidden behind the num_extend
the more coffee you brew the greater the potential mess to clean up . 
my old one ,  different brand ,  totally emptied when inverted . 
 my review is applicable to norpro num_num grater too  . 
pieces fit with lego  well they call it  works with leading num_extend
my bars were fresh and chewy  a tad on the soft side  . 
paid a lot more for it here on amazon too . 
i recommend people try another company which stands behind its products . 
almost immediately the insects puzzle began to bubble up . 
you can find this very discounted at walmart ,  etc $
also it tasted sweet in a weird way . 
we re going to wind up throwing them away . 
on the plus side ,  it s a decent paperweight . 
and i ll probably go even higher once my current tube is finished . 
obviously i have some very damaged hair in these areas . 
anyway ,  more importantly is the high dust content in the litter . 
i have had this set out for about two weeks . 
frankly the original was not good either but much better than this . 
it is suppose to rock for  healing  split ends and adding moisture . 
do not buy this stock if you actually plan on shooting your shotgun . 
the slim fast product is rich ,  smooth ,  creamy ,  and delicious . 
the cheese wheel is more cardboard and little cheese . 
it is an odd textureleft my skin feeling sticky or tacky . 
these broke when i tried to place them around my ear . 
the first couple of times it worked well and i was excited . 
if they do i will revise my review . 
also ,  he doesn t like to play with it as a bone . 
the cover  front and back  of the cd holder bent in . 
it does not reach deep enough to make contact with the female jack . 
i really prefer the style of cod but this game was actually fun . 
when i first gave this to my kittens they just loved it . 
and frankly this is just a board game version of those two games . 
thought that it would work like a ever ready case . 
but i ordered a size num_num for my narrow size num_extend feet . 
if you want a true convection oven look elsewhere . 
for more advanced players ,  consider aluminum shafted darts with more weight . 
if i had it to do all over i would save my money . 
when i first applied itmy face burned and it made my eyes water . 
and pac man and some other games aswell . 
so much for trying to save some money and time . 
threw mine out a day after i got it . 
arrived quickly but the proximity sensor was bad and did not work . 
the timeless hla evaporated much more quickly than my previous hla . 
i have had other breeds that were much more obedient and train well . 
so yes its cheap but it doesn t work well at all . 
and the colour reminds me of when fake silver begins to turn black . 
it is just too difficult to figure out . 
i ll try again with something else perhaps not  natually fused  . 
i now have a pile of useless plastic junk . 
i gave it two stars just because i love the smell . 
considering those factors i would say its a bit overpriced . 
it s as if it detangled my hair for longer than i expected . 
the machine will turn on ,  but nothing will record . 
what an answer num_extend the device has upgrade compatability issues . 
you keep killing the same creatures over and over again . 
but we kept going expecting to find anything that resembled the photo . 
i have sensitive eyes when it comes to allergies . 
however after about num_num minutes ,  he walked away . 
that said ,  recoton at a low $ price should be fine . 
it costs a lot more ,  but also has other attachments and functions . 
i got this when i was feeling ballerific one day . 
i would not recommend this product at all . 
i will keep it and try harder ,  maybe try elsewhere . 
now the system is offline for all num_extend
the page didn t make it obvious these were tiny . 
boy these k cups are no good compared to my flavored beans . 
btw ,  their customer service leaves much to be desired . 
the thong part ripped right off one of the sandals . 
these are very pretty but are not comfy . 
most people are used to them salted and roasted . 
but it is long it covers your arms . 
the melissa and doug is that this one has storage underneath . 
unfortunately ,  i don t have the time nor the inclination to bother . 
plinking large items such as plastic bottles might work . 
they seem to be a heavier duty design . 
i used a different filter and i couldn t open the top . 
so ,  over the long term ,  it s more expensive to use . 
i thought the color looked great but the color was even inaccurate . 
three of them have chips around the edges . 
all you do is hit x and num_extend and repeat . 
the brew cycle only ran about an ounce of water before shutting off . 
if you wanted something permanent ,  this might not be it . 
it s so bad that i can t possibly eat it . 
bought the big box to be economical .  . bad choice . 
the product works as it did catch two fleas the first two days . 
bummereffects some :  it stopped working after about two months . 
not sturdy ,  doesn t adjust enough to fit all doors . 
this demonstrates both extremely poor quality control and indifferent customer service . 
external analog signals don t activate the recording level meter at all . 
i received this product and a large percentage of them burst . 
oz that this stuff helped people to lose weight . 
uniquely enough it was only my pikmin game that was causing problems . 
the lotion is really watery and it doesn t moisturize my skin . 
i had to save the game every num_num minutes . 
i tried them several times and each time became very uncomfortable and ill . 
on all three of them i bought ,  always the left speaker . 
brewer s yeast are high on selenium as well . 
case was mislead because the picture does not show the clips . 
it s only once in a while ,  but still annoying . 
sure it helps slow them a bit but it s not skid stop . 
run away fast from this terrible popcorn popper . 
it only holds the battery at the charge you plugged it in at . 
it s a continual problem i ve encountered with their fixed blade knives . 
num_extend star . edit num_extend well ,  the cats hate this stuff . 
this flea control product does not work to eliminate fleas on my yorky . 
the material was all bunchy and my boobs were just kinda drooping . 
the motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse . 
however the manufacture didnt get the location drilled right on their mount . 
i bought this because it s advertised as soft licorice . 
a shampoo and salt mixture which destroyed my hair . 
i pressed down and found that it was bowed . 
you have to go to the apple website and download it yourself . 
they also fall off faster than other brands i have used . 
i will never put one of these in my body again . 
the construction quality is decent with a very nice wood finish . 
maybe it was raining heavily and it malfunctioned . 
but ,  after using the tt my ends were frizzy ,  indicating damage . 
everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend . 
i do not recommend this headset to anyone . 
after using riovolt about a week ,  i regret buying it . 
for this model ,  the fit seems to be too snug . 
fits all of the others ,  but not the num_num model . 
this item did not come with the linksys install software . 
it halts the game and the sound stutters for about num_num seconds . 
unfortunetly ,  it will only heat to about num_num to num_num degrees . 
again ,  too bad madden signed his life over to ea sports . 
i tried this on my dad s eyebrows when i visited . 
wish i could find good ones so i can finally take pics . 
this is the worst ice cream scoop ever . 
i think it s the fuzzy tail that gets him . 
then the air tube had no bubbles but the disc was going great . 
it plays the same verse over and over and over again . 
danica chen has been doing some amazing research . 
i put it back in ,  but it popped right back out . 
it crashes way to much to get into . 
i think this could help people with extremely large and clogged pores . 
my son doesn t like the taste and neither do i . 
just really white and that was what i wanted . 
i have been around the block and continue to look for something better . 
the  deluxe  smartclip s light is difficult to use and very dim . 
i have multiple brands of cables and none of them stay in . 
amazon fit checks show that it would fit num_num lexus num_extend
traditional hard disks have num_num screw holes on each side . 
none of the smaller pockets is really large enough for accessories . 
it worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves . 
i have found better green concealers and am highly disappointed . 
the archs on the shots are off as well . 
this is a nice looking machine but kitchen aid has ignored quality control . 
i tried using silicone but it kept breaking the seal . 
it can only hold regular sized hard covered books . 
i liked the traditional soccer ball look and low price . 
i gave it less stars for the lack of life . 
otherwise ,  this glasses offer a great value for the price . 
i tried sharpening the cutter but this did not help . 
definitely won t do a good job filtering out larger particles . 
since i cannot return ,  i am giving these away . 
i cleaned the suction cup ,  cleaned the surfaces and nothing worked . 
that starts off fine ,  but eventually ,  they will leak . 
when i took these ,  i burped peppermint afterwards . 
they get as hot as you want  em to get . 
this is from all external appearances a great little puzzle . 
it is constructed okay and is a little light on the padding side . 
just don t know how you d keep dentures in place . 
i have been able to leave food in them for even num_num hrs . 
if you want a good football game ,  get madden num_extend
it ll look ok if not using a holster . 
spend more at local store and get the color you want . 
was ,  as other readers discovered ,  less than helpful . 
not sure why the ratings have been so high . 
i could now fit another person between the band gap and me . 
i have to hold it in place for a successful dialogue . 
however ,  i was disappointed with a few design flaws . 
i ve uninstalled this and said its really time to move on . 
the graphics are fantastic but who cares when the gameplay is lame . 
i will donate the three unopened boxes to our local food bank . 
it was cheap and now i know why . 
the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke . 
i do not intend to send this grain back you waste my time . 
don t make the same mistake as i did . 
the feathers come off in a day or two of play . 
the other item is what gives it its color ,  anthocyanins . 
this does not charge nearly as fast as the original . 
in fact ,  it s way too loud on our end . 
i sprinkled generously and it was salty tasting but not buttery . 
i am so glad i put it in a covered ,  plastic bucket . 
go to the now foods website and take a look for yourself . 
now it is too heavy and waxy for my thick curly hair . 
num_extend is notorious for having rf issues with all products . 
the quality was definitely impressive ,  but the style here was definitely not . 
it has no night vision capability beyond two small torches . 
i would rather pay more and have an item work . 
but geeez louise ,  kittens ,  i have my limits ! kthanxbai !  . 
my num_extend dog did not fit nor did my num_num lbs dog . 
so dimage num_extend owners ,  beware of this card . 
from afar ,  it sounds like rattling glass bottles on a shelf . 
we were lucky no one got burned or shocked . 
there is a major flaw in this product . 
it doesn t stay where it is supposed to stay . 
theres a gauge ,  everytime you use the form it drains the gauge . 
the over the ear holder is just plain ineffective . 
my commuter case for the fascinate has a nice feel to the buttons . 
and i noticed right away that it didn t cover all the fuschia . 
the bracket broke num_num days after installing it . 
as far as i know ,  playstation num_num is a waste of money . 
i m a big coffee drinker ,  and i loved illy issimo cappuccino . 
i found the taste and aftertaste to be more than a little offputting . 
i beg to differ with other positive reviews here . 
it looked like it promised to be so much fun . 
it is made very cheaply and does not justify its price . 
it is not compatible with mac ,  which others have reported . 
the dried vegetables seem to be the preferred bits . 
i m sure my leather loved it but but i didn t . 
i was under the impression these liners would prevent heel blisters . 
poorly done amazon; a first for me from them . 
best bet is to use the compression bags if room becomes an issue . 
the next practice session after the second magazine the front sight vanished . 
sometimes the toast won t stay down and there is no buzz . 
had to keep reapplying ,  i would get raccoon eyes ,  it smudges . 
it has this rubber piece that pressed into the skin between the toes . 
it leaves my hair hard ,  dry and there is no shine . 
it looked great and it looked like it would provide great protection . 
i should have paid more attention to the reviews . 
the only redeeming quality is it is cheap . 
i can not recommend this to any one . 
these also took a very long time arriving . 
the replacement also has tested with no continuity . 
i should have gone to a store if that s as the case . 
my camera has even some difficulty in sense this filter . 
i think i will stick to the ones made specifically for women . 
on any with a strict usb implementation ,  this does not meet it . 
overall ,  i would not recommend this toy to a friend . 
amazon is very good in their return process . 
get yourself at least a set of hoya filters . 
sure wish amazon would have been truthful with their description . 
i used frontline plus ever since it came out . 
the straps almost force the shoe off your foot . 
i won t complain about liquid concealers after trying this anymore . 
we thought that the taste was very good . 
i can t believe i wasted my $ on this garbage . 
i charged this battery upon receipt and used it the next day . 
bought these as favor boxes for my daughters birthday party . 
this looks cool but all of the crystals feel out . 
the tropical scenery creates an overall impressive atmosphere . 
when i unplugged this for the first time it came apart . 
it does not interfere with the perfume fragrance . now the folllowing num_extend
this crate ,  while very heavy and bulky ,  is extremely flimsy . 
it took me several minutes to get to a live person . 
you cannot use the psp in it easily either . 
i have tried everything to charge it and it will not run . 
it is a very nice pair of house slippers . 
i will find out later ,  if this phone working in australia . 
bag of puppy wellness treats costs $ in any pet store . 
lame story mode with too much time spent waiting and loading . 
in other words ,  this helicopter was extremely hard to maneuver or control . 
and if you mess up or something stupid happens . 
needless to say ,  we didn t leave him in the crate . 
one  of the two  new area is downright annoying . 
but when it arrived ,  it looked and felt cheap . 
does anyone check for the expiration date anyway ?  . 
after putting it on ,  it was exactly the same . 
it has % changed my hair and skin . 
i have num_num cats and not one would touch it . 
and the soap dries out my skin after two uses . 
the fabric is very thin and form fitting . 
i was looking for a gentle or tender slicker brush . 
the tabs constantly fell off and broke after only a few months . 
they should call the game shenmue :  chapter one . 
but my granddaughter scratched he tablet with one she used . 
nobody i ve played with has really enjoyed this game all that much . 
the lids on these are not microwavable safe . 
i have dropped my phone a few times while in this case . 
so reduce the usage to every other day . 
this product is by far the least usable . 
endless repetition of areas ,  tilesets ,  equipment and critters . 
i just bought this model and used it for only two times . 
i don t really know how to rate this item . 
i started using this and was initially happy with the results . 
i have used several different brands of dry apply screen protectors . 
this product is a good idea but didn t work out for me . 
but a week and a half later my skin is tight and even . 
i have reviewed three different flavors of switch . 
that loses a lot of appeal to me . 
superpet ,  we love your products ,  but this is a disappointment . 
doesn t  glimmer  or  shimmer  at all its flat black . 
the neck opening was too big as well as the arm openings . 
better toy for a dog than a cat . 
it s disappointing because it is a really good looking bag . 
the main character moves with ease and his moves are complex . 
overall i ve enjoyed it ,  and sometimes dreaded playing it . 
if that doesn t work it s back to sticky rollers . 
pretty much all of your game is beating up on things . 
seemed like refined coconut oil not extra virgin . 
i thought it would hold more than it did . 
will not work at all with any keyboard i have . 
instructions stated it should give me one extra bar of signal . 
they should just give us no powers or skills . 
i had to change her water bowls at least num_extend a day . 
my cockatoo turned up her beak at it . 
they are not for the current model mark xix . waste of money . 
very moist ,  not bad ,  but not worth the price . 
i have purchased num_num of these nesco dehydrators before . 
i had one of these and it began shorting within six months . 
i ve used now brand papaya enzymes successfully for years . 
first impression of the machine is that the thing is solidly built . 
my first attempt ,  i left it on for the full nine minutes . 
spend your hard earned money on something else . 
console gamers are getting ripped off if they put up with this . 
my num_num month old daughter loves it; as did my son growing up . 
ok ,  it s now num_num months after my purchase . 
i received num_num corn cups through amazon vine in a huge box . 
i just bought a replacement set of the sram bolts . 
out of the box is defective no signs of physical damage . 
i hate it and am frustrated with it . 
other than that this is a good starter tripod . 
the ingredients list says dried leek and onion powder . 
it tastes ok ,  but not great like before . 
it simply needs to add a diffused lighting to the keyboard . 
after putting it in my hair i just wanted to wash it out . 
and i don t feel like switching just to . 
tried in all possible ways but its just a waste of time . 
it will work for a bit ,  then mouse will mess up . 
the worst thing they screwed up was the research . 
didnt even get to reel in the line . 
but it came on time and it seems well made . 
don t do it ,  unless you want to be driven crazy . 
if any palm needed an update patch it s this one . 
it does make your hair soft but it isn t necessary . 
i will try to give it to a friend !  . 
safe your money and just buy organic produce . 
it also increase my acid reflux just a bit . 
again ,  another failed attempt at a racing game . 
we ll finish this bottle and find something else . 
well ,  i was this close to buy this game . 
wasn t the best baterry ,  but sure a better replacement . 
we were looking for the same sized replacement . 
i don t believe that these batteries are fresh . 
num_extend air ducts are also guarded this time . 
i wouldn t buy these for num_extend cents a bag . 
overall ,  the package reads like a desperate ploy . 
the package arrived in a bubble wrap mailer after almost num_num weeks . 
however ,  i now know that this product is not genuine . 
 it is not a  bra  that you can hide . 
i have a small head by the way . 
i asked for a replaecment ,  but in new condition as advertised . 
i just love to be a trend setter . 
i had to buy regular throw away batteries . 
i ended up getting a manual opener that does what it should . 
like others ,  followed the instructions to the letter . 
which is truly sad because the graphics in riven look amazing . 
they told me to send it in for repair . 
it was too many steps for her to handle . 
i got into the habit of using the phone . 
this tahini tastes nasty and i will never buy it again . 
otherwise ,  this toy would only get one star from me . 
was very disappointed ,  there was no real cheese flavor . 
i should have listened to the other reviews who wrote this item off . 
i gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning . 
it still shrinks up and leaves the tips of my nails exposed . 
they feel heavier and tighter than the num_extend
he barks whenever the doorbell rings ,  or someone pulls into the driveway . 
you re supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away . 
the peeple move better then the rok in my bak yard . 
i m so glad i rented this game instead of buying it . 
after much cleaning the images are now almost recognizable . 
so i ordered a num_num place settings  first num_num from amazon  . 
it s very disappointing because the trains themselves are awesome . 
we will try to fix it and see how it works then . 
i want my money back and cant contact the seller . 
this thing just crumbled in my hand while plugging it in . 
i love gopro but this bike mount is a super weak product . 
as the title says ,  it broke me out really bad . 
sorry to say this product did absolutely nothing for ant bite i received . 
it was a tight squeeze to get the batteries in . 
i do not pirate games ,  i have never downloaded one online . 
she actually has the nerve to say things like  jump over that wall  . 
like i said ,  i ve worn this for a long time . 
the first product has and install problem from the num_extend disk . 
this one left me wondering what happened to kershaw . 
i m not a big fan of this product . 
i had all my information saved on it . 
they should have kept a good thing going while they had the chance . 
this is truly a development that should put square enix to shame . 
shame on anyone who designed ,  manufactured and sells this death trap . 
not happy with this crappy item at all . 
it s too light to do anything productive with . 
one of the ends on the splitter cable did not work . 
each time i used it something on the unit fell apart . 
tried it a few times and threw it in the junk drawer . 
buy a product without the dye . better yet ,  just buy sugar . 
tip is history the minute you touch it . 
i hate mine because i did everything to remove it but couldtn t . 
now she is walking she hardly looks at this toy . 
i bought two of these ,  and each one lasted about one month . 
i don t feel good about feeding this to a child . 
i am certain this costume had been used and then resold . 
don t buy these unless you have legs like spongebob . 
if possible ,  get one with the apo designation on it . 
still reaches her back end with no problem whatsoever . 
it came apart when i plugged it in the car . 
however ,  my cat has destroyed the covering on the steps . 
it is an aftermarket product that is not very sturdy . 
doesn t provide much heat ,  but i m not gonna drink it . 
it doesn t work on a belt at all . 
it nearly put a hole in our kitchen ceiling . 
my old grinder top twisted on and i never had this problem . 
but the kiwi berry flavor was too sweet for me . 
this is a good product but too expensive for what u get . 
no more changing the ph balance with ash . 
 it was more like num_num feet ,  not num_num meters !   . 
i d rather pay more money for better quality food . 
this item is way to short in the handle . 
i m not at all impressed with the sound quality . 
given the numberof responses this can t be a fluke . 
i recommend the kitchenaid . kitchenaid num_extend blade coffee grinder ,  onyx black . 
i have had num_num of these now ,  of differing design . 
any decent smoothie would blow this away for nutrition . 
the recipe has totally changed and they tasted stale on top of that . 
mrs zack here !  this product increased in price by $ over night . 
mine lasted about num_num months before my thunderbolt started having power problems . 
while they were working ,  my wife loved them . 
and it made a grinding sound then locked up . 
i had it for less than a week . 
i just found out how to actually make it work . 
it is just an average quality ,  average performing knife . 
you can buy socks made in the usa .  february num_extend num_extend
i decided to buy the thundershirt to see if it would work . 
this game is not what i had expected . 
the labels only show the distribution location  usa  . 
and other things are slightly different on the battery . 
however ,  i cannot recommend it because of the lid . 
there is no tea in this product to ttaste . 
after that my hands and feet were completely dry . 
my original review i have left intact above . 
so i didn t expect this toy to last beyond that . 
 double sigh .   game options are also pretty bare . 
just a lazy manufacturer not finishing the painting job . 
i had recently purchased two perfumes from tuccini via amazon . com . 
well ,  you definitely get what you pay for . 
one of the grinders was hardly used being at a weekend lake home . 
been buying new balance since num_extend but will probably look elsewhere next time . 
i bought num_num sets ,  one arrived defective and i tossed it out . 
i do not like this product need to send it back . 
as a result ,  they now just ignore this item . 
eventually the water sneaks itself back in the darn goggles . 
looked like a good idea ,  but this just doesn t work . 
what if the tape is too light ?  that means error on num_extend
we had him under anesthesia for the cleaning . 
this makes her hard to play with and not as cuddy as woody . 
it s also very tightly coiled ,  which makes it harder to maneuver . 
fogged up ,  hurt my face ,  water got in . 
everything sounds very tinny and annoying ,  but not robotic or anything else . 
i can t tell you how much i regret buying these toys . 
i saw the reviews and figured it was a can t miss game . 
would strongly recommend the snackmaster brand over this one . 
chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks . 
get a smaller dart gun ,  like the maverick . 
the risk just doesn t outweigh the reward  !  . 
needless to say ,  the company sucks and so do the frownies . 
left my skin looking dirty ,  not sun kissed . 
looks good but dont trust your phone in this . 
it worked a little better but still didn t last long . 
overall i did not like and do not use . 
it works well with a flea comb ,  but it is more work . 
i purchased this to replace a well worn out camping knife . 
it had small scratches it rapidly aquired more . 
this was not apparent until you take the cover off . 
i tried it and after num_num bottles ,  i saw no results . 
ive only played the first parts and so far it seems bad . 
i don t like the bulky boom type headsets . 
if you are familiar and comfortable with paddles ,  you ll like it . 
until someone does ,  this will have to do . 
look over the list of ingredients and research them all . 
this is an xbox game and not made for pc playing . 
notice iguana who made the other two turok games  didnt make this one . 
i wouldn t even give these away for free to someone . 
it s way too sweet and has a weird taste . 
i used this product about num_num times before i was done with it . 
it s also easy to clean since the top piece is removable . 
i think it is the wood they are using . 
i ve been buying wildside salmon for years but no more . 
however ,  two things bother me about this num_extend
i had an older model vornado that was great . 
now ,  although the clock works ,  i can not see the time . 
i don t think this cleanser is for everyone . 
you must get item a from spot num_num to spot num_extend
this set looked promising and i was really looking forward to receiving it . 
it clumps ,  smears and is extremely difficult to apply . 
well ,  it s not bad the first week but unremarkable . 
the front and back do not match up ,  detail wise . 
that s the only problem i have with this item . 
then i got a rash from the shoulders up . 
each time within a month the plastic has cracked . 
please promise me you will never play this . 
my dachshund had the feet off in less then num_num min . 
i really dont believe its a new battery . 
we took him to the vet at num_extend
the band is too tight ,  the cups are too large . 
considering the cost ,  that may not be too bad . 
so it sits there brand new and unused . 
i tried to ignore it for about a week unsuccessfully . 
pretty disastrous failure if your e hunting for food . 
i love the short ,  but these are much smaller than advertised . 
keep in mind though ,  this product is rather obsolete . 
i am going back to bestbuy to return it . 
the whiteness fainted some but it is still there . 
i purchased this product to help my dog calm down around my cat . 
and that is where i made my mistake . 
i am not impressed at all with these . 
this one though doesn t live up to my expectations . 
i love yummy earth hard candy and i love gummy bears . 
its cheap and ya pay for what you get . 
the finish of the fabric had scratches on it too . 
it took like num_num minutes for him to close the door . 
for whatever reason ,  these had a strong musty  ,  or moldy odor . 
beautiful bold colors and it does cover down on your phone . 
why did i not shop amazon in the first place ?  . 
i assume there is no added sugar ,  which is a real plus . 
my son received this toy as a gift . 
i ve got two and i ve never had an issue with either . 
the part was defective one of the flex cables was too short . 
what is appalling is the design of the spout . 
i don t recommend this for any god damn gamer . 
upon receiving my parcel ,  it was an aqueon brand light . 
i ll be ordering more as they go so fast . 
this product made my hair have even more frizz . 
you cannot walk num_num steps withouht having to fight some weak monster . 
i was under the impression that it was something special . 
this was okay for a very short time . 
getting a little into the jrpg weeds here ,  but i can deal . 
this is an easy toy for your dog to get the food out . 
this casserole dish is designed to break ,  and it will eventually . 
so i shipped it back the next day . 
will probably return this new one and get the old model waterpik . 
and at $ per can ,  the price is just to high . 
it hurts when i used it on my nose hair . 
i ve found that hot water works better than this product . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
the sound quality is very poor with low volume and distorted high end . 
and the sign lost quality ,  remenber is a fm sign . 
the end result :  stale grinds the next time you use the machine . 
it finally stuck on num_num steps  down from nine thousand something  . 
they don t glow unless you are right next to the light . 
as someone else has written ,  this axe is a compromise . 
what s the point if it won t stay on the phone ?  . 
the second issue is the the material itself . 
and it weighed my hair to the extreme . 
i picked the regular fit and while im tall these were still long . 
i wonder if the manufacturer reads these reviews . 
this product was a complete waste of money for me . 
but in view of the price ,  i expected far ,  far more . 
i couldn t even finish the game due to lack of interest . 
clearly there are highly different revisions of this piece of equipment out there . 
it does a fine job for anyone but the fussy . 
maybe more units should be checked for quality control before leaving factory . 
you have to wait until you purchase the item and read the documentation . 
however ,  the rest of the game is another story . 
some of the scenery was done very well . 
i thought ,  what the heck ,  try this instead of new blades . 
my fingers were sore and nearly bruised after trying to remove this case . 
it has been replaced by far superior num_extend phones that cost less than $
i don t think they are supposed to smell sour . 
i am tired of fooling around with it . 
the matter was resolved and we were issued a refund . 
it was too short ,  too tight and unflattering . 
if you combine these the game does nothing but   .  .  .   constantly . 
it did sting a little when i put it on . 
i have bought both doggie chews and wrapped human pills in cheese . 
this is the only brand i have ever used . 
for night use ,  there should be a  blue  option . 
they are no use if i can t get them working . 
i recommend it to my obedience marker training clients . 
do not waste your money on this game . 
in a giant brown pill sort of way . 
i have to say ,  i feel the same way about it . 
first off ,  i am not a sony hater . 
the cans wouldn t stack properly in the cupboard . 
if you want a large selection on songs ,  riovolt is better . 
i thought this was the best bra for me . 
now it doesn t show up in the bios . 
i wish they made these with a harder rubber . 
i give them two stars because of the handy bag they come in . 
this wax did not touch the majority of hair on my upper lip . 
it s ugly and way too colourful like most hamster cages and num_extend
i would rate this item as zero stars if i could . 
even the optical repair kit did not have anything suitable . 
but there is no centralized display of colony status . 
the controls are nice ,  but the gameplay sux . 
if amazon was willing to do that they d have my business . 
if you peel back the paper ,  they just fall apart . 
i had much ,  much better luck with triderma md rosacea repair cream . 
i expected better performance than this unit delivers . 
back to my old faithful brand ,  will never stray again . 
the lg env touch is an awful phone . 
however ,  the shoddy frame rate and unresponsive controls leave it wanting . 
we sent it back and got our money back . 
in fact ,  anytime after a week usually results in inedible cereal . 
someone shorter might wind up with them fitting around their armpits . 
but i took it off when i saw that it was peeling . 
no ,  you end up with a melted mess about num_extend inches long . 
i think he may have used it one other time . 
if you get a response wrong ,  you must repeat sections . 
countless calls to customer service and repair service have had no effect . 
i purchased this from oem planet through amazon . 
there isn t any story in the whole game . 
if you are working around other things it can be bumped . 
it also gives my face a smooth ,  flawless finish . 
i honestly do not see what everyone else does in this game . 
when the amount is that low expect bad results . 
i had high expectations for this product given the sennheiser brand . 
when i stopped ,  there was no difference in how i felt . 
i ordered some of these and really don t wear them . 
i am looking for something else which actually works . 
this was just the wrong cable for my nook color . 
it clumps ok ,  but is not very effective for controlling odor . 
the hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges . 
but i guess the power supply in the base died or shorted out . 
midwest lists this as the better model than their icrate . 
you try to repair that and another piece falls off . 
the animations for the cities as well as the industries are bland . 
i had to replace the batteries on a weekly basis . 
none of my num_num cats had any interest in this toy . 
she grew up and now she s a great warrior . 
fell apart with in a couple of weeks . 
but it is way too heavy for what i thought it would be . 
it would certainly not be cost effective to use in baking . 
but as soon as i moved it stopped working again . 
so i bought this kichenaid blender and the little kitchaid food chopper . 
which is what i will probably end up doing . 
the seal comes apart very easily and is not waterproof at all . 
the manuals say that they re for component video . 
i sincerely was not trying to beat the clock . 
it wouldn t work for me which could of been a defective scanner . 
it has almost no power and awkward to use . 
from there it did not agree with my system . 
then i tried it for the turkey bake . 
i tried to super glue it on ,  but it didn t work . 
it was designed that way to be portable . 
nothing in the game seems to use the dog . 
page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast . 
i ended up giving it to a body builder friend of mine . 
did not take time to try to return as it was a hassle . 
not many places to save without going back in num_extend
if you have carpal tunnel syndrome you ll feel it quick . 
stuff is cheap and seems not to last very long . 
i knew the scissors would be small and they are ,  very . 
ok ,  so i figure maybe it needs batteries . 
for those who had eye redness ,  i had that my first day . 
i purchased this product earlier this week from my local big box store . 
this time i applied a teeny ,  tiny mount before bedtime . 
usually i write reviews to rave about things i like . 
all he wants to do is to throw them down the steps . 
i select two star because this package was no good at all . 
he fell out of it more than once . 
however ,  npcs should never be more interesting that the main characters . 
worst experience i have ever had with dishwasher detergent . 
i returned mine the next day after i got it . 
no browsing ,  no phone dialing or receive functions . 
and mrs potato head can t even really stand properly without falling over . 
it happened while i was listening to a recorded book from my ipad . 
karateka and prince of persia were the two games i grew up on . 
there not as good as they look on this site . 
the chocolate was good but the cookie part was not . 
needless to say the seller is going to get a negative review . 
i usually choose from a variety of the higher quality cat foods . 
my whole family hated the taste of it . 
was a very weak version of liquid zinc . 
sometimes more towards strawberry blonde ,  sometimes more copper ,  sometimes more red num_extend
then the carry handle ripped right out of the mounting point . 
if you are thin then go ahead and order a num_extend
i used this as a substitute while working out . 
enemies such as the stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details . 
because they are everlast ,  i thought they would be good . 
if they do the task then you get their beads . 
they also have a wide range of colors . 
i actually discovered how great these inexpensive conditioners were . 
it didn t work in my num_num saturn oem stereo . 
it arrived promptly ,  and the kids immediately started playing . 
the blueberry part definitely doesn t taste like blueberry . 
kadadyn carbon packets in the past were vacuumed sealed . 
and if you tighten it too loose it also fails . 
it states on the label % natural calcium benotine  green clay  . 
it s like the scope is possessed by the devil or something . 
as long as i am standing and not moving ,  they are fine . 
this goes to show how different everybody s taste is . 
this  gold tone  filter is ok for some people i suppose . 
it does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills . 
i won t be buying chinese breakfast tea again . 
and as for  sound stage  ,  there was none . 
if your spending anything over num_num dollars dont consider buying this game . 
this case didn t fit my phone as well as it should have . 
this game is very original with good graphics . 
i think the next time i ll buy japanese . 
the axe whatever messy look is like putting cooking oil in your hair . 
i have encouraged him and he hates it . 
i believe it is a very good brand ,  it has everything . 
wrong !  i stopped the gelatin and cramps and pain continued . 
i am using a proline dsl router ,  from my local carrier . 
this small hatchet seems to have a lot going for it . 
this brush is oddly thick ,  doesn t blend well at all . 
they opened and closed the curtains with a long cord channeled over pulleys . 
if i connect the monitor directly to the computer the issue goes away . 
maybe its the organic thing but it s not for me . 
what about that huge blood mess you made on the ground . 
i ordered to my height and weight but it way too small . 
i thought maybe i didn t do it right and tried it again . 
the random map games are great . the animation is stunning . 
you can t wear it as an outfit because it ll be ugly . 
it is nowhere near the quality of the legendary otterbox brand cases . 
combat was interesting ,  but got old real fast . 
only then will it be a decent game . 
these are great jeans if you are sent the correct size . 
it only gets one star because it looks real . 
if not ,  i guess he could take a saw to the plastic . 
not really happy with the cleaning cloth they provided . 
despite the claims ,  this device would not work in my xp computer . 
i think this was a waste of money . 
i consume after any meal since it helps digestion . 
but it started taking longer and longer to make my cofee . 
these brands are ,  in my opinion ,  the best in the business . 
the company refunded the price of the broken one . 
suggest going to another seller or purchase directly fromt he store . 
if you re thinking about boiling water in this . 
the weapons are alright ,  i love just pounding guys with missles . 
i have always used a deep repair mask from the loreal products . 
the bra just folded over itself and followed that shape . 
probably best for wide calves so they will stay up . 
as i was watching my tv power suddenly went away . 
i also like sorters with more than num_num shapes . 
this case lasted for a little over a month with light use . 
no big rains to wash it away either . 
my girls both had no interest in this one . 
this game is the worst of all rpg s . 
this did not engage my child at all . 
these are cheap ,  cheap cheap in all aspects . 
turns out the stick on was right on . 
it s like the moisture has been sucked out . 
there are other units out there that handle this situation the correct way . 
i love weleda products ,  as they are all natural and high quality . 
i bought num_num of this product back in may num_extend
this stuff is pretty weak with the mint end of things . 
it returned to normal as soon as i stopped giving it to her . 
devil may cry num_num will be better than this . 
i will use the rest of my pound of honeybush to dye fabric . 
 eta :  and my account was credited on friday .   . 
a copper deficiency can cause painful nerve damage . 
this thing once installed has never worked right . 
num_num for a birthday gift and i was repulsed by it s smell . 
what else can you buy for that price ?  . 
num_num to num_extend this game might ve been acceptable . 
works fine as a basic set of earphones . 
all the time you will be under civilian penalty . 
i skipped the last exercise altogether because i was completely spent . 
when i turn my computer on ,  i expect to hear sound . 
it kind of just sat on top of my skin . 
all had stroboframe header cards and locating pins . 
this product didnt do justice to me like i hear every raving about . 
save your money for a game worthy of the $ price tag . 
sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun . 
and you can not track your items with this company . 
these white strips had hurt my teeth and made my gums white . 
it s nearly impossible to clean it properly because of that . 
they work ok ,  we use them for body trimming . 
i purchased the charger with a set and an additional set . 
i picked up this set at a local department store . 
thank god it didn t scratch the aluminium on the case . 
my mother ,  who wears a size num_extend fit into them perfectly . 
the tattoos are colorful and fun with lots of images to choose from . 
i feel as if i wasted my money . 
you are wrong .  .  . no heat for living food try . 
the package i received contained a pair of fishnets . 
as a veterinarian ,  i would advise against purchasing this product . 
it does leak when you pour no matter what . 
but ,  you end up stopping constantly to reload the pot . 
bought two of these and neither one pointed in the same direction . 
this brand of stevia was recommended by a number of posters online . 
it did nothing for my depression but i managed to clean the sink . 
i felt like throwin  this game in the toilet . 
the graphics of games on both the num_num vs . 
but now ,  they changed over to third person . 
there is no long term benefits to using this product . 
good concept but it is so hard to open . 
it took me num_num days to get it working with a sony vaio . 
i m sure a young teen will enjoy the . 
he did enjoy playing in the box it came in . 
i place boiled water in a bowl and inhale the steam . 
they are fine for drip coffee i am sure . 
i had a lee auto prime that lasted me num_num years . 
after a few months ,  the ear pads come apart at the seams . 
i bought it to remove the back of my watch . 
the only thing i liked ,  was the wide back closure . 
could someone please maybe give me some pointers ?  ?  ?  . 
why ?  because this puzzle is not solid wood . 
had to use a air compression machine  which they say not to  . 
no animal should have to eat mercury or pcb tainted salmon oil . 
it seemed much too short for num_num feet . 
this game is sooo boring and the same as halo num_num and num_extend
the sound is good and it s very comfortable . 
very nice quality shoe for the right person . 
i use the plastic cap to press the wax down . 
okay ,  i like the  small  size of the kibble . 
we ll review the num_num gba title and then  metroid  itself . 
no matter how slow you try to pour ,  it spills all over . 
picture playback is what it should really be all about . 
the smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell . 
this was recommended to me by sephora and i totally hated it . 
i threw it in the trash ,  i couldn t stand the scent . 
the actual product ,  however ,  is more like a soft black . 
i needed another basket because the first one started coming apart . 
i ended up getting a blister on my leg after the first run . 
they do offer great upgrades for their products ,  free . 
even the slighted nudge knocks the pieces out of place . 
sometimes every bump i hit on the road would keep setting it off . 
some maps are hard to beat even on the easiest setting . 
and i exfoliate my skin num_extend it is unnaturally matte . 
sums it up . this belt feels like a cotton wrapped cardboard . 
my initial experience was very good and the product performed as advertised . 
norelco doesn t put out the quality that it used to . 
i have not noticed any difference; the oil is still there . 
also ,  bills get clogged up in the right side of the drawer . 
would not recommend this product under any circumstances . 
clearly ,  this product was manufactured for wilma flintstone . 
i don t recommend these at all !  only stating the truth . 
he is a bit shy and did not seem to like this . 
to begin with the tweezers are cheap plastic and don t even work . 
i see where this camera is selling used for $
both times ,  it happened when i was on vacation . 
i refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it . 
they told me to slap the container against my palm about ten times . 
i gave it two stars because of the presentation of this toaster . 
hard ,  not soft and chewy like it should be . 
it continues to play ,  but i can t turn it off . 
i really wish it fit better because i love the color . 
i emailed them again for a refund ,  which they promptly did . 
i use it when i have to ,  definitely not everyday . 
the smell filled all the rooms of my apartment for several days . 
they are well built ,  a bit heavy but can take a beating . 
they were cute and i received many compliments but very heavy and clunky . 
i would look elsewhere for a better product . 
two other family members had the same issue . 
not sure what all the raves are about . 
pay a bit more and get a far superior product that is lasting . 
this is a cheap sales ploy with no real medical proof . 
try it yourself you will find this out for yourself . 
the pounding of your heart isn t from terror . 
this review is based on her liking of the game . 
this item is not like the original corningware . 
at least ,  i m not very comfortable using it . 
my mom used these colours to make my birthday cake . 
in this case ,  it is the standard  comic mischief  and some wiggling . 
will give an update on whether storing the cakes makes a difference . 
please save your money and buy something better . 
so i decided to give a different shampoo of organix a try . 
this black and decker dual line trimmer works well enough . 
it was far too large for my dog . 
windows interacts with this device in ways that are particularly annoying to me . 
my dog doesn t really like to eat it . 
this one came in plastic bag with a couple of attachments . 
the screen light kept flickering then after num_num seconds didn t light up . 
it cost too much to return it so i kept it . 
i usually love how true the colors turn out ,  and how consistent . 
i enjoyed the leveling up and appreciated each character s diverse weaponry . 
after the grill cooled off ,  i went to clean it . 
it split along a seam; the catnip spilled out; the cat was done . 
the plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover . 
she was so careful taking it out of the box . 
when it arrived i went and installed it first thing . 
i ordered speculums in small ,  medium ,  and large . 
this screen protector was not a match for the tab num_extend
i ve bought num_num of these including num_num refills  not all at once  . 
couldn t wait to get home and wash it off my wrist . 
it gets under my screen saver and makes a bubble . 
it only seems expensive ,  because you re getting so much . 
just another product for sale to separate pet owners from their money . 
so ,  overall ,  i am displeased with the product . 
they re going to do plenty of that when they get older . 
it hurts my hands just to crush one pill . 
it was too easy to beat and did it in less than num_extend
for the price i can t be too disappointed . 
i m guessing the micro usb connector went inop . 
a friend gave me money to order this for him . 
it was very uncomfortable and i had to return it . 
they smelled really bad ,  some of the coating looked a little greenish . 
it changes the voice but not enough to make it a cool toy . 
after i get my color treated hair and keratin treatment . 
my cats either wiggle out of it or manage to snap it open . 
it throws a very even ,  very white light at two intensities . 
i purchased this item thinking i was getting one of the best . 
i have had this filter for over a year . 
you can carry only very limited amount of items . 
this crate did not stand up to my dog . 
later on ,  i cancelled this order after reading the comments . 
lecithin is a fatty substance that is extracted either chemically or mechanically . 
unfortunately ,  the quality goes along with the price . 
after one more wash it was too small . 
still ,  i wish this possibility was mentioned by pny in their documentation . 
there is a hard metal decal where your hand holds the scoop . 
it appears that haggar has gone all the way with this product . 
it dried sticky ,  and this caused me to be very itchy . 
i ll stick to the lance or austin brands for future purchases . 
there is no wire or anything inside it to attach it with . 
this is the right idea ,  but horrible at execution . 
but it just did not work for me !  . 
but after not too long it starts to get very repetitive . 
first off ,  i broke a nail trying to get the box open . 
my father bought a new num_extend for me for a graduation present in num_extend
i had no other pads installed  other than what came with unit  . 
you might as well just pour mouthwash down there . 
our cats had zero reaction for this stuff . 
i should have save up to buy a vitamix instead . 
not sure why ,  but the mike doesn t work . 
migraines ,  as with many chronic illnesses ,  can have multiple triggers . 
funny thing about this product ,  it caused me to have insomnia . 
i tested this product on my arms for a week . 
ordered and item failed to work as advertised . 
tried multiple times and in multiple different ways . 
i have never worn a bluetooth in my right ear . 
out of num_num people ,  not a one said clean or fresh . 
i wouldn t recommend this product as a wrinkle treatment . 
this game is okay at first ,  but then it gets boring . 
i added pictures to amazon if you want to know what i got . 
when traveling in rural areas ,  data is impossible to find . 
they just look at it curiously and ignore it . 
you kill a knight and turn off the quake control . 
i have tried several times and tried putting product in my hair first . 
i guess the small covered pan might be useful for other purposes . 
ive had two of these ,  paid $ each at apple store . 
i dont think this dock is for iphone . 
the belkin tunecast ii fm transmitter is a complete nightmare . 
but well worth num_num stars for the price . 
i am so sorry that it s not good for me . 
maybe someone will designa better one maybe ones used for cats . 
i can t wait to get this game over with . 
i purchased this item from sears and thought it would work . 
after looking it over ,  and thinking about it . 
oz but did he actually try it himself ?  . 
given how much it costs ,  i was disappointed . 
i thought with it being wood it would be a good quality toy . 
several months ago ,  i started having problems with internet connectivity . 
for a smaller frame ,  it might do very well . 
this by far the worse fighting game ever . 
it gives an excellent company a bad rap . 
it does not look expensive ,  and at $  us  it is not . 
while it was brewing it didn t smell much like coffee either . 
i will purchase the glossing cream from amazon now . 
it does its job and is just the right size for a bedroom . 
too bad i didn t end up liking the product . 
wait till november and the num_extend will be in your hands !  . 
after some ten minutes ,  i decided to take it out . 
i work primarily with dell gx series computers with usb keyboards and mice . 
i had a bottle of seche vite a while back . 
if you dont have num_num controllers this game is even more stupid . 
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my wife . 
didn t work ,  made a mess ,  was completely and utterly ineffective . 
i spent time on the phone with a fitting consultant . 
doesn t even come close to accomplishing the same thing . 
however ,  i tried something that rendered the berries much more palatable . 
when the light comes on sometimes it goes green  charged  almost immediately . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
i stopped at the middle of chapter num_num and dont intent to continue . 
my husband and friends all complain about the way i smell . 
i use it a couple of time till it broke . 
hard core fans of hunters would definitely bark at me for this one . 
and it gives you about a dozen constellations and a description of each . 
petroleum jelly is a better alternative  in my case  . 
take games like sim city and the sims for example . 
my two large breeds puppies hated this food . 
this item was to small to fit into a num_extend socket . 
and the phone is too heavy to lean on the flip up lid . 
takes some getting used to but not for me . 
i could do better with a piece of hard stream bedrock . 
shadows and particles may have increased ,  but characters  and equipment  have not . 
some people might be extremely allergic to it . 
tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results . 
it might be because i m not a hard cored gamer . 
instead ,  it just made her loopy for about num_num minutes . 
when i disconnected the adapter it was very hot to the touch . 
i will never use any crest product again . 
i don t care ,  i want a crepe pan . 
i did not take it with me when i moved abroad . 
i just put one of these on my rear tire yesterday . 
perhaps i should have bought the kitty interactive feeder  tubes  . 
try doing web searches on this subject if it concerns you too . 
now i absolutely would not recommend this product to anybody . 
therefore ,  not good for use in an indoor space . 
we have been a fan of seventh generation products for several months . 
right in the garbage they will go . not recommended  :   . 
it was very foamy from the carbonation it creates . 
this product is superbly engineered ,  but the implementation sabotages the entire experience . 
when this dvd player was working ,  it worked well . 
if you need a half and half coffee this would work . 
at first ,  this seems like a good product . 
maybe the trick is to only use it every num_num weeks . 
it s not as if this story couldn t have worked . 
i find it very uncomfortable when it does my whole back . 
when it was sent the antenna box was not taped . 
my health warrants that i monitor it closely . 
today ,  i had a day off and decided to mow the lawn . 
perhaps it works for them ,  but i hate it . 
it make it feel thicker but alot of other products do that . 
i could have gotten few $ cheaper at different site . 
it is stiff and hard to get out of the jar . 
i also own the  big sexy hair  texturizing powder . 
unfortunately this one is a dud !  the front door will not latch . 
they said it does in caption ,  but does not fit . 
i can be a blonde and i freely admit this . 
i don t think the breville s performance is worth the extra expense . 
i should have done so a long time ago . 
trust me when i say this game is weak . 
the colors that are intact look pretty though !  . 
i just thought the liners might be different . 
i ordered this pair of slippers because reviews said it ran small . 
i gave the ball to our local shelter . 
isolyze comes in num_num or num_num different flavors . 
both upon my first and second bites . the product is edible . 
maybe i got a used battery god knows . 
it did seen to help initially but no long term solution or cure . 
for the price ,  i was expecting something a lot sturdier . 
i took the collar off and brought my dog into the house . 
the design of factions makes playing it a chore . 
over time i noticed this did nothing for me . 
the  bosses  i fought in this game are hardly worth mentioning . 
if it s not the build quality ,  it s the software . 
i got this for my husband ,  who is prone to razor bumps . 
they do not match up to the picture shown . 
people will glare if you want to show them something on your phone . 
i don t know hhhhowww people could give it a positive review . 
it came off rather quickly and transferred onto my chair . 
this lotion is so very expensive that i expected something different . 
great concept but it could have been a lot better . 
i purchased this item based on many reviews . 
i have bought many socks through the years . 
this cereal reminded me a lot of quaker s oh s . 
it arrived very fast ,  so nothing bad to say there . 
use it only if you know what you re doing . 
not when they take forever just to get through . 
who takes three shots and then recharges the battery ?  not me . 
i am getting tired of products not being as described . 
purchased two packs of these stakes from amazon . 
my female just didn t get this toy at all and walked away . 
why anyone would need this is beyond me . 
you name it ,  and it did it all . 
however ,  the taste of this drink was downright weird and nasty . 
but in fire emblem dying forever is just as easy as drinking water . 
sorry gelish ,  this color is a no go . 
i am disappointed about the clip and wouldn t recommend it . 
the slightest movement causes the strings to num_extend
these crayons cost a pretty penny and we think we are getting beeswax . 
the next couple of days it worked alright and then stopped ,  altogether . 
they are absolutely the best way to wash and wax your car . 
changing players take to long so good sacks are rare . 
there are just too many things to list . 
it is slower than old version of internet explorer . 
i suffer from chronic migraines ,  so i gave this product a try . 
i am very disappointed thinking they would make safer products than this . 
cheaply made and stopped working after a couple weeks . 
it left my hair kind of clumpy and sticky . 
i would recommend testing this lens out before purchasing . 
i just threw it away as its too costly to send back . 
i think this game sucks and is a waste of money . 
despite their appearance ,  they really are not well designed for active people . 
still looking for the best nursing bra for my needs . 
the blades are badly designed and do not blend the contents at all . 
i am just waiting for this to break . 
likely a little more expensive and without bluetooth capabilities . 
after days the paint chipped so much that it took flowers off . 
what you want is  general purpose  and this is not it . 
i thought that he would like to see how this toy worked . 
this was purchased to replace an num_num quart aluminum presto . 
i was concerned about the materials used for this toy . 
it is not effective in squeezing a tube of toothpaste . 
the last thing it did was help any anxiety . 
i didn t even feel it slip off my ears . 
a waste of time and money for cats and dogs . 
only the low setting is available but when i used it in russia . 
i like solgar products but this one didn t do it for me . 
my toddler daughter is thin and small for her age . 
that is the end of the good news . 
the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect . 
i tried to superglue it back together ,  but to no avail . 
not the quality you would expect from hanes . 
freaking loud and you can t turn it down . 
i read all the reviews and decided to try . 
my daughter got this as a gift for a dollhouse we made . 
i thought i was going to love this product but didn t . 
now just another inanimate toy the cats ignore . 
that flaw alone negates the reason i bought this . 
you can read back issues in your library . 
can t see how they can stay in business like this !  . 
battery is a little better ,  but not really . 
nothing ,  and i mean nothing ,  would counteract that . 
first shipment came with accessories and no dock . 
i really liked the color but it dried out my lips . 
i ve seen much more believable cz than this in the stores . 
mealy or gummy depending on how you use it . 
i will be reluctantly getting my num_extend q  replacement  . 
best visit library and then internet to obtain suitable materials to make slides . 
again nothing ,  seriously it was like i never used the anise . 
the decription says   one size fits all  . 
it provided extended life for a few days only . 
i just have really dry skin i guess . 
the best by far over the years had been the scunci velvet ones . 
now ,  when i grew up i played mostly with k nex . 
these shirts were a great disappointment for me . 
didn t look that great for my face shape . 
overall this product works on my num_extend itouch and num_num and num_extend ipod . 
you can see where the missing spoke was welded ,  but fell off . 
and now the desk cradle stopped charging batteries . 
much like many of the other reviews ,  i received old stock batteries . 
i m glad i spent so little on this gadget . 
i experienced frequent lost of communication between the monitor and the belt . 
the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself ,  also doesnt allow returns . 
easy and convenient ,  you can get plenty out of each container . 
many people use a regular coffee maker ,  but mate needs num_extend water . 
came with an impossible to remove hair pre installed for my inconvenience . 
i read the other reviews but decided to give this a try anyway . 
that should have been the first thing they implemented into this design . 
he wa sthrilled to see it ynder the tree . 
we have come to expect more from you . 
i have to crush and mix them because i have trouble swallowing . 
i didn t taste or even smell a hint of hazelnut in this . 
not hispanic ,  don t understand it so pointless for me . 
i can get less aggravated for less money just about anyplace . 
she d rather drink the mud water at the doggie park than this . 
i think those taste even more fake ,  and much too sweet . 
num_num pieces sound like many ,  but most are tiny pieces . 
looks nice and fits my num_num pound yorkie well . 
they also stuck to a fair amount of cakes . 
for this i am downgrading my rating to only num_num stars . 
my son still cries because he got frustrated so many times . 
it is basically always the same tune ,  with some variations . 
it was more of a chemical smell than refreshing cucumber . 
i loved this eyeliner ,  until i had to sharpen it . 
personally though ,  i take my food a little more seriously . 
it shouldn t even be considered an accessory at all . 
the pain seemed worth it for amazingly smooth legs . 
need much more coffee to gate a full bodied flavor . 
it broke on me after less than a year . 
i should be thankful i only paid $
it s simply a game where you walk around slashing everything in sight . 
so ,  i just got this yesterday and was all jazzed about it . 
i threw them out as it wasn t worth the hassle of returning . 
standby up to num_num months ,  talk time up to num_num num_extend
i have always used creamy vanilla isopure and loved it . 
trust me and make the investment and buy the more expensive ones . 
hard to apply unlike the liquid spray bottle ones . 
save your money and a better one it stopped working on me . 
when it does this you notice the game chugging real hard . 
there is no protection from bumps or falls . 
the controls are hard to get used to . 
i need a hearing aid to hear this in the other room . 
perhaps that s why everyone is getting such marvelous results . 
i wouldn t purchase it if i had the choice . katiebabs . 
but this is definitely not for sensitive skin . 
get this ,  it s reset after every level rendering your efforts worthless . 
somehow the little staircase traps the loose litter before they leave the box . 
but after num_num months ,  the learning feature stop working . 
then i investigated and discovered the chicken was from china . 
the first num_extend i owned worked extremely well for about num_num years . 
the guns didn t work most came in broken . 
when i got the gun i could tell it was cheep . 
l purchased this polarizing lens but returned it today for a refund . 
i ve used nubian heritage black soap and really liked it . 
i ordered these headphones expecting sennheisers smooth sound and comfortable fit . 
there may be an obstruction or security zones added . 
too small and they ripped at the seems on the first wear . 
the problem is ,  no one sells the num_extend version num_extend
the dimensions are given ,  but the usable space is small . 
these shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe . 
maybe i ll try them again in a few months . 
after he took the glue off it works . 
there is nothing in it to bend it to hold any shape . 
this is without a doubt the worst vacuum i ve ever owned . 
it is very loose and cannot be properly adjusted . 
the graphics and sound and the best yet . 
i tried different ports ,  different micro usb cords ,  everything . 
but after that i couldn t get anymore color out of it . 
the controller lacked several things that is neccesary to a num_extend controller . 
i was disappointed and had to send it back . 
look for higher quality alternatives or wear a helmet !  . 
my next flat iron will be a chi . 
dead or alive num_num continues this tradition wholeheartedly . 
they are smaller than i thought ,  and the center is hard . 
there s no way that the company didn t know about this . 
the cup is great !  !  the holder is not . 
i stopped using it after a month or so . 
this trainer is not compatible with my burley canto recumbent . 
i was able to back up all my data to my nes array . 
it was hassle all around ,  dealing with this product . 
something like icy hot is much more effective . 
i may use the rest of it in some of my recipes . 
very flimsy and not easy on the eyes either . 
it s too hard to get immobile toes manipulated into the toe spaces . 
thats all i have to say for this product . 
ironically ,  they ve never behaved like that in the car before . 
so baby went to bed and had a little pep left . 
i got this because i needed a strapless bra . 
it actually tastes like rancid milk once prepared and is totally % inedible . 
i ll probably just rent a rug doctor a few times a year . 
i had to guess at the size since it was not stated . 
in my grocery store the stevia in the raw was cheaper . 
do your feet a favor and steer clear of these abf flops . 
now if i wanted to position it landscape style it would work perfectly . 
the poor dogs were scratching all the time . 
the ramp is separate pieces that you have to put together . 
this is for a powermac num_extend or so the label says . 
when we received these arm floats only one would inflate . 
i felt like it did it for the first washing . 
it is the worst game i have ever played . 
a few came broken with no way to fix . 
please try again at a later time ,   or  we re sorry . 
the sticking part is particularly true for leafy vegetables . 
num_num star because she can see her self dance to the music . 
there s an achievement for playing a certain number of hours . 
they love the sweet potato treats so i thought i would try these . 
these headphones really want to slide off my head . 
if i am limited to num_num installs what do i do then . 
the fabric on this one was extremely thin as well . 
the same sweetness and flavor doesn t even compare . 
but that s pretty much it . the story is throwaway . 
the size of the slots is shorter and shallower than it should be . 
i will update if they contact me and try to resolve this matter . 
i spoiled the entire game for you right there . 
however ,  this product literally doesn t do half of what it advertises . 
this product has the worst antenna connection i have ever seen . 
that is just three milimeters fewer than the classic . 
too expensive for a small diary with a pad lock !  . 
it works ,  just not good for your body in the long run . 
the sandals pinch between toes and are not comfortable . 
either treat us right or have us not buy your product . 
it doesn t clump well and there is no odor control . 
the num_extend simply doesn t meet any of those standards . 
i had to order another cover to replace it . 
i don t think the limitation of this recorder justifies the price . 
probably the most linear rpg created in the past num_num years . 
the scars are still there and i haven t worn the shoes since . 
i made a mess trying to paint my nails . 
wasted $ plus shipping and a few kilograms of num_extend in the atmosphere . 
here is the ingredients and i hope it helps . 
skip it !  maybe a different brand will be better . 
knowing that this product was only $ i didn t have high expectations . 
it has an interior space you can put things in . 
i shudder to think what gatorade s idea of  strawberry  might taste like . 
after about an hour of use the batteries need to be changed . 
this is very gassy with not much results . 
i couldn t handle the smell ,  i had to give it away . 
the earbuds broke after a week so i do not recommend . 
it isn t snug or even close to snug around my ankle area . 
again the smell is lovely but not worth the money for no bubbles . 
i saw no change other than dialing back my appetite . 
these lights indicate a hardware failure and this has been reported numerous times . 
the static only exists when the volume is deafening . 
still no reception so guess the num_extend is shot . 
just move from place to place and kill things . 
these panties did not have a size selection . 
i still get all the litter around it . 
will say it did hold the phone very securely until it stops sticking . 
build quality of all the filters is really not very good . 
i was going to order more online ,  but it s too expensive . 
a good example occurs on the first mission . 
it now just shows up as a generic num_extend
it s very cold in my kitchen as a result . 
totally simple upright docking station for my overcrowded desk . 
another person in the family likens it to bathroom cleanser . 
it s just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance . 
this is their reply :  dear david , thank you for your email . 
iwork num_extend reads and writes to word ,  excel and powerpoint . 
this is the most annoying toy my daughter owns . 
it makes it better protection that this bulky plastic casing . 
this battery left me hanging in tempe az while i was using gps . 
when i first got my kodak num_extend camera ,  i was pretty happy . 
rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored . 
it was a gift and now i ve to buy another thing . 
i purchased a rabbit when it first came out ,  and loved it . 
i will be contacting the better business bureau immediately . 
but way overpriced and the inscent repellent doesn t work at all . 
they are dry and did not taste good to me . 
the bottom flap just locks together to hold the phone secure inside . 
do not order if you wanted the colors pictured . 
added room temperature water with dechlorination and slime coat additive . 
the first time i used this product ,  i saw no change . 
i received this camera new the other day . 
i have contacted trendnet support with no response . 
guess this goes into my drawer of broken electronics . 
you get what you pay for i suppose . 
with this experience ,  i contacted amazon and arranged a return . 
it s not intuitive and complicated to set up . 
when i first received this product i was ecstatic . 
in any case ,  it was still fun for an unchanllenging game . 
the seams give too easily most never were seamed . 
this has got to be the worst of them all . 
i rented this game and thought it was crap . 
i look at the label and it say compatible with ipod num_extend
do yourself a freakin favor and avoid this coffee maker !  !  !  . 
the areas are all so illogically layed out . 
it was surgically debrided and vetericyn is not helping . 
num_num seconds on your checks and num_num seconds on your nose and chin . 
i realize they can be damaged by heat . 
i don t know ,  i have returned this sport bra . 
i ordered directly through bissel to make sure it fits . 
a bluetooth headset seemed like the way to go . 
the item was returned due to size being inadequate . 
i ve tried sticking handles with rags ,  dusters ,  etc . 
the blade sharpens easily and holds an edge fairly well . 
will not keep num_num gallon one goldfish tank clean . 
and the concealer does not lay flat on the floor . 
first off ,  i had high hopes with this foundation . 
consider another kit ,  your employees will thank you . 
so ,  to be honest take care of this radio . 
it s okay ,  but it goes on very pink . 
my daughter and i both are allergic to most soaps and lotions . 
each one is a total burnt up mess after use . 
found a much better case called the ibolt . 
all the different heads all attached with a small bolt and cotter pin . 
i don t really trust the band to hold up . 
a pack of instant swiss miss is way better than this . 
all it did was left pink on my face . 
it rose within num_num minutes and baked up fluffy and beautiful . 
i kept using it hoping it d phase out and get better . 
the lock should be hard for a thief to open . 
with alpha hydroxy and sunscreen in my moisturizer . 
on the up side it may make a good game for children . 
the music in the disco is ok as was the boss music . 
made the wife happy but upset at the same time . 
i bought an actual new battery and it lasts all day . 
i bought this product based on its excellent reviews . 
they don t play at all like what i was expecting . 
after debating ,  i must say to others to pass on this unit . 
thank you fisher price !  !  !  my faith is restored . 
do yourself a favor and do not buy any num_extend products . 
a good pair of wool inner gloves work as well as this product . 
this product cleared my acne ,  that is for sure . 
my guess is that these are the standard size . 
everything included is what you need except for the heat gun . 
i do not care for the fragrance either . 
that s why the military uses clp and not just oil . 
the blace does a much better job and much faster . 
unfortunalty for me it didn t work well at all . 
i could not get the card to work on windows xp . 
as one reviewer said ,  everything snaps into place or fits snugly . 
there has got to be something better for the money . 
the rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden . 
amazon us doesn t list the pc version of this game . 
keyboard controls are great . so much potential ,  so much wasted . 
first off ,  when opening the bag i didn t smell vanilla . 
the radio shark has been a huge disappointment . 
they told me to search the net and find the old adaptor . 
the connectors are identical on my old cable and this new cable . 
the  inside  elements toast darker than the  outside  elements . 
maybe it s just my body type ,  but these don t work . 
i really love the idea of these hoses . 
sometimes ,  they would spawn near or in front of you . 
have no idea whom to call to get some support . 
to start ,  it s ridiculously hard to inflate fully . 
all of frams oil filters are nothing but cardboard inside . 
i am very disappointed setting the day is a bitch . 
stopped working after i used i it once . 
the little wrist pad that comes with it broke right away . 
on the latest a linksys g router with all the latest code updates . 
or ,  maybe ,  having played future perfect first ruined it for me . 
he doesn t move like he does in the movie . 
tried to reach company but they re giving me the run around . 
you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . 
very disappointing as i expected better quality from honeywell . 
it looks like peanut butter until you put a spoon in it . 
just don t expect it to be much else . 
num_num has got to be the worst year for games . 
it is only num_num cal per serving vs . 
memo to sony :  quit rushing games out the door . 
i will get a free bottle of lotion that these people can use num_extend
i ll use it ,  but will not purchase again . 
its not made from sugar and no it doesnt taste like sugar . 
i was very excited to see this offered ,  so i ordered immediately . 
coming from a puzzle maker ,  i was appalled . 
i am shocked ,  i have never had this happen with quinoa before . 
the batteries do not hold a charge at all . 
the sound is fine ,  if not a little buggy . the gameplay . 
i used this game to play with adults not children . 
took me some time to get the facts  ,  . 
this can opener lives up to all the hype . 
the balm doesn t asorbed in the paw pads . 
there was no need for a rival scenario in the game . 
constantly messing with the piece to keep it touching your jaw . 
num_extend the tent came looking a little dirty . 
the design allows easy cleaning under furniture and in corners . 
the only place where graphics are good are the movie sequences . 
it s hard to find smaller size metal bakeware . 
however ,  now the headset just died .  .  . after num_num months . 
this one feels a little weird and honestly i don t suggest it . 
after getting beyond the look ,  the flavor left a bitter after taste . 
the shoulder straps had thin ,  poorly padded straps . 
this smells just like aramis mens cologne !  nasty ,  awful . 
the bottle design is already awkward to hold without it being wet . 
the poopy dog game was better designed than this . 
i had yet to find a product that could manage both . 
it comes without a lid ,  which is a little annoying . 
these are not like the typical keen sandals . 
though all in all i like that all the components were included . 
but they are tight fitting around the foot . 
so i immediately switched all of them to another source and brand . 
i tried repositioning ,  adjusting and readjusting num_num times or more . 
i was in denial when the pictures weren t coming out sharp . 
wish i had listened to the bad reviews of this product . 
this item does not work with timex indiglo watches . 
i sent the game back to them with a letter of my own . 
listen ,  i like a deal like everyone else . 
personally i don t care about the story anyway . 
i ll stick with the delicious chocolate flavor  :   . 
i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife . 
we knew we were paying for these flaws . 
but i would have preferred that to what i got . 
however ,  this case is almost as slick as the phone itself . 
it was terribly dry and powdery to a point . 
there is a narrow thin bar on each side . 
she only used it while sitting still to look at books . 
that said ,  china imports large quantities of u . 
if you have dry skin ,  this is not for you . 
i donated the remainder of the case to the local animal shelter . 
definitely do not recommend this product or any from this company . 
look somewhere else for your armrest covers ,  good luck . 
it left some hair and some feces but it walked away . 
it doesn t take me num_num seconds to finally just take them off . 
the cones are a hard ,  brittle plastic ,  not a soft one . 
but the thing is constantly putting itself way out of calibration . 
unfortunately ,  i learned upon arrival that only the chess pieces have magnets . 
make it useless when it just flops around . 
it has the exact same issues ,  so it s a design flaw . 
thank heaven there was no shipping charges for this . 
more of a pain in the fanny to use then it is worth . 
a cheaply made shirt at a cheap price . 
i was quite enthused to try this tea ,  based on reviews . 
i do not recommend to anyone especially if you have a picky eater . 
with the apex it takes forever even for num_num disc only . 
i find that sprinkling out of the bottle does a more direct job . 
typically i put on socks and they fit . 
ordered an emerson num_extend never buy another cheap knife again !  . 
it works wonderfully ,  and the aroma is divine !  . 
if you are thin ,  stick with the levi s . 
thankfully the price and shipping was low or i would return . 
the future i believe will be awesome though for the psp . 
and friends reported similar disappointments with other generations . 
chromium is hard to get due to the depletion of the nutrients in num_extend
it was not rubber but plastic and would crack easy . 
num_num characters huh ?  looks like num_num to me !  i  felt disconcerted  . 
you get awfully sick of hearing  snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake !   every num_num seconds . 
i also tried almond oil  massage oil  and found it works the same . 
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use . 
therefore i ended up with two outbreaks back to back . 
try activating bluetooth or any other phone related function during a phone call . 
only thirty !  !  and that problem with the stupid thing overheating . 
while they were replaced by kodak ,  the replacements had the same problem . 
i recommend buffalo and dont skimp out cause of price . 
anyways ,  this time i returned them for a refund . 
this is really just a trick to make more money . 
all i can do is set the clock . 
i concur with the others that commented on num_extend street wireless . 
it was so thin i believe it would break easily . 
if i could rate this thing at num_num stars ,  i would . 
as a cheapskate ,  i guess this paddle nailed me harshly . 
trying to let it air out for a bit . 
you just have to be incredibly careful with it !  . 
not exactly functional if you follow the recommended weight limits . 
bought this based on a recommendation of a friend of a friend . 
due to vision problems i work mostly large piece ravensburger puzzles . 
i tested this lens with my num_extend and num_extend with the same results . 
the positive reviewers indicated that it was sweet and flavorful . 
you don t dig a trench ,  let alone build a num_extend
would i recommend this to newcomeres of dead or alive ?  no . 
i thought i d work ,  but it just never did . 
si todavia no tienes un num_extend esta es tu oportunidad de conseguirlo . 
my daughter received this toy as a gift . 
the game falls short in almost every category except music . 
and please ladies ,  do not use too much . 
i would have paid a little more for a better quality beanie . 
i weight num_num and the med would not even fit over my calfs . 
i have been using this product for only one month . 
no or very low volume in one ear . 
i ended up giving these to my girlfriend because they were freakin  small . 
i was so disappointed bc this seems to get great reviews . 
my scale arrived with part of the plastic base broken off . 
 diamonds  looked more like tiny pieces of gray gravel . 
the problem here is that it is not fun . 
they stop me up when i wanted them to help me stay regular . 
i tried the number keys and the keypad . 
i found these cashews too salty and peppery for my taste . 
people were coming from far and wide to sample my goods . 
these speakers sound about as good as my num_num year old laptop speakers . 
and oh yeah ,  always buy extended warrantines on any num_extend player  :   . 
these players aparently suffer from a hardware flaw involving the progressive scan . 
there is no way to avoid reaching in to the box completely . 
have had this machine for light printing and convenience of fax and scan . 
we were expecting better quality material to last a bit longer . 
the second order i placed i ordered num_num lbs . 
your better off using some higher grade vitamin e oil . 
that is where my phone began to work . 
one drops network connections  on the wired switch portion even . 
i ll stick with the us from now on . 
bioware is the company that made the first knights of the republic . 
it only slightly hindered encapsulation but greatly annoyed me . 
overall just disappointed that parts didn t fit well together . 
i based my decision to buy these on the reviews . 
tried this also in my sons hair and same thing happened . 
i played this spyro game first and found it flat and tedious . 
the directions are very vague and the products cheap . 
honesly ,  this whole kit is not worth it . 
i ve lost one of these already due to its cheap construction . 
however ,  on the box it states only num_num pounds for a speaker . 
i received the new num_extend a couple of days ago . 
pro : i thought this was a clever idea so ordered one . 
i was hoping it would but no such luck . 
something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation . 
even at $ i returned it as is was not worth that price . 
an icy cold glass of tuscan milk makes it perfect . 
get the kong brand toy that looks similar to this one . 
actually when i first received the case ,  it was great and beautiful . 
i bought this on the internet sight unseen . 
they were fresh and squishy ,  and well packaged . 
i m writing this to warn everyone to be careful . 
not yakisoba . it is not that bad but kind of greasy . 
pay the money and get the entire water testing kit . 
this device was just a waste of time . 
it may just be for power and not data . 
get a cheap folder with pocket clip and save yourself the aggravation . 
the one we purchased was constructed of thicker plastic . 
for whatever reason these books don t appeal to her . 
but ,  he also destroys the bees in a nano second . 
it is way too small for my dog . 
i enjoyed playing nox more than diablo ii . 
i was never a fan of the playstation num_num controller . 
unfortunately the combination of the flavors is just okay . 
it can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power . 
i was looking for a natural ,  darker than nude color . 
these have num_num calories and num_num from fat . 
this is what i bought this blender to do . 
i couldn t move forward because of one battle after another . 
the hose comes straight out of the box with kinks in it . 
i am switching to iced tea in glass bottles now . 
this is a great idea that is poorly executed . 
i have many scars from moles being removed . 
they walked around like they were drunk and kept falling over . 
levis must have changed the fit without customers knowledge . 
pull the headset off and move it closer and it is fine . 
if you have a less reactive soap ,  i suggest you purchase some . 
i don t know what i m going to do . 
like this product at all i will not order this again . 
trying to fit num_num bikes on it is an act of hilarity . 
i have no means to judge it against comparable fare . 
these are not kung fu ,  wushu or tai chi pants . 
i would consider this a drug store quality product . 
this stuff does not do a very good job in holding everything down . 
i have a daughter with spina bifida that has a lot of pain . 
dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at num_extend
even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end . 
it seems like it would since the wheels do . 
btw ,  i paid $ at big lots for this . 
don t use on strawberries which will be canned . 
it s expensive and i never saw a difference in my hair . 
please note that a lot of these reviews are from num_extend
don t worry about any more orders ,  there will not be any . 
the music is not the best and it gets annoying after a while . 
if i darken the room then most of the light is blocked out . 
the num_extend subwoofer enclosure weighs a full num_num lbs . 
the fact that it is passive really kills it . 
it was like the device wasn t attached to my computer . 
as for this chair do not waste your money . 
the coffee flavor was not very strong considering how dark it was . 
mine never rusted in those six months ,  though . 
maybe if it was made in america we would not have this problem . 
the color is much darker than pictured ,  and it is a mess . 
i usually love kong toys ,  but i was disappointed in this one . 
i do not recommend buying this piece of crap . 
but for some reason they did not like these much . 
hint :  stick with the sur la table crumber for $
i ve had greater success with crystal light flavorings . 
as a whole ,  it is very expensive for its poor result . 
this charger is always lower than the white oem one . 
the thing slides everywhere on the counter top . 
i bought this knife on a whim ,  and should have waited . 
i don t think i m missing anything in regards to the use . 
there is a large gap on both sides of the zipper . 
the high price is not commensurate with its ability . 
the many faces of the protagonist niko leave him completely unrelatable . 
maybe other people can get used to it ,  but not me . 
nothing !  everything was predictable and easy to beat . 
we thought the paint will light in the darkness ,  it is not . 
a few powers destroy everything else making it zero fun . 
the toe of the shoe was damaged and i returned the item . 
this product is impossible to put on properly the first time . 
there is also foam that looks like skimmate in the mixing container . 
how the user is supposed to utilize it is a mystery so far . 
it is supposed to have a beeper for various functions . 
except it won t close with the ear hook on . 
two other brands made at the plant have been recalled for salmonella . 
this item has very poor fit and poor quality . 
should have listened to the other bad reviews . 
one just fell apart while as a christmas party . 
i d rather have one of those than a candy bar . 
i think they missed the mark on this one . 
the focus wheel has lots of slack and feels junky . 
and maybe a new stove in the fall . 
my wife tells me the marks aren t washing out . 
skating around the same people all the time is pretty boring . 
thin and do not soak up very well . 
i even sent them pictures and still no response . 
i never noticed any difference in my skin when i did use it . 
when i awoke it was still at % battery . 
my dog loved the small versions that are crunchy . 
perhaps i ll be wrong and you ll love it . 
the castle and the accompanying pieces are so flimsy . 
i will stick to store bought lipstick from now on . 
normally oxo products are excellent but not this one . 
it smells nice and did make my skin feel very clean and smooth . 
but it does not work like i remember it . 
i believe they are too small to sink due to water surface tension  . 
we called our vet who wanted to see him immediately . 
after a few minutes ,  you have a nicely pureed chicken soup . 
blistering over % of each foot when only applied to one toe . 
i am so sorry i got involved with braun shaving products . 
pass this game ,  you ll be glad you did . 
the automated voice will tell you check the problems in their website . 
just a very thin layer of this cream has almost smothered my face . 
i bought it to complement the num_extend exercise program . 
our utensils are rarely clean ,  and are always spotted . 
i thought this was gong to work great for my dry cuticles . 
came close to getting melted plastic on me . 
there is no codebreaker here to challenge its dominance . 
i never had a problem with those buttttttttt . 
i have liked most ,  loved some and hated none until now . 
i might rent it but i seriously doubt it . 
so who knows ?  the first two leapsters broke for mysterious reasons also . 
ugh !  i could not get over how soft these were . 
recieved game num_extend num_num days ago and ran great out of the box . 
it s not worth the cost of shipping to send it back . 
each character has their own story line and specific powers . 
just don t use this ,  it s not worth the risk . 
in any case ,  this collar did not work for me at all . 
i will be switching to behind the neck headphones . 
i never dared to carry it in a pocket . 
i wish i would have spent more for a better one . 
an overbearingly strong sour and sugary taste is the reason why . 
not the best quality but worked for awhile . 
he pushed this thing around like no tomorrow . 
meat waste can have very bad things in it . 
but i did not pick up one consistent channel . 
this allowed cardboard dust to get all over it . 
we use it every day and care for it per cuisinart s instructions . 
this is an absolutely beautiful and feminine styling of cane . 
this product is very overpriced and undersized ,  just like all proactiv products . 
will go back to what i purchased before . 
dont know why ,  followed instructions and tried multiple configurations . 
i purchased this refurbished unit a couple of weeks ago . 
however ,  these only last me about num_num to num_num hours of heat . 
anyhow ,  these hats are just tiny and do run really really small . 
its sort of like trying to fight in a box . 
big mistake . seems like a num_num star product to me . 
all the bluetooths lately seem to die within a year . 
the lavendar witch hazel is so much better . 
a good amp makes some difference ,  but not by much . 
but he picks this one up every now and then . 
i seriously can t think of a worse one . 
that is why amazon is the number on on line market place . 
there is nothing  crisp  or light about it . 
it is ,  however ,  mindless and generally easy to play . 
the bottle itself isn t level when sitting on a flat surface . 
you can only play as mario and luigi . 
one packet is supposed to make about num_num good goo gallons . 
in a game that did not have crafters that would make sense . 
i bought this to convert family vhs tapes to dvd format . 
i m using the pelican brand case until otterbox works the kinks out . 
i ll stick to regular cutting boards and chopping blocks . 
verizon has international data plans for travelling as well . 
it is like a spray powder that turned my hair white . 
i will toss this out and buy a more natural product . 
it would not spin or respond in any way . 
just plain ordinary shampoo with no mint scent at all . 
it doesn t really taste like watermelon or strawberry . 
the ds lite s big selling point are its brighter screens . 
i think the product design was better than the product . 
left tampa airport to houston to change plane . 
but then again ,  so little of the xbox games do ,  anyway . 
this pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it . 
i will be returning later today and searching for a different option . 
wear tights or orthopedic stockings sometimes for relief . 
unfortunately as i used this case my callers could not hear me . 
i have olive toned skin and it looked really powdery and pasty . 
i bought this for my new num_extend but it did nothing . 
i got a cheap imitation that is about num_extend shorter in length . 
i specifically purchased two of these to play smash bros . 
this conditioner just doesn t moisturize as well as other deep conditioners . 
good idea  ,  but does not work well . 
it stopped working the same morning that they opened . 
i have found these issues across reef s entire line . 
the seller ,  on the go solutions ,  was responsive . 
if you have a slender wrist i do not recommend it . 
very poor design and a poor quality material for the clasp . 
i mixed in stir fry and ended up throwing the whole thing out . 
there is extra thread and it smells awful . 
i just bought a $ analog sw radio which is vastly more sensitive . 
maybe this product does not work well with kitchenaid . 
in the end we decided on the water soluble astroglide . 
furthermore ,  there are quality control issues in production . 
i have had good luck here with kong toys . 
but in less than an hour he destroyed it . 
the problem with repeaters is that there currently are no universal repeaters . 
i do not recommend this item at all !  !  save your money . 
therefore i am giving bioshock a one star rating . 
got the plantronics num_extend bluetooth headset for an iphone num_extend
my breath will clean my glasses better than this ultrasonic cleaner will . 
it works better if you are closer to it . 
however ,  i was greatly disappointed in this product . 
i bought this system as part of a dell xps num_num gaming system . 
i definitely would not recommend this to anyone . 
i found it to be very cheaply made and not worth it . 
one of those products taht you buy online and you wish you hadnt . 
this one however has much smaller treat holes . 
an extremely slow game that took me hours to make any headway . 
this spray does not help us at all . 
click a button and you hit for num_num more damage . 
this is how to give a dog allergies . 
i can t believe i dont appreciate the game . 
the strips are larger ,  easier to handle and click into place . 
the honey flavor comes through ,  but the texture is off . 
having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought . 
other than it being really thick plastic the cover fits perfect . 
i would rate this num_num stars if the constructionwasn t so shoddy . 
no way to repair them without tearing the thing apart . 
this thing is covered in cheese ,  and not in a good way . 
it also stuck in some places worse than the world s best . 
it required large chunks of time to really get into it . 
i certainly did not abuse the case whatsoever . 
it does not live up to its advertised claims . 
i used it this morning and it turned into a total mess . 
and they chew on everything ,   they are ages num_extend to ten months  . 
these are very like the hotdogs  which i like very much  . 
cord snapped only after the second time using it . 
it felt well put together like the real ones though . 
this did not fix the problem and ultimately the device failed completely . 
a can at walmart is about $ or less . 
the food started sticking within num_num months of purchase . 
i bought this router and a netgear wireless pcmcia card . 
it should be above the ankle ,  these are not . 
the choices are all ,  well ,  exactly the same . 
i found a huge stuffing mess all over my living room rug . 
i got it for about $ here with free shipping . 
this created a minor hassle when putting a gun in the case . 
not sure if these were spoiled or what . 
the honest truth is that the thing never worked right . 
the configuration software installed by autoran from the cd . 
they look more like dress pants than cargo pants . 
its glued together and seems like it will fall apart . 
don t get me started on the cost of these either . 
this lotion has a very ,  very strong scent to it . 
we didn t receive red ,  yellow or blue as described . 
therefore ,  everything here sound very good so far . 
i would rather buy an expensive one than waste money on this . 
was looking for something a little more protective . 
i am smiling as i write this review . 
i had to cut it half and half with milk to drink it . 
based on the reviews ,  i thought this might be a good fit . 
i would not recommend this product based on the quality alone . 
second its diameter is too small for the depth . 
i was given the chance to try out this product for a review . 
he has not played with it since ,  only that one time . 
so when i saw silent hill num_num for $ i was suspicious . 
in my experience it  pir  just does not seem to perform consistently . 
i son received this for his birthday from a grandparent . 
they really screwed this game up in every way possible . 
i guess i was expecting too much after reading all the great reviews . 
i cannot get it to tighten right or even start the install properly . 
the description states that this dual pack is num_num ml . 
yes ,  the same nonstick coating they put on pans . 
this product doesn t work as wonderfully as in the video . 
they all lasted about a year and a half . 
this product looks like a hit or miss depending on your injury . 
five bars per box ,  and in no way worth the money . 
num_num plastic sends out a confusing message to thoughtful cooks and chefs . 
it came in a clear bottle not the white one . 
just need to mention the seller gives you quick service . 
got this in an attempt to contain the granules . 
this is a cheap imitation and not fun at all . 
i have tried every which way to get the cards recognized . 
it does work  disabled by default  but not all symbian programs support it . 
and surely i will never be a netgear s customer !  . 
as far as i am concerned cuisinart can eat its line of pots . 
and was open at the bottom allowing for docking with the case on . 
the hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it . 
this product made my very coarse ,  thick hair so incredibly soft . 
i was expecting a softer ,  more pliable ball . 
did not come with cap as indicated in picture . 
back to nature chocolate delight granola is an okay granola cereal . 
they are flimsy in nature ,  and they peel . 
i thought it would be a good unit . 
i could see pixelation of the image on the case . 
for the same calories and nutrition ,  you can do a lot better . 
then ,  eat something or chew gum to get rid of the aftertaste . 
this was a very expensive purchase that went straight into the trash !  . 
everything about this game is infuriating to play . 
i have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it . 
when it did work ,  it worked as advertised . 
one other reviewer mentioned crushing them and mixing them with hamburger meat . 
also ,  in white ,  it gets filthy on the outside as well . 
it is inexpensive and compact enough to fit in narrow spaces . 
it touches the tiniest bits of hair at a time . 
so you do not seem to know which you will get . 
i don t know why this got good reviews . 
some of nordic ware s other stuff is ok . 
a lot of elbow grease will be needed ,  here . 
case makes it difficult to use the control stick . 
with the edge angle established ,  final sharpening was easy . 
this is the last linksys component in my lan . 
it felt like it was on fire for num_num days literally . 
they rode up ,  rubbed my chota raw with all the motions . 
my advice :  get your baking dishes through ebay  !  !  !  . 
thats why i liked gold and sliver but this is stupid . 
i don t think this toy was designed well . 
these are realistic qualities that appeal to a dog . 
and the google nexus num_num is a phenomenal phone in every way . 
i had to add lemon zest to give it a flavour . 
diappointing when it is clearly made for nano tanks . 
photos are compressed as jpegs inside the camera . 
i used it about num_num times a month for the last num_num years . 
to me ,  it is just as intense as stetson . 
i ll place this copy on sale and get the pc version instead . 
the jam option ,  the cake and meatloaf options are lame . 
this product claimed it was a charger for iphone num_extend
i m afraid i will not order any more . 
i have a full size sedan and this windshield cover was too small . 
i have never been able to download the supposedly free game . 
however ,  they were rubbery ,  not firm and crunchy . 
the handle is a lot smaller in diameter and shorter by num_num inch . 
you play an entirely different character from the first game . 
no attention to detail ,  basically it falls flat on it s face . 
this stuff has that extra something in it . 
not the best choice for a dog treat . 
changed them back to the original ones real quick . 
fully charged ,  it does not even last eight hours . 
cheap plastic lenses that popped out waaaay too easily . 
my hair color remained the same all the way through the dyeing process . 
even the mister setting was a little too vigorous . 
leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth . 
the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game . 
it isn t silky ,  it is too big and it feels cheap . 
of course ,  then i started reading other reviews saying the same thing . 
its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptops . 
the first time i took it ,  i took it for num_num days . 
i sent them back to amazon and got a replacement pair . 
the original manhunt is in my top num_num game for num_extend ever made . 
but ,  don t waste your money on this load of  fluff  . 
tried to get support but no one available to help from plantronics !  . 
its a great idea but just doesn t work . 
i threw them out after i got some hanes . 
the next one had the arm fall off . 
set it on top of a num_extend fence facing directly into my yard . 
itunes is a good program although i never used the music store . 
i will never buy an htc product again . 
company great !  !  !  i give the co a a+ . 
it feels a lot smoother then num_extend and ttt . 
the sense of speed and framerate are superb . 
i left them in the outlet for at least num_num min . 
i love this drink but your price is too high . 
bought one when i was in the middle of a move . 
i wear a num_extend and never had a problem with a bra . 
no undue pressure was placed on the loop . 
it acted like it might help at first but then it just stopped . 
poorly made hard mesh case didnt fit much to loose . 
hence ,  this cost us $ for a route canal !  !  !  . 
but in fairness to the product ,  i do have small dogs . 
i got a sample of this flavor yesterday as well . 
you can get more information at the leapfrog website . 
no one could explain to me what happened . 
too small when ordering my stepmothers usual size . 
not close to color shown even with num_num coats . 
all i have is junk to show for it . 
amazon contacted them and they told amazon that they would refund my money . 
i bought this item to use in our office as a room thermometer . 
there s more cords to contend with ,  but the box works well . 
sometimes they even pop off after the door is closed . 
i won t be ordering from this company again any time soon . 
saw it in a local store so i picked it up . 
i received small bumps on the side of my face . 
i had a playstation num_num then bought a gamecube . 
i am num_extend and wear a size num_extend
i m not entirely sure who motorola is targeting with the num_extend
plus ,  my skin feels drier but less drier than dove soap . 
don t even bother to look at the cover ,  stay far away . 
in guild wars ,  you see people in town or in battle . 
this is not good game and the graphics are dated . 
but all this is not without its price . 
this is a horrible score to recieve from them . 
num_extend the fruit flavors are indistinguishable from each other . 
however ,  it has no holes for num_extend colt . 
there are a couple reasons i would not buy this again . 
cracker much too hard for me to chew . 
it became a lot of fun for me . 
kikkoman soy sauce has num_extend of sodium per serving . 
put your money towards a real food processor . 
the game gets really repeditive after the second level . 
these are soft cups and the description should have made that clear . 
originally ,  i ordered a size num_extend but it was way too small . 
at times ,  removing it immediately works ,  but not always . 
when they leak the leak ,  and it is very messy . 
it is steaming along with an oily layer from the steam . 
i tried fon and didn t see that it made any difference . 
this thing is not even useful as a toy for your children . 
it doesn t have enough pigment to cover blemishes well . 
num_extend easier to clean but you have to clean more often . 
but they were nice about it and gave mea refund . 
the left stick drifts down all the time . 
it is not worth to send it back . 
unfortunately ,  it ranked the lowest of all of the entrees . 
this is a num_num star product that gets one star for irresponsible marketing . 
this product was not usable or even helpful . 
if you want cancer this is probably for you . 
everything just has a rushed and unbalanced feel to it . 
i had this done with my girls and a few days . 
at the lowest possible setting ,  got painfully strong jolts . 
also this buzz does not glow in the dark . 
he loves it ,  but he cannot play with it anymore . 
maybe it will save another parent from buying this awful stuff . 
it s sitting in my closet ,  will probably donate it . 
the biggest challenge is the ability to properly clean this machine . 
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first . 
i dont see this router reliable at all . 
i expected a hand hammered ,  rounded wok as shown and described . 
there should be a rating of zero stars . 
the blue ant sent was not in its retail package . 
do not buy for num_extend power button cannot be accessed . 
the price is much higher than in the super market . 
amazon was wonderful and gave me a refund . 
i don t know who designed this pan but they should be fired . 
i was worried ,  so i had to rinse it off . 
i even had one lid split because it would not stretch . 
 i ve had both systems ,  more on that later  . 
it never once fried my hair like this did . 
why do you think they need to include three !  . 
even with the new patch the logic of the scoring system remains a num_extend
you have to push the keys ,  not just touch them . 
too expensive for what you get and too hard to do yourself . 
it lets you know when you have made a successful connection . 
don t pay more than ten bucks for this game though . 
i bought them to wear while i watch and exercise video . 
it s okay for sweaters ,  but not strong enough for shoes . 
forget about doing well ,  that was too much work . 
it s by far the best game out so far . 
num_num hour from now it will be uninstalled . 
so ,  it just depends on your own biology . 
here ,  you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles . 
the right buckle does not open properly and is a num_extend
the handle snapped in half without much pressure . 
good navy and concept but not for narrow feet . 
i really must stress how bad the graphics are . 
especially because i bought it when it first came out . 
after about two weeks of use ,  the rake stopped moving backwards . 
sure wish they would bring back the older ,  sturdier ones . 
i m not overweight at all i just have cellulite on my legs . 
once they arrived we put them on the charger . 
the product didn t do what we hoped it would . 
i would check every few days and they just decomposed . 
i think that s the way it really sounds . 
i am surprised i bothered finishing this one . 
my first thought was that it was  shelf worn  like clothing gets . 
i couldn t help but realize that thq forgot to finish this game . 
urban reign is a beatem up fighting game for the num_extend
you don t have enough time to regain health . 
i have used deva products on and off for years . 
they tend to flair at the bottom which is not attractive . 
i noticed that the  beef  did not come from usa per the package . 
the brush will brush out my hair ,  but so would any other . 
the montly cost of wireless  and you need the $
it doesn t taste like sriracha or potato chips . 
all in all ,  this card is a complete waste of money . 
the case is too small for the street pilot num_extend
i had smaller tanks with a small bioload . 
this thing fits like hammer pants for my torso . 
the plastic handle is the biggest reason i did not buy it . 
the unit comes with a num_num year warranty . 
as the game progresses the controls get more and more important . 
i will never buy a valve product ever again . 
ea had plenty of time ,  right ?  i guess not enough time . 
i m returning to my old brand  clinique  or will try something else . 
it seems just silly to do that and obvious not to . 
from deduction ,  it must be a colonge for smokers only . 
you enter a room ,  collect some things ,  and solve a puzzle . 
and then after that year you may find yourself with a dead receiver . 
i got better results when i used bedhead wax or design essentials . 
also ,  the flat pan barely fit in the oven . 
i bought chai tea before that was not decaff and i loved it . 
the developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this . 
i don t want to use the aluminum rods anymore . 
used with an amp the volume gets real num_extend
and the world war ii locations and weapons remain accurate . 
leather on inside was nicer than another pair i tried . 
this compensates for the wrong angle on the top front of the unit . 
well ,  i read the information on this item and . 
tried this and the chicken ,  neither left a pleasant taste at all . 
this would be a much better item if it actually stayed up . 
it has a big flaw ,  one in common with other olympus products . 
it hasn t been very successful for us so far . 
it will collect dust until i find a screw that needs some oil . 
the graphics r pretty good for the ds but not the best . 
not a very good rent definitely not a good buy . 
these earrings are so tiny it filts a child of five years . 
the graphics are stunning ,  but that s it for me . 
i think there are better walkers out there . 
so i waited until my friend got it . 
its rubbery ,  fits too loosely around the phone . 
i have only had this a few months and the numbers are fading . 
but it doesn t work with the garmin nuvi num_num lmt . 
i was very disappointed when i received them . 
i ordered these disk carriers having used up my supply of similar cases . 
this game however is even too hard for me . 
not very vanilla to me and does not last very long at all . 
these definitely work to keep my cat away from the area . 
i have read the book over and over . 
this particular one is much bigger than the one i already have . 
the only thing i liked about these razors was the wide rubbery handle . 
savanne slacks have always been well tailored and represent the latest fashion statement . 
i think reception quality trumps surround dound in the end . 
then i noticed the throw rug was saturated . 
so even if you get leaner it may report more body fat . 
i bought the num_num pack and followed the direction . 
i bought this because of all the great reviews . 
i ordered several projects from the motions hair line . 
they were thrilled with the cooling capabilities in the morning . 
he likes to hold them upside down and spin their bellies . 
i d be willing to replace the pump but can t find one . 
after realizing that all this info is omitted from the listing . 
there are several of these page magnifiers available here on amazon . 
other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are num_extend num_extend num_extend
but even after years ,  i find it frustrating to use . 
even with the loud noise it still cleans the tank well . 
however ,  she is num_num years old and picky . 
so ,  i can only guess how good this game is . 
i like alcohol filled candy of any kind . 
it broke the first week i had it . 
but i didn t notice any effect at all . 
i was very impressed with the quality of the paints . 
and i think that s the right word for it . 
partly my fault because i didn t realize it was already ground . 
the canteen moves around in the cup ,  also has sharper corners . 
do you recall bioshock s constant bsod ,  stalker does it too . 
wish i would have just saved my money . 
these had a strong smell and stained their paws . 
the unit does what it was meant to do . 
i was so excited thinking it would actually taste like cookies and cream . 
the headphones are great ,  however a few issues that i had . 
i love starbucks via but was really hoping for an organic alternative . 
you can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with bots . 
although from the picture i can tell that it looks exactly the same . 
if you buy this game you are wasting precious dollars on pure garbage . 
the characters in the game move exactly like they do in sof . 
so it loses the fixed ip address you just assigned . 
anyone who says they don t has to be full of it . 
the nylon collar is terrible to try and keep on the dog . 
they refunded the order with no hiccups !  thank you amazon . 
this thing did absolutely nothing on my standard poodle and his pulling issues . 
then i looked at the tag on the bra itself . 
without those ,  i just don t feel like playing . 
i am sure it will only get worse over time . 
that is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo . 
there are better toys to spend your money on . 
i used it for num_num weeks faithfully along with the powder . 
don t waste your money ,  use a tuna can instead . 
my kids peeled them and stuck them on everything very quickly . 
although it is dermatologist recommended ,  i was totally disappointed . 
today while handwashing a piece just seemed to detach itself . 
she recommended roc retinol correxion eye cream or neutrogena s . 
but after using lubegard i have found a stark difference  better  with lubegard . 
i was completely put off by switch kiwi berry . 
two weeks later i find her bed ridden . 
my issues is actually with that fabulous bungee leash . 
there are better systems out there than this one . 
or why the pinkerton detective agency is called the  pinterten  detective agency . 
it s not entirely nasty ,  but it s not very appealing either . 
this is so big ,  i didnt realize just how huge it was . 
those are its only functions and it fails miserably . 
it cuts clean even if the score is skewed away from parallel . 
the package says  managing your weight never tasted so good  . 
i got chips after only a few hours . 
i purchased this for my num_num year old grandson . 
i wouldn t waste my money on it again . 
you may care even less if you hated final fantasy num_extend like myself . 
therefore ,  the psp is about as unbreakable as a painting . 
this thing is practically impossible to clean thoroughly . 
these ones dry crooked and don t allow for thin striping lines . 
i bought this to try and cut costs from my normal vitamin . 
more important ,  most of my pictures are coming out great . 
for most people that doesn t matter ,  i guess . 
after i warmed it up it still had a slight unappealing smell . 
dont have the time or energy to return a $ iteam . 
it was really thin and watery and wore off after about num_num seconds . 
the graphics in  far cry  are stunning ,  especially for being produced in num_extend
i bought it to control a dishnetwork receiver in another room . 
i wish i could have those num_num min . 
the picture has no structure most of the peaces are a multicolored mess . 
i borrowed it from my uncle and i was really excited . 
we line them up when the kids all come home with their families . 
not at all like what i was expecting . 
needed  note past tense  it for an awards banquet on num_num january . 
this is probably the case for this product that did nothing for me . 
i haven t used it and it s still in its packaging . 
my hair continued to be wavy and frizzy after use . 
i wouldn t recommend getting this ,  waste of your money . 
i ordered a size bigger since they look like a juniors cut . 
the fat is reduced ,  that much is true . 
the num_extend is much larger than this cover . 
bought this charger to leave in my truck . 
one charge ,  one test and back it went . 
the ends will not stay hooked onto the glasses and keep falling off . 
i bought these because i joined a masters team . 
i suppose it also depends on your dog . 
i paid about num_extend here at the time . 
they ve been telling lies to us consumers for some time . 
had to use amazon mediation to get my money back . 
used almost the whole jar !  still no flavor . 
i bought a num_num and they were very much too small . 
but what would you expect at this price point . 
i like that they re good for all ages . 
after reading the reviews i ordered this thinking it was a good moisturizer . 
i needed slippers because i have fibromyalgia and spend most days indoors . 
otherwise ,  i would have given this item num_num stars . 
also the elastic waistband does not stay up so constantly pulling at them . 
again ,  applied the product as instructed; without success . 
filled only half full ,  as advised ,  but it leaks constantly . 
i bought this at a local merchant but returned it . 
if you want a game like this ,  play painkiller or condemned . 
i first heard about goji berries on dr . 
i liked the thermal carafe and i liked the appearance of this unit . 
and it hurt like before ,  but still wasn t localized . 
don t bother wasting your money on these riverstone goods toe socks . 
left on counter for hours ,  thinking room temp would help . 
at no point are you afforded the opportunity to fool around and experiment . 
this stuff was watery and the color was not concentrated at all . 
i like that it look just like a mirror . 
i tryied to use them on a shooting range . 
the healing items and magic is woefully inadequate most of the time . 
if that is your plan ,  you should buy another product . 
chance the description and say doesn t fit num_num jeeps . 
since then ,  i have not heard hide nor hair from this company . 
the cereals are glazed ,  moderately sweet but hard to bite . 
the cheese sauce comes in a packet that you squeeze on the noodles . 
the leather underneath the film is completely unfinished . 
received num_extend replacement today and it is the same as the num_extend replacement . 
it jumps ,  skips and locks up playing num_extend video files . 
waffles didn t stick this time ,  but it does overheat . 
now less then a year old the right side stopped working . 
this is not the retionl cream i was expecting . 
there is no lingering scent of rosemary or mint to speak of . 
this product is probably best for women with straight hair . 
my lab chews through every single toy except kongs . 
two hours of the same level is not worth my time . 
just tried this for the first time with my num_extend old . 
the price sounded good ,  but not for the quality and aggrevation . 
this thing broke before we could get it out of the packaging . 
ended up throwing the best part of the jar away . 
it was a waste of money and i had to throw it out . 
it leaked out in drops thrown all around the processor on the counter . 
this gives me a clear view of traffic behind and to my right . 
i like norpo ,  but eggs will stick to this thing like glue . 
the one disc alone does not add anything to the game for me . 
the thing that makes this unusable is a very short working distance . 
i had to throw away half of a bottle . 
i am disabled and at first i was pleased with this machine . 
it feels good and solid and has worked for a few months now . 
num_extend games like god of war had much better graphics . 
the only use i have found is an oversized toothpick . 
this toy was good for about num_num minutes . 
all the other comments are right ,  it s bigger than you think . 
it wouldn t even respond to a hard reset . beware this product . 
after that the fans wouldnt start up unless i manually spun them first . 
she simply refused to take the nutrical ,  however . 
everything was quality made ,  not at all flimsy . 
this is the second otterbox defender series case i have purchased . 
i search the internet for a replacement and could not find one . 
i got home all excited and read the ingredients . 
after num_num months of use ,  the mount was in tatters . 
the target practice is basically num_num targets going directly upward . 
the packaging is great and amount of product is okay . 
 though ,  obviously ,  it wouldn t fit folding stocks either .   . 
the mango ,  honey ,  and apple flavors dominate this sauce . 
you need to press hard to really see the color on your lips . 
the retaining clip is very weak and broke on first use . 
my son also tried it and didn t care for it . 
it does not go up very high either . 
they should have looked at some other dog houses first . 
then the excess line wraps around the hub . 
it felt like a much more precision piece of equipment . 
but i think i picked the wrong color for my skin tone . 
i just put a towel under it when we cranked it . 
my dogs are num_num and num_num years old . 
my dog got very excited when i gave him this toy . 
that one is far superior in every way . 
had it for a year and had to throw out . 
these protectors do not adhere to the surface very well at all . 
bought this one but it was doa  dead on arrival  . 
it was also very strong and the flavors were off . 
amazon s customer service has always been well above average for me . 
only buy if you have very narrow foot . 
they didn t even bother to call me back . 
it gives no support and the material is very uncomfortable . 
i bought two of these for my kids and they are awful . 
the litter does not clump very well and breaks . 
this tonic makes it more like a boozy soda . 
this is because calcium supplements usually make people constipated . 
the smell is very strong and makes me feel nauseated . 
i suppose i got what i paid for but it is disappointing . 
not at all what i expected from an aveeno product . 
so now i have a num_num dollar paper weight . 
it is a decent pair of boots for the money . 
one from amazon for $ and the other for $ on ebay . 
i got it at a academy like the other poster on here did . 
i ckecked to see what size i should order . 
beans looked plump  ,  however not so sure about the product . 
this will not give you even fake num_extend like that . 
it truly frightened me so i looked at the ingredients . 
i was very disappointed in this and will never purchase it again . 
i think they are a great idea but she wouldn t use them . 
its just small ,  looks like a toy ,  not kids piano . 
i plugged it in right by her pillow . 
the target platform is tinny and will not hold up for very long . 
i just don t get the rave reviews this is getting . 
the best handheld gaming system is the gba : sp hands down . 
it s hard to use ,  hard to reach points on your body . 
i picked up this lens today from the post office . 
i don t get all the hype about this particular product . 
i did everything right ,  but still didn t work . 
i bought a new oral b pro brush that came with this head . 
i sold it two days later ,  at a loss of $
if you move the slightest bit they fall out . 
i haven t heard how she did with them . 
broke the buckle the first time i tried to put them on . 
the memory foam it advertises is a joke . 
the kids ate more apples and other fruits . 
the end result was a baked product that tasted foul . 
i was very excited to try a gluten free cereal . 
no bits of hanging plastic or bulges in the rubber covering . 
i will not buy anything from this mfr . 
but after using ours ,  it s almost cruel to give her this . 
doesn t get hot enough to do any real cooking . 
it was just regular run of the mill moisturizer . 
a different bottle too ,  just as the others had mentioned . 
nokia has a micro sd card in the box with this phone . 
most of them tout how they have been using eheim classics for years . 
it may work better in a different car . 
i had been using bob s red mill bran and really liked it . 
i see no other benefit ,  but i do see a high pricetag . 
very poor quality cable ties ,  not gb brand as advertised . 
halo is up there with ipod s in my humble opinion . 
however ,  this gave me the worst case of gas ever . 
i really wanted this camera to work for me . 
i honestly can t recommend this pump for presta valves in any scenario . 
i guess they re only concerned with motorola devices . 
the pins are the worst and not do stay in place . 
the good news is that my brother s rottweiler loves it . 
but other sets arrive quite securely packed and are in perfect condition . 
i had a refund even before they got the scope back . 
i previously gave this product five stars when i first bought it . 
after a week i removed it and tossed it . 
it contains num_num seeded peat pots and a dozen different vegetables and herbs . 
they can only be charged from one of the ports . 
but it is meant to just sit on a shelf . 
i can t imagine why any one would want a serrated vegetable peeler . 
the edges of the plastic are sharp as well . 
for a toy you toss to your dog ,  it was fine . 
everything in it feels like a chore rather than a challenge . 
the storyline is so stupid that i skiped the in game movies . 
check out pacific natural foods organic almond milk . 
about % of the photos are great ,  without changing scene or settings . 
whomever made this product ,  didn t care for repeat business . 
i was very disappointed in this case when i received it . 
if you want a good mmorpg i suggest anarchy online or everquest . 
took him off nupro and his ears cleared up . 
so ,  we asked grandpa for a christmas gift . 
finally a little while ago ,  i forced myself through it . 
i was also unable to tighten the replacement bulb sufficiently . 
another watch bought out here that didn t work upon arrival . 
while graphically ok ,  the gameplay just isn t there . 
if someone wants to buy from this store think about it first . 
when he realized the show is over ,  he crawls off unamused . 
the performance was ok but i would constantly see the wireless signal fluctuating . 
the mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it . 
i actually bought it twice and it broke on me both times . 
they were just not okay on my num_extend num_extend frame . 
do yourself a favor and purchase from known retailers only . 
the checkers are small ,  very flimsy ,  and not magnetic . 
i love nb shoes but these hurt my feet terribly . 
 although the new black one has lasted almost num_num years now . 
would have been num_num stars if hadn t been melted . 
scam !  these silly product will just make your neck tired . 
the smell is very appealing and was bummed at the end results . 
some people say pill splitters are all pretty much the same . 
i contacted panasonic for a  no hassle  replacement since it was under warranty . 
usually kong products last longer than other brands . 
it isn t advertised as spicy hot ,  but it is . 
but alas put it back in the box . 
expected to help with exterior noises in hotel rooms etc . 
i expected more cocoa but its rather like more a spice tea . 
we used to feed our dogs this until we read the ingredients . 
this has to be the worst cookie press ever . 
now the whole top is starting to sink down . 
fell apart before i could really even use it . 
wrapping on handle peeled off after short time of use . 
i received the daisy num_num targetpro from amazon today . 
you are basically paying $ for a not too bad popcorn popper . 
have used it for num_num days now ,  two tablets a day . 
it teaches a bad latch ,  in my opinion . 
everyone is different though and reacts differently to a product . 
this is cheap as in price and in quality . 
why ?  it breaks the contract between the player and the game . 
as a comparison ,  my braun travel shaver cuts closer and quicker . 
i should have listened to the other reviews . 
i have always bought size large snowsuits and they have fit well . 
they should pay people to forget this thing was ever manufactured . 
ants will have a field day with it i think . 
this cologne i reccomend for like age num_num and above . 
it doesnt work !  !  this is a rip off . 
the tools are cheaply made and fall apart very easily . 
this bone does not belong in the extreme line . 
seems like a nice watch ,  but with poor quality control . 
now the whole thing s in the trash where it belongs . 
the red white and blue thing is sure to fray and break . 
some people think they re wonderful ,  but i can t eat them . 
just push forward on the pad and fight . 
it s num_num pieces glued together ,  not one solid piece . 
the wind could easily tip it over cause it is so off balance . 
i contacted the seller but got no response now a month later . 
i also bought aaa and i need num_num for my device . 
he is only a bit over a year old .   . 
i wouldn t recommend paying that high of a price for it though . 
i usually wrap the containers in plastic for longer storage . 
wouldn t recommend them unless for a gag gift . 
i will not order from this company again . 
people who like fruit cake might like it . 
i am not knocking this juicer in particular ,  but juicers in general . 
who knows what other site it cannot access . 
i still have the walk n ride but its sitting in the backyard . 
this is a disappointment for the djv and djffny . 
the millet instead was also very dry and flakey . 
i ll just buy a better one  different brand  next time . 
the breakaway part seems very good as well . 
i m used to food that tastes like food . 
i was not at all happy with this item . 
the case cracked as soon as i fit it onto my phone . 
batteries that come with it are good except for the charging issue . 
i felt very big and bulky when i had this belt on . 
also ,  there is a bad cinnamic aldehyde flavor to this . 
the magazines on the other hand fit and work perfectly . 
the packaging was in superb condition when my otterbox commuter arrived . 
now just a nice usb cord ,  but not a wall charger anymore . 
in this respect ,  its like an mxr num_num band . 
dr oz is the one that suggested this . 
it s become more of a hassle that its worth . 
this poor guy just did not like keeping his air . 
i read all the user said before order one . 
this is the worst stuff you could put on your face ladies . 
bad quality product from what i can see . 
that s num_num installations over the entire life of the game . 
the product itself is worth all of $
unfortunately ,  the engineering and design of this unit suffered . 
sadly to say that it doesn t have any taste . 
i will probably replace it when my new screen protector arrives . 
i like the character creation ,  and the gameplay itself is alright . 
i bought a pair fory mom and me and they both went back . 
i didn , t realize you made the coffee in the pot . 
i had to super glue part of the lid back together . 
will not buy again ,  should have got something else instead . 
my skin feels tight ,  like there is a mask on it . 
it took me five hours of gametime to get the num_extend
i had mastermind as a child and loved it . 
one adorable little squirrel per dog ,  plus a log home . 
buyer beware of all health products with sensational claims . 
i ended up just using the bottom of it . 
my son got this for me as a gift . 
this just felt like i was putting water on my face . 
not worth the hassle of getting it repaired . 
after one use this turtle has a leak that i cannot find . 
for the same $ buy an antenna that will not disappoint . 
however ,  the soccer ball did not stand up against my bull terrier . 
haven t found a good allen company product yet . 
they weight half as much and are barely half as good . 
way too stiff with a very hard insole . 
it meets airline specifications which is the reason i bought it . 
i had days when i couldn t go for num_num days straight . 
the harsh artificial peppermint flavor tastes exactly like mouthwash . 
all told ,  only the blade seems fine .  .  . so far . 
there no other word to describe this camera . 
it has been called nature s calcium channel blocker . 
also the boot must be moved to disengage the noodle . 
i m looking to replace this piece of garbage . 
i sprayed it on this morning and headed to work . 
and you can t see very far in front of you . 
not to mention ,  the straw is more like a tube . 
i m very disappointed in case logic for this terrible product . 
the bar was too wet and soft for me . 
tunes like the $ radio that it is . build quality gets a num_extend
dont even think of removing and replacing it at all . 
very expensive but worth every penny if it would help . 
i ve heard parts of songs that i d never heard before . 
the game started out ok but then started to drop in intrest . 
had to cut open the side that goes to the antenna plug . 
i bought this for my daughter only because it was on sale for $
anyway i wanted a replacement and ordered this item . 
i bought these a few years ago and terrible treble . 
i had to throw them out as they were useless now . 
they nickle and dime you to death for life . 
the package for this drive is virtually impossible to open . 
these are indeed extremely lightweight but that s not a good thing . 
i cannot imagine using this tool in thick grass or hard dirt . 
i was a bit disappointed in how cheap these sunglasses ended up being . 
remember this before you make the num_extend the screen display is terrible . 
after playing through that game ,  it sets the standard . 
i guess i have a new pair of period pants . 
this unit never worked correctly from day one . 
the speaker is tiny on back hard to hear and makes cracking noises . 
if you see this game ,  just ignore it and walk away . 
this netting is really only good for something like an outside window frame . 
there is no sofware update to fix this problem either . 
so no way to judge how product works . 
the edges are not smooth but instead rough . 
honestly ,  it s more aggravating than the money you waste on it . 
i only have the disc that came with it but its quite boring . 
i m downgrading this review from five stars to two stars . 
if it were not for this it s a keeper !  . 
good thing it was cheap .  .  . and now i know why . 
i am disabled and cannot drive far enough to find it . 
perhaps the best coffee is in the us if this is any example . 
the battery appears to be what i would consider a counterfeit . 
it dropped audio connections while dialing ,  or after num_num minutes of conversation . 
the d is truly the leviathan of the collection . 
however ,  the animals do not always go down the track . 
you just sort of save the city over and over and over again . 
i ve bought one way better that looks exactly like this . 
these are nice panties ,  well made and of a substantial fabric . 
would be difficult to use for our family . 
i ve had these spice jars for about num_num years . 
i haven t seen any better graphics in pc computer games lately . 
seems like i m going to have to search for another product again . 
 :  i bought a can at a nearby natural foods market yesterday . 
it looked cool at first ,  but i was quickly disappointed . 
i got an rma from them and i am sending it back . 
if still no good ,  i ll try a different manufacturer . 
i did not feel any pulsing or throbbing of my face or neck . 
it looks like streaks of rainbows down the screen . 
i love mango but something was not jelling for me with the taste . 
i thought it would be a nice extra to his birthday gifts . 
that s why its getting num_num stars instead of num_extend
if you buy this be prepared to spend hours installling it . 
i purchased this pillow due to having neck pain . 
item arrived at my post office postage due . 
it seems more irritating than the older modles . 
the sound is just too hard to our liking . 
sorta cute design ,  needed for party last minute . 
its ok for the people like basic cell phone . 
i m not seeing it !  no more moroccan anything for me !  . 
if amazon has already sprouted ones ,  someone please let me know !  . 
the case fits well and would provide adequate protection under normal daily use . 
i finally decided to try this one because it looked better . 
i brought this breadmachine based on so many good reviews . 
they still make a great ankle cuff sock with a thick cushioned sole . 
i still need to keep my aaa membership . 
i will not be buying these bars again . 
i have been using sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years . 
i ran out recently and ordered a new bottle from amazon . 
i reached a bit further only to have both saved games get corrupted . 
got this to add a couple of outlets in the bedroom . 
i still have my songs and less of a headache . 
like other reviewers ,  water comes out luke warm . 
i was excited about this little gadget but the excitement quickly went away . 
not to mention ,  they re very rough and uncomfortable . 
i thought it could be removed but it can t . 
since i had lost my receipt ,  i was stuck . 
i have a celestron firstscope and a canon rebel slr . 
i just used it for the first time yesterday . 
these just don t work for my equipment at all . 
this game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking . 
and ,  what s bad for kids is rarely good for parents . 
otherwise ,  great idea if they improved the durability . 
a few bucks more from a vet insures safety . 
at least this one stopped working within the warranty period . 
the graphics are pretty good ,  but not much else . 
oxyelite burned fat really fast but it also makes you anxious and jittery . 
all three of the caps arrived with numerous holes in them . 
you would need to be desperate  like i was  to use this thing . 
i bought this for my kitty who plays with just about everything . 
all my num_num front side screen protector are went bad . 
republic wireless solved this problem over two years ago . 
i gave it to my sister who is very fair skinned . 
it moisturizes and it certainly adheres to the skin . 
not the best animation ,  but i like the ap concept . 
it has absolutely no effect on me ,  good or bad . 
i don t have the patience to figure it out . 
this was only the third time we had used the blender . 
the cars are exactly like the real thing . 
i have always like calphalon ,  but this is not a good piece . 
so we ended up with tons of clear slime all over our backyard . 
in my experience it barely grinds celtic sea salt . 
right now it holds a charge for two epilating sessions . 
these don t even come close to covering my burners . 
so ,  i can t really recommend spending the money . 
then i tried a box cake mix and the same thing happened . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
for some reason the skin on my body is more accepting of it . 
there should be an option for  no stars  for a product like this . 
even if you think you got it on there right . 
to me that is a whole chunk of rpg that is gone . 
why not use a zip top resealer like others do . 
well it steams as advertised but the dirt does not move . 
all the various wrench shapes were cut with rounded precision . 
they leave the edge of the spinning disk inside your storage tray . 
this shirt is so much bigger than the other one . 
the battery has samsung branding and says it is nfc . 
i took it off imediately and won t be giving it another chance . 
been really disappointed in most games out the past num_num months or so . 
the product was working well and did what it said . 
however ,  the frustrating control makes this game boring after num_num missions . 
it flakes off and causes me eye irritation . 
the texture is ok ,  but the aftertaste is overwhelming . 
i ended up only using a few times . 
after using the product i would get a headache . 
i bought one of these for each of my four controllers . 
you can buy this one at the goodwill store next week . 
i can t expect perfection without even seeing the makeup . 
i had had it so long it was like an old friend . 
it is not a ruger product ,  and the actual imprint is ncstar . 
while waiting to receive them i was advised they were out of stock . 
after seeing all the hype i was so excited to try wen . 
i would buy again though ,  because i like liquid eyeliners . 
the screw top cap with floating ball stoppers isn t worth the drawbacks . 
this particular case ,  however ,  took forever to get to me . 
the weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed . 
the second test was to chop chicken for chicken salad . 
the rest of the story falls apart from there . 
i recently purchased isotoner therapeutic gloves for my arthritic hands . 
you could also use this with just vegetables ,  if you are vegetarian . 
well i got the game because i thought it would have cute animals . 
i am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream . 
i do think they would work for someone who does not have allergies . 
going by a semi resulted in a static jumbled ,  speaker blowing mess . 
it is still bleeding black on a tissue . 
i am revising this to ,   causes more deer damage  . 
not at all sharp enough for a decent hair cut for my boys . 
the bicycle seat is comfortable however it does not wear well . 
you should spend a few dollars more and get a better ball . 
not sure what all th hip is about . 
i m not an audiophile and have no complaints about the audio quality . 
concept is wonderful but could be made much better . 
i took the coffee pot out and examined it . 
they should of had that option straight from the beginning  . 
i recommend buying a blue rigger num_extend usb cable . 
it has the exact same problems as the one i returned . 
he s a num_extend maine coon and he tracks litter everywhere . 
even my husband could not use this device easily . 
i tried to reason with them ,  to no avail . 
it seemed like fine salt that was colored . 
and the only spice to taste is a little bit of pepper . 
i ordered a  one size fits all  and i got a large instead . 
i returned these for small chews that are specifically made for small dogs . 
you have to dump the grounds and clean this thoroughly after each use . 
well ,  this happened twice with two different controllers . 
plus ,  the audio is on the tinny side . 
it s too bad because otherwise it s a great looking screen . 
i did not like the product at all . 
i wish the white board  or chalkboard  was magnetic . 
the grahpics are awful ,  it looks like xbox ,  not num_extend
the sole of your tennis shoes works better as well . 
excellent highs ,  plenty of bass ,  and tons of volume . 
rip off and it broke the first day we purchased it !  . 
having said that ,  i like everything else about this product . 
i have three boys so i m immune to the noise . 
they are less sweet than the honey only ones . 
just be sure that you want a trackball mouse . 
as it only cost $ i guess you get what you pay for . 
the wrong end of this dog smells better than her breath . 
this was by no means a smooth playing experience .

my spouse liked the appearance but was disappointed that it did not work . 
none of the rc helis are put together with care .

i ordered num_num of these for my daughter s bicycles . 
casio parts sells the battery for about $
my dog had a terrible skin reaction to this product . 
the new one did the same thing within a few days . 
just up and down ,  not side to side . 
so for us ,  this toy is not great . 
it does the job !  it is slim and inconspicuous . 
does not deserve the rating in velo magazine . 
i even bought a china glaze color to go with it . 
when you blow in some areas ,  no sound comes out . 
easy for my dog to literally sink his teeth into . 
i really don t know how i d wear this . 
i m definitely disappointed and wouldn t recommend this to anyone . 
spend a few more dollars and get a decent one . 
i got this for christmas num_num yrs ago . 
you ll be wasting your money and time in my opinion . 
unfortunately this cable wasn t treated well in manufacturing . 
usually i like the electronic parts in games because they make it simpler . 
love the fact that i could program the buttons for what i needed . 
the price for this bra is too high . 
i bought this machine to make liposomal vitamin c . 
i ve been a fan of final fantasy since the beginning . 
instead ,  this game is just a looonngg mission . 
at least brush num_num to num_num times a week . 
i ended up throwing out all six bottles . 
better to just go with the cherokee women s flexibles maternity wrap scrub . 
spend a little more and get a good phone with more features . 
its a good toy but he never used it . 
this has got to be the smallest head ever . 
it s a good concept ,  but it is definitely not downwardly compatible . 
i used it twice but found it to be uncomfortable . 
i immediately put them back in the box and returned . 
although my son prefers the taste after being cooked on this tray vs . 
what else can i say ?  it is doa . 
the children ask about it but i tell them it is broken . 
did not fit the phone i bought it for . 
the flavor was affected by it and had adry dusty aftertaste .

i don t see the cons of a tarantula keyboard enough in print . 
amazon also carries racconto brand which i haven t tried . 
i did not like this product at all . 
the clincher is that they just don t work . 
baggy all around size num_num at num_extend num_extend
a num_num inch blade is huge and is prone to chatter and streaks . 
with this product your heels are pushed up about a quarter inch . 
the dress is not a shiny material as it shows in the picture . 
this however was not the case for me . 
much smaller than most toy guitars that you see in the stores . 
santa brought this to my num_num yr old . 
i ve been using this primer for about a week now . 
bought this on amazon and got it shipped right away . 
there are too many grahams to be individually wrapped . 
my quest to find the perfect green tea led me to  bigelow  . 
i have num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend ram and geforce fx . 
i purchased this bluetooth and it would not charge . 
they ate the pill pockets and left the pills . 
but the real problem is the way the grinder is designed . 
even the ingredients listed in the product page do not list fragrance . 
came in a three pack and one did not work . 
this product smells bad make you sick to your stomach and dizzy . 
unfortunate since when previously ordered most bars intact and fresh . 
i will probably try a lexar or simpletech . 
i spent so much time looking for my baby`s first sleigh . 
these went back as soon as i saw the quality . 
even if you grease the cups ,  the eggs stick . 
i guess i can use it around the house . 
the red and black mixed together ,  which i hated . 
i ll pay more ,  but i ll like what i m getting . 
but it shouldnt be by ripping us off . 
so ,  skin tight thighs and seat ,  but oversized waist . 
i can t believe it gets such good reviews . 
i was hoping for some kind of scent . 
someone said this was great for an older person . 
thought this product would be good until it gave me massive nose bleeds . 
i waited for almost num_num weeks and the charger never showed up . 
i wouldn t recommend it unless you carry a lot of bills . 
it started to chip off after two days at work . 
i have had them before with spicy flavorings and there were fine . 
i recently bought  barney butter almond butter num_num calorie snack  and loved it . 
it looks like the glazing is cracked and not necessarily the crock itself . 
the water fill is very limited and the pressure isn t enough . 
construction seems decent ,  just good for small girthed thighs . 
it s light and stays out of the way . 
overall i was very disappointed in this product . 
decent quality with a good price ,  but not functional . 
it shaved off large chunks which went all over the place . 
i bought this conditioner just wanting to try something different . 
i had to rewash everything without the socks to remove the shedding . 
just cook some chicken and cut it up in small pieces . 
did not realize how small the containers are . 
i would not have purchased this if i had known this . 
the butter could soak into the exposed clay . 
having used the older model before i was looking forward to that familiarity . 
unfortunately ,  the mini no longer has a real nut inside . 
but good things are rarely cheap and cheap things are rarely good . 
tastes good but after many months ,  i m still not pregnant . 
this was an inexpensive product and it lived up to its name . 
trees and plans are just num_extend card board cut out . 
forgive the short review but the subject pretty much sums it up . 
not so crazy about the toilet paper or paper towels either . 
also ,  the extracts are more pure and concentrated . 
since this is amazon ,  there was no problem doing so . 
the sun is so big you could fit more than num_extend earths inside num_extend
not as fun as i originally thought it would be . 
i contacted customer service and so far i haven t gotten a response . 
just make sure your kitchen aid model fits this bowl . 
well ,  you can use this powder to make your own chocolate . 
so was reduced to sticking my finger with a pin . 
works good ,  battery lasts much longer than expected . 
my granddaughter num_extend years old and they fit her . 
i have resorted to duct taping it shut . 
quality is not up to standard for the price num_extend

crosman used to be an american company with american quality . 
the quality on these was a little disappointing as well . 
i bought these for airplane use and found them to be ok . 
not in brightness ,  but in richness in color . 
not a lot of options to explore here . 
w don t know how he has any teeth left . 
this bluetooth headset has great sound for both calls and music . 
i would have given this more stars if it had lasted longer . 
this was destroyed in less then two days . 
a dog that tosses their toy in the air to catch it . 
i put it on and wore it for one day . 
i must say that i m very dissapointed with the num_extend
but once the mall is built it gets boring . 
this now lives in my first aid kit for cutting athletic tape . 
hammer  i like peanut butter  also works well but are more expensive . 
the problem is most likely the bt driver software from widcomm they include . 
i found the instructions and the mandoline itself difficult to use . 
i personally don t have enough hair to curl . 
i m unsure the need for such a device . 
these are so small and so low as to be useless . 
i got this outfit for halloween last year . 
no comparison to my evo s built in stand . 
still works for as a place to store a rope without getting tangled . 
voice changer has a delay and sounds like garbage . 
kind of flemsy ,  but the price is right . 
there are much better and cheaper ways to clean your face . 
i really ,  really liked it the way it was . 
might work for other uses ,  just not mine . 
they also say idebenol which is also another fraud . 
also the rag doll physics are realy lame and unrealistic . 
and finally a real pan to roast in . 
and as soon as i went to use the kickstand it came off . 
i went with a griffin survivor after that and never looked back . 
this product tastes great !  but not without a price . 
whereas ,  this bag has two very thin pockets that bulge very easily . 
i just have to proclaim how great this is . 
it was one of those last minute  checkout  decisions . 
you can try it if you want to ,  but be warned !  . 
i could hear her tummy growling  :   will not buy again . 
but this toy hasn t been very interesting to my daughter at all . 
io gear is clueless and offers me no help . 
lucky are those who can bear the over powering smell . 
this headset wouldn t stay on during my run . 
extremely hard to program both clock and timer . 
let me know of anything anyone uses that does work please . 
i found the odor to be unbelievably strong and bad . 
with its shell ,  i think the crustacean escaped the bouillon pot . 
the smell is delicious !  the conditioner is really awful ,  though . 
he used his spell power in the first fight . 
moving my head would cause the earbuds to dislodge . 
most of the products were bland at best if not gross . 
it seriously left a very strong plant after taste . 
wants to be groomed via hand and this isn t really cutting it . 
doesn t auto connect to devices when powered on . 
when i tried to assemble it i realized that it s defective . 
it allows you immediately know how much charge you have left . 
however ,  it doesn t seem to push enough juice . 
i was expecting ,  essentially ,  ivory bar soap in a liquid . 
i expected something for the price to be thicker made . 
it will not retract and just dangles ,  tangling him all up . 
if bent by accident it will never be straight again . 
pros :  very little goes a long way ,  so apply sparingly . 
this microfiber cleaning mitt is ok but hard to keep on your hand . 
it is too little to attract anything except the smallest of birds . 
i ordered this item twice  both times showed in stock  . 
also the easy to use software was an advantage . 
the link worked great ,  but only one port worked . 
had to take off the skirt because it was very scrachy . 
had to through it away cause its messy . 
i thought maybe they changed the ingrediants but not sure . 
ok ,  it is daytime dim in here ,  and certainly not dark . 
both my cats just stared at them and walked right by them . 
the sides and back are cheaply thrown together . 
applied as directed this definitely got rid of unwanted foam in our spa . 
item needs a much better description as i would not recommend this item . 
well ,  i did ,  and it has worked flawlessly . 
going to buy one in store so it doesn t happen again . 
i have had this camera for about a year and a half . 
our cat does not like it at all . 
how boring ,  num_num car ,  that gets stuck on the second floor . 
if you want this shirt buy one that is two sizes too big . 
you can get it cheaper at your local video game store or ebay . 
there is a reason why this is so inexpensive . 
i just could not see myself paying the high price for this product . 
fine ,  by now i m expecting them to be tough . 
my son likes it better when it is off of the tracks . 
i think there is a big difference between red and pink . 
i find the bass strong but a bit muddy on these headphones . 
spend your money on something that won t be a disappointment . 
and it feels stiff and bulky and flat . 
these will make you think there is something wrong with your equipment . 
yes ,  i can say it will make it worst . 
i just saw this trackman in passing and just had to warn others . 
it comes with a treatment tip programmed to deliver num_num treatments . 
temperature can be read reliable at the transmitter but not on the reciever . 
i got this hoping it would help my thin hair . 
i m not sure why as the spout is a good size . 
$ for this bag is wayyyy too much for the quality delivered . 
i wanted to like it ,  but just didn t . 
but that s not the only reason i gave it just num_num stars . 
if your kid drops it once it is likely to break . 
my dog chewed off the yellow felt material in less than num_num minutes . 
never had that problem until i started using this mascara . 
if the scale is accurate that is all you are getting . 
it doesn t appear like it will last long with daily use . 
i guess their products are just hit and miss . 
it s like i threw money out the window go find another product . 
i was really looking forward to putting this on my truck . 
the pill case itself isn t the one pictured either . 
she is not one to play hard either . 
the end of the wiper arm is now encased in lovely plastic . 
it makes no sense and is so boring ,  he hates it . 
i am just not impressed with this toy .

i equate this game to building a sandcastle on the beach . 
i had more and darker freckles and my forehead was slightly burnt . 
i bought the pink asic gels for my younger daughter . 
first what is pictured is not what i was sent . 
it s completely empty and cleaned out but still doesn t work . 
anyone else do this ?  there are no scratches . 
it opens great and is worth the hassle if you get it under $
once i get it out in the sun it takes forever to charge . 
i got this because i was deceived that it was stainless steel . 
this is true; the crotch is no good in them . 
the lense was scratched and there was glue on the lense and housing . 
it is difficult to line up the top and bottom . 
i mean ,  this did not hold up at all . 
for many years ,  i ve worn this type of shoe . 
i had an elago case before and i liked it . 
i need to remember a few passwords anyway to keep my mind sharp . 
beware ,  you will not get the item that is pictured . 
the banana ,  muffin and milk carton are fun to play with . 
i edited my review to correct some spelling errors only . 
on the upside ,  they are very soft and comfortable . 
 amazon instructions allow returns only for unopened products . 
forty years ago every percolater you could buy was a good one . 
first num_num uses they would slide right and it worked as advertised . 
the graphics however are pretty bland ,  as is the sound . 
the pictures under the letters are not the best choices for a toddler . 
you re better off getting optimum nutrition flavorless creatine . 
the pillows were fine ,  i did not have a problem with them . 
this is bad one can not use at al . 
this is a beautiful robe but it is useless to me . 
the headphones fall out while you are standing perfectly still . 
buying stevia for the benefits is not what this product does . 
it is more salty than regular soy sauce . 
i didn t see any real results after using this entire product . 
i my mind it does not live up to the cuisinart name . 
opened the box and was impressed with the appearance . 
it s all just processed kibble to which color has been added . 
it s now sitting in my pantry awaiting a garage sale . 
i also got my credit in a timely fashion . 
my bumps got worse after using this kit for a few days only . 
the strap came off the first day of wearing . 
i researched online for weeks before buying an indoor grill . 
the bottle was small for the money and is just about gone . 
most are hollow inside with a hard layer at the bottom . 
it went right out the garage door in a flash . 
two stars only for color match . diana faillace von behren reneofc  . 
i was addicted to contra as a kid . 
the appeal of this specific product is suposed to be the packaging . 
what character progression i saw was relatively fast and satisfying . 
for daily use i d recommend looking at other bodum presses . 
i highly discourage anyone considering buying this product . 
the game is overall very generous with the rupees as well . 
this game is horrible first of all the play is slow . 
this set could easily be reduced to num_num num_extend
as an engineer i always look for good designs . 
i tried this over and over and over without success . 
too short to be put into drywall even with anchors . 
i purchased these based upon the positive reviews . 
it does such a wonderful job and gets every last drop . 
doesn t respond easily to the ball coming in its mouth . 
this leads to exposure of all the internals to be easily broken . 
anyway it s lost somewhere and we definitly don t miss it . 
and ,  i m not just writing for fans of first person shooters . 
it s no way i could get a leg into these . 
this is very cheaply made and does not work for me . 
i was quite excited about operation flashpoint after playing the demo . 
i will definitely read all vendor return policies before making any further purchases . 
the macro s are nice ,  but can be lived without . 
they fog up way too easily and the lenses scratch . 
very little in the way of manual settings . 
even a regular sized dinner plate can hardly fit . 
make no mistake ,  this is a great pad . 
good idea in theory ,  but product development needs work . 
hours on hold ,  sent to level two support . 
chi s can get your hair reasonably smooth if you work at it . 
it would we nice if these came in different calf widths . 
it broke the second time she wore it . 
i purchased this but not sure how to use it on my hair . 
and that is about what it is worth . 
this almost led to a very costly issue . 
it just doesn t talk to the computer via firewire ,  noway . 
i gave me black pair to someone who has smaller feet than me . 
so i have decided not to buy any sandisk products ever again . 
it is nice and tingly ,  but it is a pretty useless product . 
i had to take the battery out and put it back in again . 
the product i wanted had a ball point end . 
in game hero system ?  warlords battlecry num_num does it better . 
the dee rings appear to be solid ,  so will not likely break . 
it functioned for about num_num days ,  then constantly went into  alarm  .

we ended up purchasing oak scrap and remaking the piece . 
this is the second travel charger of its type that i purchased . 
i give it a num_num star because of that . 
i bought this bell thinking it was for adult bicycles . 
something interesting i found in halo num_num was bigger environments to explore . 
the character sprites and animations are also a beauty to behold . 
tried it several different times then i just ended up throwing it out . 
however ,  it is a mess to clean ,  and is fragile . 
i tested mine at num_num on the rockwell scale . 
unfortunately there are fewer and fewer real trackballs available . 
died some cheap material and not well made . 
i would not advise buying this product ,  even if it was cheap . 
my dog didn t seem to be scared from them . 
very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features . 
eco styler is dead to me . edit :  march num_extend
also rather thin so not optimal for coverage . 
the formaldehyde odor is so strong it made my family sick . 
either pay more for a better model or go elsewhere . 
the powder dissolves a lot better than it used to . 
i have a small portable pair of num_num x num_num binoculars . 
i didn t have good results with this product . 
i recently bought a panasonic lumix num_extend after a long camera search . 
i can t say this about most of my electronic gear . 
there is no fun in this game at all . 
no ,  it does not remove staining that was already there . 
the box itself is so cute ,  with its little bird . 
tried purchasing two different styles of num_extend gen accessory . 
it ll do the exact same thing as this but probably better . 
clean clear ,  easy to install phone well protected . 
in the photo image here ,  the container looks like glass . 
i would prefer soda water with lemon or lime over this drink . 
i bought this card to use with my pda . 
i think i will stick with panasonic rice cookers . 
the ottorbox did not fit my iphone num_extend properly . 
i could not hear them right up against my ears . 
up until now ,  they have not let me down . 
she ,  a dancer and teacher ,  swears by it . 
the winner is the one who has the most tokens in the end . 
again ,  not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs down . 
maybe i ll sprinkle what i have left in the kitty litter box . 
i won t buy this again ! thanks for nothing vibrant health !  . 
i have since tried several other usb ports . 
it seemed like such a great idea at the time . 
it was only effect with super fine scratches . 
compression foot sleeves ,  msm and ibuprofen were much more useful for me . 
for muay tai and free rolling ,  i still wear the classic jock . 
it s hard to stay awake playing this game . 
ended up taking these off and using a fresh round of duct tape . 
there is no metal band inside the plastic . 
they say they ll replace it and pay for shipping . 
exact order so i m surprised that these are so much longer . 
even then it can be hit or miss . 
also the finish was a bit sticky . very disappointing . 
i used to have a microwave rice cooker that worked great . 
to me ,  num_num is the last great final fantasy i ve played . 
so the search continues for that perfect shampoo . 
until then ,  however ,  the cd will have to collect dust . 
i am going to give it to my friend who has a dog . 
do not cook dessert with sugar on it . 
but being new doesn t equal good . and now to the clincher . 
i had chosen big train because of the wonderful reviews . 
i would not recommend this product unless this is an isolated case . 
it was truly like a malt shop milk shake . 
when flying it outdoors ,  wind and bright light will affect it . 
spawn armageddon is hack and slash game played in the third person perspective . 
i own num_num of them and they are constantly being recharged . 
this brand is no longer a  sure thing  ,  as it once was . 
i know this game came out a long time ago . 
i ve been using devices like this for a few years . 
too old for all that silly stuff of survival . 
i am afraid it will bust open any time now . 
it had more drops than jermichael finley does for the packers . 
the default headphones that came with ipod sound better . 
it s cheap but at least should work just once time . 
invest a little more money in a better set . 
the same applies if you want to get into safe mode num_extend
the only drawback is the shoe ,  colors are made for runners . 
these boots are now made in china ,  quality dropped . 
on the plus side ,  these monitors look and feel amazing . 
it tasted a lot more like cloves to me . 
we tried changing batteries ,  tinkering with it but nothing . 
yes ,  this is rather firm for being silken . 
i would say its not even worth renting . 
i love the squeaking factor of the ball . 
we tried resetting it several times but it still wouldn t work . 
i purchased this because a physical therapist recommended it to my friend . 
i m ready to chuck this puzzle in the trash . 
i was so hoping i could have a cover in every color . 
i returned it ,  but ,  it took a month to do it . 
i had such high hopes for this case . 
the sweet toxic smell is similar to some other products made from china . 
for what the size was it was much too small . 
i bought this largely on the strength of the brand name . 
unfortunately ,   schizm  has lots of contrived puzzles that don t make sense . 
i bought this so i could drink cold ice tea at work . 
it does darken lashes a bit and separate and define decently . 
you can get better deal on great bag for less $
made a terrible mess when i just tipped the bottle and  poured  . 
in the end ,  i only kept it for the spf . 
before ,  the num_extend were a zipper fly version of the num_extend

i would not recommend purchasing this hummingbird feeder as it spills very easily . 
this is a good ,  very useful type of cutting board . 
i want to love it ,  but i just can t . 
better decanter design gave me the stainless steel upgrade . 
i can t say the same for this light weight item . 
i wouldn t recommend it if want a replacement that lasts . 
i had to scrap it and get another one . 
meyer s stuff the scent name and actual scent don t match . 
first two or three doses seemed to work as well . 
i feel much safer using natural products likeburt s bees natural remedy kit . 
if you want cheap plastic then go with this . 
go outside and find an ant hill to watch instead !  . 
once that happens ,  they cannot be put back on the bag . 
if it weren t for verizon ,  the phone would be fine . 
 i m guessing they were expired or close to it .   . 
the strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it . 
reviews on this one are a little misleading . 
i am going to trade this one in toward timesplitters num_extend
i ll give another ,  more thorough review in a week or so . 
i have to fill water four times to cover the whole num_extend
i found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands . 
better off just throwing your utencils in the empty drawer . 
one set of batteries overheated in the charger and was destroyed . 
of the first num_num disks i burned ,  num_num were unreadable . 
avoid this product  for xp  until belkin releases a better xp driver . 
they leave a terrible taste in your mouth . 
but be prepared to find those balls all over the num_extend
the pump itself also wastes a lot of product . 
but for some reason it didn t fit my att version iphone num_extend

on the other hand if you dont have r . a . 
i m not fond of the scent of this in my hair . 
just go buy packets and do it yourself . 
chicken is so easy and fast in the cooker . 
we would have done much better getting legos instead of this . 
i bought a different design and have had no trouble on several rides . 
i like the security of the screw downs though . 
as such ,  i consider them to be a hazard . 
this is the first negative review of a product i have made . 
this bra is not strapless as advertised ,  and offers no support whatsoever . 
we threw the remaining buns away and will not buy this again . 
add to that it s not very pretty glitter . 
they price isn t bad so i didn t return it . 
i would like to find a bone that he won t destroy . 
if you have a cdrw drive the game will not even install properly . 
when you try and clean it; and it looks awful . 
i guess they made their money and don t care . 
i really had been looking forward to this product . 
especially because it s an rpg with little story exposition in the beginning . 
we followed the instructions and kept getting blinking red lights  error notification  . 
this game is confusing and boring much like civilization num_extend
i don t own one of these ,  thank goodness . 
the lace and pearls will peel off within a week . 
heats quickly but puts out only small amount of steam . 
i bought this for my husband who likes egg sandwiches . 
so i think the protection part has gone out the window . 
i have been using the battery for less than a years now . 
the roleplaying aspect is pretty interesting ,  though awfully shallow . 
this pen doesn t work very well at all . 
it is manufactured in chemical laboratories by mixing disodium phosphate and monosodium phosphate . 
then another company bought them and they re called ceramic tools . 
i bought this and i had to return it right away . 
it didn t get jumped on or abused by kids . 
if amazon does correct this i ll return and edit my review . 
no amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair . 
the remote ,  in my opinion ,  is completely useless . 
this is not what i had in mind . 
i bought him an ipod nano and dock instead . 
this is a very bad quality material product . 
i guess i was just hoping for something different . 
it was too narrow and wouldn t grip my hair . 
i think this is a very bad wireless mouse . 
this game ignored everything it could have learned from halo . 
i purchased the backbeats originally for running and exercise . 
player s are able to change jobs as in the original ff num_extend
i used to use them to fall asleep . 
she liked the taste ,  but that was about it . 
probably not a relevant review today ,  but still not worth your money . 
see a doctor instead of taking this witch s brew concoction . 
he didn t smell like dog urine ,  but cat urine . 
it has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial . 
so i had to stop using it ,  which i was sad about . 
these chuxs are thin and not absorbent and very poor quality . 
the unique fact that it was mirror like was whathad intrigued me initially . 
i thought these would come in handy with the  extra  measuring cup . 
and i havnt really found the styling to be very practical either . 
i bought a sos pad just for it . 
my recommendation is to simply plan ahead and buy the flcan . 
deviation from the actual product isn t even allowed on amazon . 
at $ for replacement pans ,  it s just not cost effective . 
the filters were less than impressive as well . 
this was the first time that i ever sent anything back . 
i really dont like the rest of the kit . 
i like stainless steel pans and have many . 
this product made my skin feel even drier when i was wearing it . 
but i bought it for the purpose to glow in the dark . 
olay . i started on may num_extend right after taking a `before  photo . 
owned one of these for over ten years ,  worked great . 
they come off too easily in little cat teeth . 
the second thing i didn t like was the fit . 
but there is also a height requirement on this that is not listed . 
so a fall in that are will damage or scratch ur device . 
olds would not find this game too innovative or challenging . 
this product doesn t deliver the hold that i need . 
unfortunately ,  the motor never ran an even speed . 
one day when i am num_num i hope to have played the game . 
i have an ant problem in my kitchen right next to my sink . 
so i thought it would be ok for me spray more . 
i threw my num_extend glove away as i never did wear them out . 
it didn t do anything for me but smells good . 
they are very small for a size num_extend
glorious sound !  reproduced in all it s surround sound glory . 
squeezing out air as you roll the zipped end . 
i m diabetic ,  so i always check the ingredient list for sugar . 
i used it for browsing and calling a little bit more than normal . 
also this immediately sinks to bottom has no mixing in water . 
i would still be very cautious when flushing litter however . 
in the end ,  they are just silly rubber balls . 
i rinsed her well and towel dryed her . 
but it just didn t do it for us . 
neither the usb nor the dock connectors fit tightly . 
well ill be sticking to buying them at my local beauty supply store . 
also if you accidentally screw it too high ,  it will not retract . 
and i love showing them my photos from my last vacation . 
the door bell on the front of the house works . 
there was no way the bra was going to work for me . 
as for caffeine ,  it seems to have a very negligible amount . 
it wouldn t charge and only contained num_num percent . 
i ordered two more sets and started using the first last week . 
the sony num_extend produces the finest pitch you can find on any tv . 
this installed in num_num minutes without even bothering with software . 
the base response is nonexistent ,  as is the comfort . 
google  cube num_num you  for some excellent cubes . 
i will stick with that brand for now . 
even the human enemies have only two types . 
and it was very light . enter ,  the new num_extend
test it and return it to the p . o . 
so sadly these will not be a treat for my baby . 
i used it for a week then hand washed it . 
it s not curl your hair and made from cheap material . 
i was not impressed with this product and gave it to my girlfriend . 
i purchased this because it was rated so high . 
my first issue with the product is its dry consistancy . 
indeed ,  that is what my cell phone advised . 
i had a great sad lite but it was so huge . 
bought this to keep my son s wrestling gear together . 
unfortunately ,  this was not the case with my purchase in february of num_extend
soap was a powder ,  at least much of it was . 
so ,  basically ,  you are stuck with only one car that works . 
there must not be any antibacterial in this soap . 
straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about num_num feet . 
i m happy i didn t buy the big sister to this lens . 
it doesn t matter what setting i am playing on . 
but then again ,  so does plain old num_extend with a microfiber towel . 
the lens arrived already opened and the lens was loose . 
i ended up using all three trying to get it right . 
i learned about harvest moon :  a wonderful life from a younger friend . 
but it does not smooth out the foundation . 
i bought this to keep my japanese spitz occupied ,  no good . 
i wanted my money back ,  not another poorly made unit . 
a more detailed description would have helped to make an informed decision . 
originally after i bought these headphones i really liked them . 
also when powering on the unit i have noticed static some times . 
my three persian cats love the laser toys . 
i now use tropiclean and they seem to like this product better . 
from the pictures i assumed this was made of glass . 
my only consolation is that i purchased this toy on sale for only $
i don t own these but saw them at a flea market . 
of the three major systems ,  it s the bulkiest . 
absolutely did nothing but make the vicinity smell like lime . 
i will probably try another one ,  but it better show up whole . 
if i change my mind ,  ill change this review . 
i love all of the previous final fantasy games . 
i have tried several products to help eliminate the pest in my yard . 
the only problem was that it did not fit on my dryer . 
but it s just not meant for regular use . 
i purchased this belt hoping to lose a few inches across my midsection . 
this headset was great after i bought it . 
i was hopeful in this product when i ordered it . 
how wrong !  the two sides are free swinging at the slightest touch . 
and every one of them is also % coffee . 
however ,  within one day ,  the polder was off by num_num degrees . 
no intro ,  nothing to show what is going on or why . 
however ,  firmware update num_extend has a wpa bug . 
but when i bought the last box i started paying it more attention . 
the music from the old num_extend mario games were much more spirited . 
never tried cedar wood ,  i don;t personally like the smell . 
with this price ,  you cant really ask for more . 
i really liked both of those but not this one . 
he really liked them and wore them a lot . 
belkin support does not have any troubleshooting or information their website . 
it is still out of stock there and here . 
life smelled of roses . he kept using it through the day . 
too many places where the cut scene can not be bypassed . 
i consume lots of seeds ,  beans ,  grains ,  vegetables ,  etc . 
its good only for tv audio . the battery life is ok . 
even the cheap progresso clam chowder at costco is tastier than this . 
this kit is impossible to use and is not worth the money . 
and this time the itching was unbearable right away . 
cord is way too short ,  that is my biggest issues here . 
my daughter received this for christmas and it looked like a cute concept . 
meanwhile i found them at cvs for $ a piece . 
i didn t think there would be a difference . 
i will suggest to buy two size smaller . 
they are also a little stiff and hard . 
i whiped it up and didn t give it another thought . 
i have been waiting since february for these red bumps to go away . 
i bought this product to boost our internet connection . 
i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise . 
i personally like milky makeup removers like vichy . 
i am so very disappointed in the quality . 
getting the finger sleeves out after taking them off required a dowel . 
i have tried everything posted on these reviews to no avail . 
this camera is a nice idea however it isn t worth a dime . 
too many other games out there that beat this game hands down . 
the material wears off pretty fast as well . 
its way to lose on the phone don t get it . 
fyi num_num start i consider to be a kind rating . 
on the plus side ,  it does seem well made on the outside . 
i have numerous keen s both hiking and sandals . 
the plastic grows a slimy film of bacteria . 
still nothing . so now i am finally going to retire this machine . 
num_extend to receive num_extend worth of still not pos . 
the smarts are all on the tablet side . 
he loves putting the balls in it and loves pulling it around . 
i was almost killed by a substituted medication from mexico . 
definitely noticed how it helps me sleep much deeper . 
these are not the docs i normally wear . 
this marinade just did not suit my tastebuds . 
maybe it only works for people with thinner hair to begin with . 
i ve worked as a computer tech support consultant for years . 
i kept wondering when i would get to the fun part . 
i would say this is a bad value . 
i found the operation of this device somewhat confusing . 
i tried this tea for num_num days over a period of two weeks . 
i got this at bestbuy for five bucks  after rebate  . 
i am subject to static discharges year round . 
i looked forward to this game for so long . 
drop was on a sidewalk but from only num_num ft . 
apparently he is a professional  blitz ball  player whatever the hell that is . 
i honestly don t get what the big deal is with this product . 
one sizefits most is not a ladies size for sure . 
do not recommend this deer urine they call lotion to anyone !  . 
buy levis because it is a trusted brand . 
people always get out of the way on time . 
i thought it would stabilize my knee ,  but does not do this . 
much too small for even a medium size counter . 
if your num_num dies ,  so does your ability to play movies . 
this is the third time i edit this review . 
i have had this keyboard for over num_num months and am very disappointed . 
this product states it is for guns up to num_num magnum . 
not to mention it felt like i was taking off my skin . 
produces a lot of flow in the small tank . 
num_extend the water never gets hot; luke warm coffee aint fun . 
if you truly love ages of empire you can like this game . 
at first ,  i thought there was something wrong with my unit . 
sound quality may even be superior ,  but i can t tell . 
the num_extend some love it ,  some hate it . 
if i hold them in ,  it sounds amazing . 
those will be what u need and will give more stars . 
if not ,  it s garbage and has to be thrown away . 
its just a piece of some tough paper glued on the back . 
i am looking to by sand bag style shooting rests . 
also ,  the  strategy  of course isn t really strategy . 
even then you do not always get what was pictured . 
do not waste your money on this stuff . 
for example ,  they say the blackberry curve will work with it . 
there is nothing on top of the case to hold the phone in . 
i had a west bend timer for years . 
this game is too old to work on todays os s . 
i received the headphones today and hooked everything up per the instructions . 
as long as you are near a window ,  the reception is great . 
examples include dragon ball z and excite truck . 
it is not even close to a hp or mac laptop sound quality . 
this skin cream is strongly scented ,  causing my allergies to act up . 
the notes on the recorder are the same way . 
no visible holes; it had never been used before . 
i grew up with gerber ,  sad to see . 
infact ,  i think it may make my hair feel worse  :    . 
go through live internet update to version num_extend still no driver for it . 
even connected it to another phone and it still jumped . 
after using this tool my hair is left looking fried out . 
the shipping was fast but the cover is just cheaply made . 
 options  doesn t give you a path to the settings . 
with the smallest of the num_num not much larger than my hand . 
it is orange ,  not brown and rather goofy looking . 
while on the phone talking to them ,  the dvd player broke . 
now ddiii has a few familiar moves ,  but lacks in them . 
however ,  before banjo consults him ,  he can t do a thing . 
to me this is the worst game that gran turismo has ever released . 
i don t know what i was thinking buying this piece of junk . 
for the price you d think the would be higher quality . 
if racing is your interest ,  check out wipeout fusion as an alternative . 
i ve never had that in a bra before . 
there might be some of you out there . 
it refers to the neighborhood  pleasantview  as  pleasantville  . 
and the new zealand supplement for yeast kolorex . 
i guess the one i wrote about above was a defect . 
i always made sure i empty it after each use . 
the nylon material is also very thin and almost translucent . 
a failed product in my eyes and a waste of money . 
i needed these to open a hp sleekbook also a old ipod touch . 
and then it s over before you know it . 
i like using motion controls on wii games meant for motion control . 
not quite so instant ,  and not so accurate either . 
this product does not work on my hair as described . 
you really cheaped out what was a great design . 
don t waste your money if your over num_num ft tall !  . 
the plug does not fit well and allows the ball to deflate quickly . 
i love playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one . 
the maker says it is sweetened by honey ,  glucose and sucrose . 
i do not like the control feature on this at all . 
the taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar . 
i cannot recommend these headphones and have a clear conscience . 
the socks are adorable ,  but the toe seams are thick and uncomfortable . 
i m afraid to actually microwave anything on these plates . 
my dermatologist laughed when i told her i tried this product . 
several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic . 
it doesn t stand on very well and covers nothing . 
this router maybe not good enough ,  so i give it two stars . 
all you press is x occasionally num_extend but it is repetitive and uninspired . 
i have been doing this for years and it works flawlessly . 
i think the product itself has a bad smell . 
now i have the simple low end non pulsing model . 
blew out in num_num weeks and is now utterly useless . 
vitamin d deficiency has been declared a national pandemic . 
there is no way it fits a regular sized adult woman . 
didn t work at all except to move forward . 
i m glad it works for some people ,  but not for me . 
on my cheeks and forehead it worked great . 
i am disappointed  cos i have never associated nokia with poor manufacturing standards . 
the harness btw is okay ,  def runs smalls . 
it was overpriced and poor quality ,  design ,  and instructions . 
i won t bother retyping what they already say . 
the puppy will do % of the talking . 
contrary to other reviewers ,  mine has lasted for about num_num years . 
the velcro on the doors are stapled ,  fine . 
a really bad design flaw in my opinion . 
you must test ferritin levels if you are taking cod liver oil . 
i think it rusted away taking the tape with it . 
it has left a bad after taste for num_num days now . 
they are more expensive but some things are worth paying for . 
this is for the hardier consumer ,  taste wise . 
i thought it was just the newness of the grill . 
if it doesn t say  made in the usa  don t buy it . 
i sent it back and got an xl which fit perfect . 
i got it for a friend because the seaband was too tight . 
the bag is pretty sturdy and has a nice handle . 
the squeaker goes out fairly quickly as well . 
i felt as if i may have had a slight increase in energy . 
we purchased the luna ball after reading the reviews . 
there are the goths ,  the artsy people etc . 
my toddler sons enjoyed playing hot wheels on it . 
it seems to be only weakening it also . 
i ve noticed no difference with using this product . 
little did i know this stuff stinks !  !  it s horrible . 
but there are three problems that are a deal breaker for num_extend
maybe it just didn t work for my hair type . 
i have no idea what they were thinking when they made this version . 
it said leave on for no more than num_num hours . 
i don t understand why some people love this game . 
shipping was num_num weeks ,  and unlike the photo this has been repainted . 
these were recommended by my physical therapist after i had my foot reconstructed . 
it was added effort for each meal to have to do . 
next size down tried in store didn t fit either . 
for the price it wasn t worth my time to return it . 
we got the mvp num_num baseball game from ea sports . 
i was advised to walk around often and to turn my ankles . 
i went thru two of these items in two years . 
i used this as a steam liner for some gyoja . 
the foam just collapses completely when you sit on it . 
the lace gets dirty easily and starts to peel off on the edges . 
needless to say ,  the kids were disappointed and the adults were frustrated . 
i can t think of any redeeming qualities that this games possesses . 
i understand coca cola has bought zico out . 
lucky this wasn t a gift for a boy . 
i deal with seniors num_extend so this is totally unacceptable . 
the manual linked from this page is for the num_extend not the num_extend
if you are buying this for long time storage forget it . 
i just wanted to replace the dead units from my old accord . 
if the replacement goes bad ,  i am not giving cuisinart another chance . 
there is a technique to attaching the larger earbud . 
even the lens cover pops off when putting the camera into the case . 
this is a can opener built to last for generations . 
so there is definitely a defect in these machines . 
the screen was well washed twice and still ruined the yogurt . 
but truly has no power as i expected . 
again ,  i ran into the same problem as before . 
this product is not as much and easy to use . 
not worth the $ i paid for it . 
so you can hold your phone in landscape or portrait . 
you can kill all of the enemies armies which leaves his plot open . 
thanks to the first unit ,  i knew this was not normal . 
amazon actually sent me the real cables to go cable . 
some didn t even have a tag at all . 
the second one ,  left a little bubble on one side . 
but he would also love a flying paperback book . 
claims to help burn fat ,  but that definitely did not happen . 
he once asked me to hide it because it was too loud . 
she said she looked for the film and couldn t find . 
but otherwise ,  its a num_num star rating for now . 
using samsung galaxy nexus and samsung smart tv . 
maybe it s on psn ? ahem ,  on a much brighter note . 
does not stand up to chewing at all well . 
however ,  the product itself is designed to fluff up hair . 
however ,  i trusted the reviews for this item . 
some of the products had an ok smell but this was unbearable . 
i had it for two days and the buckle was broke . 
it s messy and doesn t absorb very well either . 
buy a low end no name speakers and get more sound . 
ordered num_extend unit and it did the same thing . 
this was not what i expected at all . 
this workbook has very few worksheets in it so just letting people know . 
the replays are completly the opposite of what the announcer is saying . 
it takes num_num tablespoons in milk to make an num_num oz . 
i think they re selling a bunch of their returned units . 
the keyboard layout is great and the mouse has some good options . 
normally ,  trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades . 
it feels pretty good on the skin and i like the texture . 
not as good as i was made to believe . 
i hope they abandon this storyline for the next game and start over . 
the taste is milder ,  and actually not as sour as the clementine . 
i don t even think this headset is recyclable !  . 
i rinsed and rinsed ,  and tried using less with no avail . 
there were no apparent cracks in the base . 
they were new and sealed in package with use by date of september num_extend
doesn  t do it for me at all . 
she s outside for one to two hours a day . 
i am currently using it and i absolutely love it !  . 
its hard to curl so you just have to keep it straight . 
so it upsets me a bit that these socks were falsely advertised . 
i did not get the promised num_extend oz . 
i ve had better results with much cheaper products . 
this piller is much larger than it appear . 
this shoe is great for going out when you will be stiing alot . 
you can not get a good aerobic workout using this stepper ,  esp . 
installed this drive to upgrade a num_extend hd on a relatives computer . 
boy ,  was i wrong !  !  i regret buying this liquid garbage . 
invest in higher end products and we get better supplies . louiev . 
i previously purchased lemon verbena and find it very refreshing . 
maybe it would have been better with a mac . 
it just sat on my hair and that s about it . 
no match for my nine month old german shepherd puppy . 
the rest of the features just don t cut it . 
you know they are aware of so many complaints . 
rarely do i write bad reviews of a product . 
it squeaked ,  it bounced ,  and probably felt softer than his nylabone . 
sadly this one not what i had expected . 
it works but i think it could be built better . 
they call it soft splat technology ,  it isn t at all . 
i am giving him these sparingly when he seems stressed . 
i have tried num_num other organic crackers here on amazon . 
i have sensitive skin and perhaps that was the problem . 
set up wasn t too difficult   dish network   just a bit time consuming . 
lcd monitor is not good ,  tough to see anything on in sunlight . 
but after the first shave i was not happy . 
my advice ?  go to the humane society and get a cat . 
a few weeks after that an arm snapped off . 
don t even waste your money on a rental . 
it worked well ,  but started leaking shortly after we purchased it . 
i guess i was expecting too much from these . 
this  collection  doesnt even allow you to play all the games listed . 
i wouldn t buy this because of the sugar content . 
this controller is undoubtedly the biggest pos ever made . 
these clips are decently solid but quite short . 
for some reason this plug does not always work in num_extend
they had num_num tables set up ,  two of which were trackmaster . 
i have a round bowl ,  and it does not fit . 
i have panasonic and have used panasonic headsets previously . 
the boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer . 
i stuck my finger in num_num inch and it was hot . 
i returned these shoes as they were not comfortable . 
this shirt is pretty and in great detail . 
however ,  i was very upset with this product . 
they look just fine when i place them in the machine . 
this gloves started off well but they don t last long . 
agreed with other buyer ,  looks like a toy and cheap . 
i bought num_num num_num feet cables back in april . 
the lightning mcqueen eye panel was stitched in upside down . 
which is only bad because they aren t cheap . 
if i didn t have to pay shipping ,  i would return it . 
i have a feeling they will make good on this . 
i feel like i ve been duped by the kardashian marketing machine . 
had i bought this locally i would return it . 
he simply will not eat his food with nupro . 
this charger did not work for my samsung sii phone . 
but that does not seem to be the case . 
i was constantly changing batteries to get the phone to work . 
also i think the size runs a bit small . 
i really wonder about the good reviews this seat cover gets . 
it worked well to give me a comfortable energy boost . 
i do not believe they are from hanes or fruit of the loom . 
since then i have searched for anything similar . 
i was not happy with the results with this . 
before ,  it was an option after the fact . 
i read the reviews on this pretty thoroughly before purchasing it . 
i don t see what the hype is all about ,  honestly . 
and that isn t nearly far enough . don t get this game . 
he never quite got the  dropping the balls in the bowl  part . 
the problem is keeping track of the adapter . 
there is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work . 
it took me quite awhile to find the ingredients for rephresh vaginal gel . 
for me ,  it only increased the mucus flow . 
you need to brace it with other fingers to press it . 
my second ,  this one ,  lasted for num_num months . 
i will keep taking it and write back more . 
but i needed very large cookie sheets so i had no choice . 
i have owned a number of russell shorts through the years . 
nfl num_extend and nfl num_extend were great on the dreamcast . 
the coffee press is made in china with all that this indicates . 
mine did multiple times no matter how tightly i screwed it back . 
my finger does the same thing as this product . 
as soon as i recieved this i used it . 
they love stashing it so it s worth replacing . 
you cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go . 
in terms of innovation or orginality ,  there is none . 
so i question whether this is actually from samsung . 
i had to give away all of my e size replacement filters . 
bummer seiko sent me back to casio again . 
and i was given a refurbished one in return . 
i would not buy this model  or probably any vcr from rca  again . 
when i first put it on her ,  she wouldn t move . 
unfortunately it only deals with num_num letter words . 
and the story line didn t seem to make any sense to me . 
this game has a great idea behind it . 
it is unbelievable in every sense of the word . 
the num_extend  version num_extend cable modem is not linksys  best product . 
imo ,  not nearly worth the money or the hassle . 
claw actually works only half of the time . 
i have replaced the battery but still have the same problem . 
the neverwinter nights series may be a better choice for you . 
it should only take a few minutes to do . 
my husband is usually rough on socks though . 
but now you need to stop because some wolves are attacking you . 
i gave this serum a good chance to work . 
i will continue use a bottles of water i buy at the market . 
i spent in total around $ in high hopes of playing online . 
don t buy these with the expectation they are even somewhat rugged . 
gv jeans are great ,  if you can find the right size . 
pretty simple economics num_num when your film business is going to the dogs . 
i wish you better luck with this product than i had . 
in fact ,  the hats appear to be  seconds  with stitching irregularities . 
omega num_extend epa dha are the way to go . 
very hard to drink after a workout ,  in our opinion . 
i would say this does nothing to enhance the sound . 
i would recommend a magnetic or glow board for ease of use . 
the one i received looked nothing like the one on the picture . 
this dish is good if your cat is a mountain lion . 
when i called customer service ,  they said that was just too bad . 
i love dark chocolate and ginger cookies ,  so the combination was enticing . 
and ,  like the fun ,  the game stopped as abrubtly . 
however i was not prepared for the glaring failings i encountered . 
i just finished playing this game last night . 
i just wanted a causal racing game that didn t involve power ups . 
found another holster that was smaller that i liked better . 
and you guys d better make sure this never happens again . 
i bought this for my num_num week old kitten . 
first of all ,  there is zero flexibility when walking . 
i was so suprised they didn t raise the front a little more . 
please make sure you do not buy the version that has starforce . 
i ve read way too many stories of similar failures . 
not much more i can say about it . 
you would shake it and annoying sounds emitted from it . 
the bottom if the norpro funnel is sharp . 
the size listed on these socks is wrong . 
basically ,  if its on the floor ,  its fair game . 
suave is one of the cheaper shampoos out there . 
i just started my love affair with essential oils . 
it also has too much garlic for my taste . 
i just don t like the features of this stand at all . 
the other one is fine and is loud and sturdy . 
these energizer only lasted a few days before failure . 
it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion . 
i tried it second ,  and still didn t improve my lashes . 
the smell is not enticing and the taste is flat . 
i received the gel when i thought i ordered the cream . 
i will finish it up but i would not buy again . 
anyway ,  picture is good when the subject is still . 
i bought these in num_num different sizes trying to find the right one . 
my cats eat their cat food so it seemed like a good choice . 
too bad it just doesn t sound very good . 
i work in search and rescue ,  training every week . 
% total curcuminoids  num_num mgginger extract  zingiber officinale   rhizome   min . 
the glass cracked when uninstalling it as well just seemed poorly made . 
but it makes me kind of angry too . 
it was enough to distract me from what i was hearing . 
i purchased a nookcolor a couple of months after it came out . 
everything went perfect with the installation ,  until i put the thermostat on . 
i bought it off amazon here and when it arrived i dug in . 
inside circumference   not diameter   at elbow is num_num inches . 
needless to say ,  i stopped using the sunscreen . 
it s innovative too ,  the only important thing the num_extend ever had . 
our oven mitts are stained badly with it . 
this design is nice but the overall silverware is thin . 
ff x looks a lot better than this game . 
possibly because its made for a child not an adult . 
i got the shampoo and conditioner sample of this in the mail . 
regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution . 
this never worked on my device at all; no sound . 
once charged ,  it does not last as num_extend
its a great idea ,  but this one sucks !  . 
service was great ,  and this one worked fine . 
we ended up going to walmart and buying a regular tee . 
the quests are fun and grouping is fun . 
i received some pretty nasty splinters just pulling it out of the box . 
majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not . 
also the handle is pretty cheap feeling . now onto the maker itself . 
we trimmed it a bit and it worked great . 
this is a hollow toy ,  not made for strong chewers . 
my experiences with b+w filters are not positive . 
used as a replacement  can t find the original  . 
maybe it will kill a few rats at the dump . 
i am annoyed because first it does not work at all . 
my lenmar num_extend batteries and sanyo eneloop batteries hold up much better . 
i have worn this shoe for num_num yrs . 
i m sure she ll have hours of fun with it . 
it did not appear to be constructed with any lasting longevity in mind . 
i wear a num_num medium ,  these are huge and stiff . 
i will stick with my nail tek ,  a wonderful product . 
followed all the instruction on filling and charging . 
ended up purchasing food dishes for my dog at walmart  :   . 
the cleaning was not very good ,  better results with car wash suds . 
tried to heat up a plate of food . 
the ability to create a player ,  follow and shape his career . 
% of the time it stopped charging for no reason . 
i bought this as a gift for a good friend who has dogs . 
if you can find a good ceramics rollers are a way better . 
if get pregnant i will edit this review . 
seams look like they will rip the first time you use it . 
they stay clear of the corner of the tank where its hung . 
then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle . 
this royal jelly had no effect whatsoever on me . 
also the panning is not very fluid ,  but rather jerky . 
if it works ,  i will update my review . 
to top it off ,  they don t accept returns . 
one of them scratched ,  another one showed scuff marks from ordinary use . 
it smears like crazy and does not last at all . oh well . 
this tea is terrible; cheap store tea bags taste better . 
seriously ,  i have always wanted one of these puzzle storage units . 
makes your phones ringtones and alerts sound muffled and just horrible . 
num_num minutes later you see him rowing a boat . 
we eat lots and lots of olives at our house . 
tow hangs off side and width is very narrow . 
i plan to replace mine with ablendtecof  will it blend ?   fame . 
they were my favorites of the entire pack . cinnabon almonds . 
i guess if it ain t broke don t fix it . 
a week or so before that the cable stopped working . 
well ,  it wasn t quite what i had hoped . 
the consistency actually kind of irks me out . 
the original headset that came with my xbox num_num was great . 
if the second unit fails ,  i will not repurchase again . 
i left it plugged in over night and the battery never charged up . 
it s not as crunchy as a thin mint . 
the num_extend and the num_extend both suffer at low light levels . 
it s very obnoxious . a better option is the fluval num_extend
bought in january num_num and broken already last week . 
i have a tether cord on my flash not just in case . 
amazon is taking them back and will refund my money . 
if you re an acne sufferer ,  i d highly recommend something else . 
its also great at collecting dust and grit . 
it s a weight vest that adds weight to your num_extend
both of my cats would not eat it . 
you don t need red dye ,  and shouldn t use it . 
it smells like a house at christmas time . 
but if you re over that squishes down to nothing . 
the chunks inside the drink to not help either . 
it is not confortable at all to travel with it . 
with kindle fire ,  you have to dig around to find them . 
i have just general aches in my shoulder and back from everyday life . 
case was exactly what we were looking for . 
i just bought it and am already planning on returning it . 
very disappointing and i should have known better . 
i learned this the hard way after first use ,  when everything num_extend
i stopped using it and skin cleared up . 
it is literally more trouble than it s worth . 
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing . 
that has not helped me to get this sticker off . 
ok ,  this looks good but doesn t really work . 
it was amazon s reviews that helped make a decision to buy . 
i was being very careful so i don t know what happened there . 
i bought the special addition of this game as well . 
i just think that her perfume smells really ,  really bad . 
i have had better luck with my osterizer blender . 
did not work well in attempting to use as intended . 
comes in the same type of packaging used for cheap fireworks . 
it definitely was not abused or used in a sparsely ventilated area . 
they really work and allow the wine to last days longer . 
at first glance i thought the colors were great . 
i received this as a gift in august . 
i am just going to stick with buying them blue buffalo treats . 
you are definitely getting what you pay for for this one . 
i already owned num_num portable music playing units . 
purchased a set of these to replace originals in my num_num suv . 
i bought this pos at chinamart and tried it on in the house . 
i did not find the nonstick baking mat to work for me . 
i anded up letting it go down the drain . 
those resemble more of a better version of a gas station cappuccino . 
it sounded neat ,  but it failed at teaching him anything . 
cheap ones sometimes have issues especially with polarized glasses . 
i ll find another seller who honor s their product . 
i dont see any difference ,  hold for an hours at most . 
i ordered this product and was going to put in our toilet . 
a soft compound that would not be durable . 
this was not good moisturizer for my skin type . 
i was going to try living with this . 
another trust issue for me to work on . 
the foil in the centre does nothing but irritate the skin . 
she s been through several of them; i ve gone back to hoover . 
it is inexpensive but i don t recommend it !  . 
the second order had leaked out during shipping  about % of the product  . 
it would not be prudent to overspend by this much again . 
case fit the phone fine the first time i put it on . 
to go back to the symbian os ,  i felt confined . 
i m pretty upset bc this is one of my fav . 
talk about a sugar high .  .  !  ! no more for me . 
the only aroma did not smell like either ginger or mandarin to me . 
add sugar and half and half and you are ready to go . 
returned did not fit ,  so it seems unfair to rate this . 
so in other words it was very poorly put together . 
this is not the stuff you re looking for . 
walking my dog on a num_num ft leash made the collar nearly unusable . 
one of my skss would have ftf  failure to feed  every num_num round . 
except i get so annoyed every time i go wash my hair . 
these are very hard to get on rims . 
the timer s electronic parts ,  function ,  and design are excellent . 
bought this coffee maker in black less than a year ago . 
i m not happy with the fit at all . 
the only positive is that optically ,  the lenses are flawless . 
spend the extra $ so you will be happy . 
well not within the first num_num years of use anyway . 
the alcohol prep pads are very small but enough for small cuts . 
a little fruity . cons :  does not work for me . 
i will stick to a different clasp system . 
both he and his num_num year old brother found it entertaining . 
i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive . 
it would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor . 
beautiful stadiums filled with fans that at most times are full num_extend rendered . 
several of my friends use that with success . 
i found this with all four that i purchased . 
i enjoy the notes and appreciate the scent . 
i thought they would but i was wrong . 
haven t tried the monster icarplay yet but it maybe num_extend
i m actually stocking up on them as we speak . 
flimsy plastic :  very hard to use in the litter too . 
i quickly made a pot of starbucks and was sated . 
i was so loving having the retractable cable . 
with an analog stick ,  you slide all over the place . 
this game was so boring !  the puzzles were stupid . 
otherwise you risk buying fake ,  old ,  or tampered product . 
nice idea but i don t think i will buy these again . 
mine didn t work right out of the box . 
the hubby told me not to buy them ,  lol . 
i don t care for them . the taste is not that great . 
the scarf is also narrower than i imagined . 
the mitten molded to my hand after it was wet . 
this cable won t charge and won t transfer files . 
ratings are still biased towards the teams that spend the most money . 
my guy lives in them whenever he is not working . 
there s zero chance an evo would fit in this case . 
my husband modified it for our gerbils and worked great . 
seems to me a $ down the drain . 
it made watering the garden not so hard . 
i regret that amazon won t let me give them num_num stars . 
i suffer from acne and wear makeup every day . 
i would end up with bristles on my face while shaving . 
but the main reason why i prefer the rsvp spoons is the shape . 
the zipper hides away provided you can get it all the way up . 
the important puzzles are stacked at the end of the game . 
keep in mind ,  it s the american managers who still make decisions . 
not only that ,  but the loading times are unbelivably long . 
i have long hair past the middle of my back . 
although i really try ,  i cannot get good results with it . 
i purchased this set and the upgrade to this set straight from elf . 
great stuff ,  easy to clean ,  heats evenly etc . 
air seeps in and causes the product to congeal . 
which ,  feels very empty with my little laptop and additional items . 
i tentatively touched it myself and felt nothing . 
a normal press of the buttons does nothing . 
purchased these glove to use when dumping my tank on my rv . 
it never could do more than froth milk . 
what it s missing is the fun aspect of zombie shows . 
i personally liked panasonic s neutral sound on theirs . durability :  awful . 
i had low expectations for this based on the reviews posted here . 
i bought this for a note i and a note ii . 
edit :  i had to change my review from two stars to one . 
this thing is still cool looking ,  but not $ cool looking . 
from a scale of num_num to num_extend say a num_num  four  . 
not good for skinning game ,  cant chop wood or clear limbs . 
i got this product for $ during a sale at cvs . 
there are no patches on the company s website ,  either . 
i gave away all the unopened boxes to a food drive . 
buy if cheap enough but look around as this unit is nothing special . 
is that too much to ask ?  maybe it is . 
they are way too tight for your thumb ,  etc . 
i ,  for one ,  had to return the item . 
ok i loved this game at one time . 
this costs way too much for such little product . 
i dont understand all these rave reviews for it . 
the colors are vibrant ,  and it works just fine . 
i made the mistake of buying two pair . 
so ,  i donated it to a nonprofit thrift shop . 
it is so below the usualy ff standards . 
unfortunately ,  it just doesn t support like the heftier ones do . 
i replaced with premium ,  coated hoya filters and have no issues . 
and by point i mean they let you actually play the game . 
the first tube popped with a little pressure . 
twice so far the cd cake boxes were broken upon receipt . 
someone must have shaken the boxes violently while packing or shipping . 
this causes the bottle holders to dangle from the main pouch . 
besides that they are still made well and should last forever . 
the unit had become disassembled ,  and the tip dislodged into the lighter . 
talk about  getting this old bucket of bolts  going again . 
i like this company but this product just wasn t good . 
if i could give this num_extend i would . 
i don t quite understand this toy and neither do my cats . 
it smells like laundry detergent and cheap bar soap . 
garmin tech support insisted that there was obviously something wrong with my laptop . 
i m so glad i didn t spent much on this junk . 
my dogs were vehemently opposed to me using this stuff . 
i was always having to stop it to scrape the batter down . 
it worked the first time we plugged it in . 
this could then be transferred to other foods at subsequent cooking times . 
i feel like i ve thrown away my money !  !  . 
the num_num is far slower and less stable than other competitors . 
what an unpleasant surprise when i cooked some last night . 
but great customer service from the sportsman s guide . 
however ,  i get no picture on my monitor with this cable . 
i had to buy small lemons to get them to fit . 
the included cable was also similar but obviously not legit . 
old boy who was within the suggested weight range . 
to make a long story short ,  it is entirely worthless . 
i don t know how this got good reviews . 
that i lived is owing to my toughness . 
i only paid $ for the adapter so lesson learned . 
the sound is first class though ,  when working . 
it does nothing for my skin and i think it causes new breakouts . 
it would be much cheaper and just as effective . 
correction ,  only a few hours for my border collie . 
while this product wasn t awful ,  it was rather disappointing . 
it  warned  me off and on during my entire vacuum session . 
also there is not much diamond dust on the blades . 
so it looks like this is $ down the drain . 
thought this set of headphones was great when i got them last xmas num_extend
stay away and wait for something worth while . 
i raved about this brush the first day i got it . 
just in case any shoppers out there aren t sure what to expect . 
both broke at the hinges ,  just like everyone else s . 
uncomfortably small even though i ordered a size up . 
that s what i did with my new htc one and its great . 
this bird feeder is a total piece of crap . 
it comes with two ear hooks ,  but not two different sizes . 
this was a waste of money for us . 
which leaves me right back to where i left off . 
after checking the reviews at this point i returned it . 
i m on amazon today looking for a replacement for this . 
all i can say is that it didn t work for me . 
this game is of bad quality ,  not horrible ,  but bad . 
so i m docking an otherwise good game num_num stars . 
so bummed cause i will have to get a different one . 
they just blare the base and muddy the music at all times . 
the best things about it even make it worse . 
i couldn t wait to get a clear protector back on my phone . 
you can t get anything docked to it because is is so unstable . 
probably chemicals ,  because that is what is in most processed foods . 
they must be defective and amazon sent me a return label . 
but i did not take heed of this fowarning . 
the only real positive about this game is the graphics . 
also ,  what i can say great out this foundation is the finish . 
the game boy advance is clearly capable of it . 
not that great of flavor compared to other reviews . 
they will send you the old model only compatible with socket num_num and num_extend
this puppy is going back to the store . 
i am ordering another brand but i could not recommend this . 
one of the washers is held into place by a spring . 
they offered to send me a new one immediately . 
i thought possible the shipment was tainted with chemicals . 
picture of bag says  genuine hoover filter bags . 
i used it every day for a month . 
these were just as bad as all the rest . 
after setting it up ,  i returned it immediately . 
didn t smell as perfum reallydidn t smell ,  nor last . 
i would not have bought this except for the maxell name . 
finish has a strong product line of really good products . 
this is just regular soap with a mediated smell . 
waste of num_extend stars because it is a good concept . 
doesn t work with my phone if in a case . 
someone at kitchenaid needs to wake up and do something about this . 
i bought this with fond memories of my childhood lightbright . 
they may have well as called this game . 
you can build and deploy your own custom num_extend
too many bad things are coming out of this pet food company . 
my num_num year old daughter loves bubbles and received this for her birthday . 
it is just a simple punch and a cheap one at that . 
but this double rich chocolate has a cardboard like taste . 
they need to bend midway up the boot . 
it fills up its incredibly small dirt container quickly . 
this may not happen to you ,  but it happened to me . 
update :  i had previously given this product a high rating . 
the unit i received did not work properly . 
i was disappointed with the system and it can be very loud . 
the pin connector that plugs into the num_extend was damaged and loose . 
i gave the game back to game stop . 
it works as well and i am going flabby . 
even with a sauce i thought i was eating a dough ball . 
let me tell you ,  as an unmanaged switch ,  it works . 
needless to say i won t be using this anymore . 
i have no control of when my subscriptions happens . 
none of the cleaners broke ,  except this one . 
everytime my toddler ate this flavor he ended up getting sick . 
if we want skinny jeans we will buy num_extend disappointed !  . 
i ve had my orek since num_num without any problems . 
i don t trust it to give to my dog . 
the num_extend performs much better with much lower latency . 
i found the product of very cheap quality plastic . 
i need somthing with no wire but support is everything . 
i m packing it up ,  and shipping it back . 
i didn t feel any visceral joy in the process . 
kaboom !  !  eggs all over the microwave ,  cooked about %
my kid loves these things ,  but they are near impossible to clean . 
i ordered this and a month later it finally came in . 
maybe it would have fit better it was not a slide . 
over and over and over and over again . 
serious fire hazard if you have a gas range . 
i will donate it to a local shelter . 
it was dry and lumpy even after adding more liquid . 
there are much better alternatives out there for a dog to chew . 
after one weekend of playing ,  i almost completed everything . 
its just that their isn t anything special about it . 
supposedly both these loop straps would be on the exterior . 
i try and consume only small fish from reputable sources . 
and i m a player who can beat contra with one life . 
i would have been better off if i had ordered a size num_extend
thought i will try this based on the numerous good reviews it has . 
i have checked the buttons and everything seems to be put together well . 
and it s not like i have a very long torso or anything . 
it is such a thin thin thin case and very brittle . 
if it was made here ,  i might have requested repair . 
i bought this scale as a way to monitor my weight loss . 
i m not sure why ,  but it is very frustrating . 
when i returned after the phone call ,  it was completely gone . 
i purchased these to kill a problem squirrel with no success . 
cheap . bottom line : too much hassle over a simple device . 
i use gelish gel polish and nail cleaner . 
i probably plan to slowly smoke the rest of them . 
there was nothing to indicate that this was gotham city . 
i returned the item and purchased another product that i liked much better . 
within about five days ,  the outer balloon broke and fell off . 
this has happened on virtually every edge of both front and back parts . 
i purchased this cable when i received my droid incredible num_extend lte smartphone . 
this unit worked well for what it is; a handheld cb . 
we purchased another bag and it was fine . 
i love firefly as much as the next guy . 
i bought this card to go with my nikon num_extend
taste was good but not worth the effort . 
this one never worked quite right ,  it sort of wobbled . 
then wash the feeder ,  rinse well ,  refill and rehang . 
this must be amongst the worse of sony s normally great product designs . 
the box and the colors are great though !  . 
one of the worst investments i ever made . 
you d likely do better getting a separate knife and light . 
i d look for something else if i were you . 
i d rather not risk my dogs life ,  or health . 
i was not pleased with this product at all . 
when i bought this the little black cap to hold it came off . 
just added it to tank ,  hopefully it does what i need . 
it can spoil a good game of halo in an instant . 
extremely disappointed and now am left cooking a brisket without a thermometer . 
wife wears this daily for the past nine months . 
a very literal mess !  an  i wanted to cry  sort of mess . 
it will not cut through my teddy bear schichon s hair . 
tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon :  ph read num_extend
after our disastrous pool experience we are very glad we didn t . 
i ordered two of these cables and neither work . 
next tried num_num tabs side by side standing on end . 
and it was unusual how fast it was all happening . 
i had no idea about this product since i never needed it before . 
this toy is nearly impossible to transform even for adults . 
i ve been burned several times before buying their products . 
it also changes the texture of foods to wallpaper paste . 
i am a computer programmer and have half a dozen assorted computers . 
none of the other characters have much personality . 
so once you re done fumbling with the lights and getting the seals num_extend
i would recommend this product to no one . 
i cannot charge it nor utilize it in anyway . 
there was also a scratch on the back of it . 
but then that vanishes and something dreadful replaces it . 
while this seemed ok ,  it was not what i wanted . 
unfortunately i was feeling cheap when i decided to replace all my bulbs . 
he s also on an all dry food diet so water is important . 
and i wouldn t give this to my kids . 
i purchased a replacement and meticulously set it up per instructions . 
i bought this toy for my daughter s first birthday . 
needs a book under one leg to get it level . 
i had to do that in like num_num seconds . 
total time with this toy :  less than a week . 
the worst part is the collision detection part of the graphics engine . 
work work at all now ,  unless you hold the lever down . 
disappointed that it didn t last more than a couple months . 
the airplane seats num_num dolls but only comes with num_extend
americans tend to scrub the outside of pots as shiny as the inside . 
the didj was not a success for leapfrog . 
that is a better use for this phone . 
it has a coconutish smell with a grandma perfume . 
this also didn t stand up to humidity particularly well . 
the audio is very soft of this headset . 
i bought the primer to build up my lashes . 
the screen on my device had the  moisture  like glazed look . 
also ,  don t expect any help if you have a problem . 
i would recommend any of their other products . 
the nintendo ds says that all gba games play with the ds . 
judging by other reviews it s not just me . 
at least its not num_num of thier usual collectathons . 
i love that its thin and has a pen clip . 
the are good mice with accurate movement and everything one could ask for . 
i bought these batteries for an electronic dog collar . 
as if i hadn t used anything at all . 
i would compare it to herbal essence maybe . 
it smells like melting fiberglass or something similar ,  which seems very wrong . 
i d rather spend double the price on aerosol cans . 
i would not hesitate to call it chili soup . 
we love melissa and doug ,  but these paints were terrible . 
too bad that it just won t stay put . 
bonus was it was probably the easiest to get on ,  technique wise . 
i think this product works on specific types of hair . 
i only used it maybe about four or five times . 
i wish i had read these reviews before buying this . 
so i did and almost half a year later ,  nothing . 
after one months the near focus didn t work . 
you re num_num dollars is better spent on something else . 
i m not trying to approximate the sound of a studio recorder . 
check the internet ,  it can be a bad side effect . 
they are not made by johnson and johnson as the product page states . 
i don t know where these rave reviews are coming from . 
thesims has endless possibilities ,  while animal crossing is extremely limited . 
i am not what one might call an overly hyped video game player . 
absolutely hate it once the adhesive gave up in less than num_num months . 
just a few dollars less in my bank account . 
first immediate impression :  really sweet and artificial tasting . 
the ground objects are also out of proportion to the aircraft . 
some of the mini games are really fun i admit . 
just wouldn t want it for a whole two weeks worth of coffee . 
the bristles are way too soft to get under my nails . 
it took num_num years for my last razor s blades to dull . 
made me break out ,  red bumps then second i put it on . 
and all of this happens with that one five second load time . 
this coffee grinder essentially stopped working after a couple grinds . 
i purchased this from alernativewireles . com for my motorola droid num_num global . 
never falls on the floor like the kitchenaid used to . 
i would use this for about num_num minutes once a week . 
for $ you can get a comprable pair . 
the product i rec d from this company was watery . 
you can not count on this system for num_extend graphics . 
i returned this since he wasn t comfortable with it . 
they didn t work at all for our num_num month old german shepherd . 
i am a celiac with multiple food allergies . 
this is a great concept for a toy but cheaply made . 
i did not care for this product at all . 
i used it for awhile but then it chipped and looked like crap . 
quickly they both became frustrated with the pieces . 
it was very crappy material and we were very disappointed . 
they don t mention any of this on their website . 
horrible fit :  the device came with several different rubber earpiece tips . 
aside from that you will double your run time . 
it s impossible to train him properly when the fence is not consistent . 
they are very flimsy and the legs aren t even . 
they need make it where it last longer than it should . 
i seriously had to open a window after brewing this . 
i think an older child would enjoy it more . 
smelled okay ,  but didn t do anything for my eyes . 
we received a  refurbished  unit back in the mail . 
i purchased two of these collars and had to return both . 
costs more than just buying another tooth brush . 
third ,  there is only one boss ,  and he is very easy . 
very dispointed and have to deal with it . 
these few are also talked to in a low growly voice . 
ok ,  i m surprised that this unit is now over $
my toddler is crazy about the dinosaur train show . 
but now i am thinking of returning all of them . 
the terms bait and switch come to my mind . 
the trade off ?  i have pointy breasts like madonna . 
i despised having to open them as well . 
my two cats were not impressed with these . 
it also has a very strong odor that i didn t like . 
finally went back to comcast s splitter and all was well . 
i have had this headset for about three weeks . 
pet tabs have been a good product for years . 
i m sorely disappointed because my ipod earphones must have spoiled me . 
so this turntable looked perfect for what i was looking for . 
i wanted to give everything a try for my early teething baby . 
superman s health bar is actually a  favored gladiator bar  . 
this new formula is sheer ,  does not cover roots well . 
listen to the other reviews who rate it low . 
only the second time trying to use the watch and it was dead . 
this spray gave me nightmares and vivid ,  wild dreams . 
maybe you can make the saucepans first ,  then these ?  . 
after a few weeks i developed a swollen and irritated bottom lip . 
in addition ,  digital coaxial supports all the same formats as toslink too . 
it is irresponsible to produce products like this . 
the batteries will not stay connected if you move the device at all . 
not sure if it was me or sub . 
this phone is definitely for phone calls only . 
and yet it claims to be a low glycemic product . 
maybe too much to expect fpor a couple bucks . 
even my wife who drinks much more coffee than i disliked it . 
they are a little tight compared to other socks boasting the xl tag . 
all the pictures are useless and lacking quality . 
nothing works anymore and you get to pay for it all again . 
they have helped me more than prescription medicine when i have had coughs . 
which is one of the reasons it has never sold very well . 
it s also fairly unstable despite the well designed clip . 
i just thought they were such a neat idea . 
while i continue to try jm products ,  i consistently am underwhelmed . 
i much rather prefer the stevia packets instead . 
it has a drop down menu where you can configure the buttons . 
it works fine but it smells like burnt plastic . 
nothing amazing as far as a remote control . 
this is my least favorite game in the franchise . 
this mix is not worth spending calories on . 
didn t like the look of them when i took them out . 
felt dizzy ,  lightheaded ,  nauseous and just plain awful . 
lots of walking around whacking these creatures with a plank of wood . 
caveat emptor . i would give zero stars if it were an option . 
my friend bought a camera brush to clean the lens . 
i ve tried bending them back ,  smoothing them down ,  nothing works . 
and whereas the product description online said multisport ,  the packaging said baseball . 
or he just grabs one and calls it  annieclare  . 
i feel like the barrel is smaller than depicted . 
it helps make them move more smoothly and it protects them from water . 
i discovered it means a fermented dark tea . 
i decided to give this a try and was unfortunately very disappointed . 
ok ,  this used to be the best brand . 
if you buy this toy ,  try it out first . 
they add a protien to the silver partical to keep it suspended . 
they re the skin and fat from the base of the ear . 
i am disappointed and am buying a refractometer instead of another hydrometer . 
i have tried different sizes ,  but all had the same results . 
their specific theme songs from ocarina of time can be heard as well . 
so when i got there we discovered that the battery was no good . 
i have to wonder why that is ,  especially in organic milk . 
when using this i noticed my face would break out alot more . 
milwaukee and maurice williams scored practically every basket . 
you have to shake it a certain way or nothing happens . 
i thought maybe the problem was the wrong shade . 
either way ,  i am disappointed that the batteries went dead . 
i wish i had bought the one with the handle . 
it s also a repellent to me ,  as well .

the peice tht juts out goes into your ear . 
it is a terrible game and a waste of money . 
i got this and another chicago cutlery knife for my wife . 
i ended up ordering this scoop when i purchased a new food container . 
i would suggest stay away from this particular model . 
my son is num_num and absolutely loved this . 
good design ,  uses regular aa batteries  also can use rechargable aas  . 
this is good ,  however ,  for the eye area . 
the quality has gone from an a to an f . 
returned this shirt because it was not fit to be worn . 
the night i received the product ,  i immediately tried it . 
in fact ,  i cannot even get into the home page . 
how awesome !  gallery is accessible only through the belkin app itself . 
it was suppose to protect the phone which it did until it broke . 
well ,  i didn t read enough of these reviews before purchasing this . 
broke after minimum use after a couple of years . 
second ,  as someone also mentioned ,  no sixaxis control . 
les graphiques sont pas mieux que d autres dans num_extend
the black piece underneth is very difficult to get off . 
i didn t want to spend the same amount on shipping it back . 
this one does and in my opinion a big waste of hard earned $
looks like some of the jewelry is already turning . 
 vacuum insulation   is that what you call it ?   is useless . 
find if your network is on the num_extend subnet . 
i used every day for num_num weeks and nothing happened for me . 
not worth the $ that i once spent on them . 
i could have done as well in the dollar store . 
i got exactly the same problem as many of other victims had experienced . 
i tossed this product without even finishing it . 
yeah ! we ve had it for exactly three weeks today . 
to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways . 
these looked longer on the woman in the picture . 
i sent in a report onm this item from another entry . 
i will look elsewhere next time i am looking for headsets . 
the battery dies in a matter of months . 
if your cat does ,  perhaps this product would be of interest . 
i looked on nokia forum and everybody s complaining about the same issues . 
i loved this grinder until yesterday ,  when the grinder mechanism disintegrated . 
i love their ethics and will never buy anything but kong . 
at first the protective case fit my phone . 
i was hoping better and softer fabric quality but it was not . 
i paid less for this than two aaa batteries . 
purchased this case as it was recommended by the bow manufacturer . 
this little thing ,  my dogs just didn t enjoy . 
it was pasty in texture and taste even with rice milk . 
the material is pretty thin and they do not fit well . 
i bought bullet witch back in the fall of num_extend
they also don t have a good pouring lip like on some others . 
i mean do not purchase this game for keeps . 
regular conditioners make my hair silkier than this cream does . 
they are very utilitarian looking ,  like cheap diner glasses . 
for me it was free since i already had num_num of them . 
i am not keeping a game like this in my house . 
but ,  ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate . 
the lighter steel leeches a metallic smell and taste into food . 
maybe i got a lemon ,  i m not sure . 
this blueberry bar ,  however ,  has almost no flavor . 
it is airresponsible to produce products like this . 
the ramp is lightweight but that is the only saving grace . 
this is an over priced worthless rip off . 
the por kwan brand is much better ,  but . 
mine is a bit too snug ,  although it fits . 
there is only one major flaw with gameplay . 
its to bad i can t find another multi without iodine . 
we bout this for our son considering all the great reviews . 
still going to be forking over the $ for clinique gel . 
they should pay people for looking at this thing and skip buying it . 
to those of you with technical issues i feel for you . 
i purchased my minolta dimage num_extend new num_num years ago . 
this was for my sig num_extend medium sized harness . 
it s available for much cheaper elsewhere ,  as other commenters have said . 
on our first try ,  it popped % of the kernels . 
this does not give it a rustic look but instead looks sloppy . 
i saw no noticeable results and wasn t impressed . 
i have made the switch to cargo pants for life . 
the cheap price isn t always the best answer . 
this is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all . 
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board . 
we will get the full clip from my boyfriend s tackle box . 
the new fountain leaks around the motor housing . 
given that the game has very little replay value . 
they said they haven t had any similar complaints about this particular kettle . 
i installed this item on a vacation cabin . 
overall the design of this thing is absolutely wretched . 
cute idea ,  too bad it is a crock . 
on a rush day ,  i put conditioner in it and go . 
it tasted a little too dry to me . 
it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not . 
all the butterflies blow out in less than thirty seconds . 
i threw it up a few nights ago and gave up that night . 
we just had to spend money on a new bag . 
i have had the product for about num_num months . 
i get about num_num day of standby and num_num hour of talk time . 
i played it for num_num hours and then uninstalled it . 
it lathers really well with just a little gel . 
i have to agree with the others here . 
i never had this issue with my higher grade models . 
didn t do a thing to help with my dog s separation anxiety . 
this case was really weak and was not what i was looking for . 
this case was was not for me it is very very cheap . 
our cups have never seen the inside of a dishwasher . 
you start by dropping blocks to create a fortress . 
peter is not very strong and his health is drained fairly quickly . 
the fabric still looks as good as new . 
i guess i m missing something !  i had to return . 
the stockings are made of the same material . 
i need this for work and this was not the answer . 
they sent me num_num num_extend cent coupons for my next purchase   !   . 
i hate clay ,  but at least they use it . 
the game does have a great sense of humor though . 
and because of this ,  the manes fall off and get lost . 
it seemed as though the panty was a bit tight . 
you start by building a settlement ,  addressing basic needs and continue onward . 
you get what you pay for so i should not complain too much . 
the zipper broke in the exact fashion as the first . 
i have not found doggie disposable diapers yet that work !  . 
the buyer did not want to accept that this was the case . 
it clumps and is awful to put on . 
over num_num months had gone by and enough was enough . 
i was worried that would happen ,  and it sure did . 
i would expect a measuring cup to last a life time . 
after one single use this is not acceptable . 
i shook and stored it upside down and it did nothing . 
there s no map and no sense of directions . 
some people report accurate readings ,  mine have seemed off . 
i owned other canon products before from powershot cameras to this num_extend
she broke into tears after a short time . 
i would not purchase it again or recommend it to a friend . 
the graphics are straight out of num_num and the control options are sad . 
i bought this for chronic lower back pain . 
wish i d gotten the one with a small knob . 
they should survive at least several small surges without actually exploding inside . 
they don t grip nearly as well as my previous tweezers . 
i gave up and took the tube of my wheel . 
for an oxo product ,  i was quite disappointed . 
the game has good graphics ,  but bad sound effects . 
expect to buy another one in a few months . 
they are all blunt and simply do not cut at all . 
they also have some cheap plastic parts with rough finish . 
fortunately ,  i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med . 
not so pleased with this ,  the seller is fine ,  no prob . 
it shattered and flew everywhere in the kitchen . 
i threw these away after the dogs chocked a few down . 
there are too many other products on the market .  .  .  :   . 
its a great concept ,  but this product doesnt work with my foot . 
count me along with those that don t like this trackball . 
you can heal but it doesn t seem to do anything . 
the plastic where the band connects seems like it will break . 
he wanted this toy so badly from santa . 
it didn t burn or irritate my skin when i first applied . 
otherwise ,  it does not provide enough power to interact with your ipod . 
doesn t work for what it says its for . 
looks nice and seems to be very durable . 
well it had a hole in the seam . 
i wish i had looked at the reviews before hand . 
dungeons are very aggrivating ,  until you figure out what to do . 
she had this model several years ago ,  and they fit nice . 
and worst of all they come out horribly wrinkled . 
this is the second cheap cassette player i ve bought . 
i have a num_num inch waist and num_num inch hips . 
same day ,  same store ,  same shelf in num_extend
it is just a cheap immitation of a leading series . 
no more ants bothering my canaries or their babies . 
handle about the right size even though i have big hands . 
the first real dislike i had was the fake background . 
these cookies weren t even finished in our home ,  which rarely happens . 
more useful and less gaudy alternatives exist  like loofah sponges  . 
they work great to help keep the hotflashes at bay . 
i mean i can order adaptogens if i want them . 
i have tried everything to keep my arthritic dogs from throwing this up . 
this game is has many things wrong with it . 
a very weak link in an otherwise good product . 
it gets costly ,  because the disks are not cheap . 
upon further inspection it was marred prior to delivery . 
never before has hormones done this to me for num_num years . 
i screwed the other side on with no problem . 
old grandsons quickly became bored with it and now it s collecting dust . 
wii  six years before  ,  and ,  wait for it . 
it isn t my choice for a good brew . 
i most definitely recommend trying a different pair . 
i used to use this for my dog . 
my little one was right back to her feet itching and her biting . 
whenever the phone rings all wireless connections are dropped . 
too bad i didn t read the label before ingesting this product . 
they are certainly a healthy alternative ,  very crispy and fresh . 
never worked from the first day i had it . 
i ve since read about numerous complaints made about their batteries . 
they don t build them like they use to . 
they look nothing like the old beef tendons . 
i couldn t really tell if it made my mood better . 
very hard to get used to the buttons since they re so small . 
not worth the $ in my opinion as dollar shop has it cheaper . 
plastic handle is corrosion and somewhat slip num_extend
have long bodies that can t just walk inside with the entire body . 
and i mean the original side scroller version . 
i went down a cup size and still had too much room . 
when the box arrived ,  it was not factory sealed . 
if you want one that s military grade ,  look for something else . 
i think what most disappointed me was that the balls are stationary . 
if you get the popper ,  save the many unpopped kernels . 
we bought this for her because it looks like a ton of tags . 
it said it was a box of num_extend but there was only one . 
i had the communter for my motorola atrix and loved it . 
could not get these to go on without bubbles . 
for only a few months of ownership ,  it s been too unreliable . 
i bought these without first doing some research . 
i would not wear them out in public . 
because of this my phone easliy can slide out of my hand . 
the brief tore at the waist band after num_num wearings . 
i have always turned to rubbermaid but will not in the future . 
num_num  but without all the cool mario suits and less creative worlds  . 
very hard to discern the clues they are giving . 
well ,  i need to put my opinion to it . 
i ve had better arch support in a bedroom slipper . 
had to tell her to give it back to me . 
can t even work on it while plugged in . 
if you looking for something really fun try something a little easier . 
but the producers defiantly dropped the ball on this one . 
it simply has two small open grates on the top . 
the only good thing ?  amazon refunded my money without an issue . 
buy some regular chocolate spread and just eat a little of it . 
the only thing is you can t replace the dang water bottle . 
it was good while it lasted but it didnt last that long unfortunately . 
it doesnt even get that close and it misses hairs . 
i like the top and bottom covers a lot . 
it does not matter how gentle you are . 
alot of ideas were adopted from gta also . 
i hate screen protectors ,  especially crap ones like this . 
with maxwell house ,  i m just trying to get through the boxes . 
cheap construction ,  but i was expecting that for the price . 
i was so excited to get this product . 
it gets super hot when you use it on high . 
i should ve taken num_num of the reviewers advice and not buy it . 
i think i struggled through one day as the bottoms were very tight . 
living alone ,  i would describe my use of the cookware as  light  . 
follow up :  my dogs vomited after they ate these . 
they sew a tag into the heel and it s uncomfortable . 
i tried changing the batteries and it didn t matter . 
i had to throw my num_num year old yorkie s stockpile away . 
the cu was released with almost no substantive beta testing . 
i would not recommend it and i have tried many . 
i felt like i was pouring bleach into my eyes . 
all the key are different ,  gun sound are crap . 
as an avid soda drinker ,  i know what i like . 
when he asked for new shoes with more coverage . 
it is really behind the times on these areas . 
i never could get it to work well or get any accurate readings . 
i had high hopes because of all the reviews i read about it . 
he says that it does not quite work for him . 
money is a complete waste in the game . 
old ,  boring ,  hard to play and hard to control . 
they only thing worse than the product itself is philip s  service  . 
you might wonder why i kept at it . 
this was my first time making a purchase through this seller . 
i purchased this tuner in january ,  and it stayed in my car . 
it spins left ,  and you trim ,  and then it spins right . 
it s unpatriotic . i know what you re saying;  what the . 
then you are done and this spinning reel thing shows up . 
i use it when needed ,  not necessarily every night . 
i do feel jitters when taking the product . 
good fit ,  but color started rubbing off after two weeks . 
i got this barn for my num_num year old with her birthday money . 
as a result ,  i am returning this product . 
trust me do not go for this title . 
i am getting a roller attachment for my mixer . 
for some reason the collar and the remote do not stay connected . 
i have to play with it first to get the cat interested . 
i guess that is my recommendation for anyone looking to buy this case . 
then i found out that the connection to the mouthpiece leaks as well . 
i have used other models with the old style and caught num_num squirrels . 
but overall ,  this toy didn t work for us . 
and yes ,  i made sure it was properly fitted and closed . 
it s one of the coolest electric razors i ve seen . 
they are just too short to be chewed on their own . 
in fact some had the fur already pealing from the start . 
and i have micro scrubs that are soooo much better . 
you don t see games that go away from the mainstream these days . 
so to me buying this was a waste . 
i can t believe philips puts this product out . 
i thought i found the perfect aromasticks for my apartment . 
the helicopter takes ages to take off and then handles terribly . 
the easy bake oven was a disappointment on our first baking session . 
the size was ok and same as my regular size of num_extend
the rep then mailed me a free box of num_num cartons . 
the phone guy ,  though nice enough ,  was no help . 
all of a sudden ,  it wouldn t work any more . 
it s just not intresting to my son at all . 
if this is ok with you ,  go get it . 
the cracks are still there  just softer looking  . 
giving it a two star because of the snap breaking so easily . 
the chews are soft and easy to administer . 
the case itself is okay but not to my preference . 
it also takes num_num aa batteries and drains them extremely fast . 
it did not work as well as expected ,  but not sure why . 
you need a map to find all the buttons obviously just kidding  . 
this thing should be sold at the dollar tree . 
i ve never had a product irritate my skin . 
the games are just as deep  but there are over num_num of them  . 
distance in the center widthwise where the handle is; num_extend
when i plugged in thisusb adapter it installed the drivers successfully . 
so the lid is basically useless except for keeping bugs out . 
i was really excited to get it in the mail . 
which they could not guaranty would be gold . 
palm os based pda that has such a poor screen . 
i shouldn t have assumed that this would be cladded . 
second ,  this feeder is good for small birds only . 
also ,  akoya pearls have a nice ,  lustrous sheen . 
as part of the story line you have to lose your weapons . 
so ,  you could assume thatthis is for both types of pets . 
i have num_num button quail num_extend males; num_num females  . 
the coco hydro was weak and cummy tasting ,  salty . 
simply cant stand a conection for longer then num_num hours . 
i am disappointed i didn t heed their word  avoid  . 
it did not hold up well at all for me . 
i ordered this because i loved the color . 
i even tried placing it in the vitamix and remixing but nothing helps . 
i bought it mostly to cut french fries . 
my male just complains when he gets in the box . 
i really don t like the taste of whey powder . 
easy enough . the safer product just didn t work for me . 
pushing the stick all the way forward allows the player to run . 
my son likes the nail brush fish the best . 
i was really on the fence with purchasing this battery online . 
wow !  i am so impressed with the phillips company . 
the  no stress  part involves a labeled chess board and num_num playing cards . 
same thing with the old and fairly insecure wep encryption format . 
not really worth the money in my opinion . 
it s all jaggy and the controls are slow . 
my sil tried it and her num_extend fell off it in the wash . 
i kept pushing and i finally heard it barely squeak . 
only the littermaid litter worked for me with the elite . 
planetside can only be played online; there is no offline mode . 
sony uses its own music files called atrac . 
i knew that where there is smoke ,  there is fire . 
i like these shirts loose fitting and buy a slightly larger size . 
this was for my son who needs to focus and calm down . 
the tank tops are pretty thin and clingy . 
my husband had to set it up most of the time . 
tried it at home ,  with a boom box . 
all of my other dst ships num_extend num_extend look way better then this . 
so why not just charge using your own device . 
i really wanted to love illy issimo caffe expresso style drink . 
i am num_extend so perhaps the mouth guard is too small . 
go find the original unopened and a dreamcast . 
so much so that you can see the pattern from the security pattern . 
after disliking other natural litters i decided to try one more . 
some people may think it doesn t matter ,  but it does . 
the saying is true that you get what you pay for . 
it will then work for a few days and do it again . 
once i finish this product ,  i will not repurchase . 
so trust me when i say i ve tested them all . 
but on the third day the third pill i had a severe reaction . 
it did nothing and the mouse is still around . 
in this game you are only allowed to throw and hit . 
interesting concept ,  and it seems to work very well . 
i do have other galco products that are great . 
they need to let the nuns make the cake . 
i say if you like playing it online ,  go for it . 
although there is not nearly as much cgi as the trailer promised . 
when you start put all the cotton balls away . 
designed not to last and these fly terribly . 
often these timex watches hang around for so long that the battery dies . 
obviously nintendo s in this franchise for the money and only the money . 
if it holds two quarts ,  then it holds just barely that amount . 
the second tiffen uv filter i bought with new lens . 
i can t believe it contains as much of the herb as stated . 
these were the worst walnuts that i have ever eaten in my life . 
but i didn t buy this peeler for peeling tomatos anyway . 
these ingredients containing in this products did not go to my skin . 
i had this radio for six months when the button for presets broke . 
i had a frother thing that i bought for $ which was awesome . 
for $ i expected the product to live up to its billing . 
so in the mobile world ,  i m sure this would be helpful . 
i really really really wanted these to work . 
take this over and over and over again it just doesn t end . 
the callers did not ever hear the phone ring on their end . 
in this case you definitely don t get what you pay for . 
it s pretty much full on ,  or off !   :   . 
i turned and my elbow bumped his hands . 
i bought a set of reconditioned headphones from a different vendor . 
these ,  very expensive wustofs ,  and very cheap slitzers  see that review  . 
even in the slightest breeze it spills everywhere through the flower openings . 
i have oily skin and tend to break out . 
i thought we had found the perfect gift for our son . 
thankfully amazon customer service is wonderful and provided full refunds . 
they always feel like they are about to fall off of my head . 
the headphone acoustics isn t all that good in my opinion . 
i was sooooo disappointed when i received this watch . 
it has no added sugar and tons of b vitamins and probiotics . 
i would recommend the tweezerman black head remover over this . 
it is truly a shame . not worth the full purchase price . 
they dash for the door and sneak out when they can . 
our num_num year old lab destroyed this in less than num_num minutes . 
not really what you want or at least what i want . 
i will be hesitant to purchase another canon product . 
but this morning blend junk isn t any good at all . 
i think this is a total fake wen conditioner . 
extremely disappointed and have crossed this one off my list forever . 
chattanooga colpac ice pack num_extend item is used in my physical therapy clinic . 
it is so bad i stopped using after one time . 
maybe when she gets bigger ,  i may try adult orijin . 
my six year old really ,  really wanted this costume . 
so ,  i tried again ,  lowering the cooking time to num_num minute . 
i bought this because my olypus was back at the factory . 
the nfc does not work when i use this battery . 
i ve eaten hot dogs that have less calories and fat than that . 
i am by no means an audiophile ,  but these are unacceptable . 
besides this ,  they look fine and well made . 
i m updating my review after using the espresso maker after a while . 
disappointed in the shock absorbency of the sole . 
this game was pretty simple and got boring quickly . 
apparently ,  this is a known issue for them . 
sucks ,  never worked ,  hated it ,  threw it away . 
it simply didn t grind the coffee at all . 
a really dirty chain needs to be soaked in solvent . 
this was just a little bump ,  not a big hit . 
when playing online you and your teammates move like a fixed bitmap . 
at first i thought it was a a decent canteen . 
the fit was barely ok with some looseness on the top . 
then a few days later it refused to switch on and is dead . 
it s mild so not super obvious but it is there . 
i ve even tried contacting the manufacturer with photos ,  with no response . 
there s no documentation for setting up windows num_num to work with it . 
spend the extra money and purchase the kitchenaid . 
i purchased this samsung phone cover for my sprint galaxy s ii phone . 
this is colemans version of a thermoelectric product . 
the problem is with the inconsistent shape of the skirt . 
the sound is good ,  but game play could of been better . 
you re better off with honey nut cheerios ,  imo . 
it does work however the sensor seems a bit too sensitive . 
 have never experienced headache  slept for num_num hours and felt better . 
the wet n wild brow kit is a lot more pigmented than this . 
i ve had to scale down to a logitech optical mouse instead . 
so one use it worked ,  the second use the battery spray failed . 
the problem for me is ,  will it work . 
it charges my phone on and off now . 
these treats are very hard and apparently not very tasty . 
this spice tower is the epitemy of bad design . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
my son enjoyed playing with this and yes ,  sucking on the pegs . 
i have been using hydroxatone for over a month . 
as others have noted ,  the speakers pick up radio frequency interference . 
i would invest the extra money in a canon lens . 
i bought this at the suggestion of my chiropractor . 
for over a day i had foggy ,  irritated vision . 
it s a great size ,  perfect for soups and pasta . 
perhaps the photo was confusing because it shows the big toe . 
or ,  i d put the sippy cup spout on a bottle . 
this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for !  . 
we are now in the market for something that works . 
a worthy experiment ,  but i m going back to clairol . 
i wish they would have made it easier to slip on and off . 
it s a nice brown not orange at all . 
they clean better and don t irritate my scalp at all . 
seriously ,  there is no need to look any further . 
i bought this as a gift for my wife . 
i have two rat terriers ,  num_num and num_num lbs . 
i like the fact that it brews directly into a mug for you . 
see how long it takes to remove the white num_extend
it is the worst calphalon pan i have ever purchased . 
on nancy drew you just go from one puzzle to another . 
this foam roller doesn t hold it s shape at all . 
do not recommend unless you are over num_num years old . 
i found the carpet balloon racing way too gimmicky . 
pay a little more for num_extend and you wont regreat it . 
this keyboard has the annoying habit of repeating letters . 
the plug doesn t make good contact in charge mode . 
i do subscribe and save on several compleats . 
it does not make my hair soft at all . 
to do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice . 
if you are insistant on num_extend try another brand or different strength . 
not sure how long they have stored the product . 
this could have really been a saving grace for the game . 
low frequency was pretty good on the num_extend
it is not my soundcard because it worked with my other speakers . 
my daughter borrows my iphone to watch youtube on the rear seat . 
trendnet makes num_extend models and they make usb models . 
the remaining stock should be burned in a pyre by the fcc . 
i guess try another inverter and probably another cobra . 
great phone for a smart phone user on a budget . 
i would highly recommend the sneaky snacky squirrel game over this . 
in fact i d say it s bad even as a temporary solution . 
then ,  take a hose and wash it down with soap and water . 
made my hair dry and brittle with first use . 
or perhaps the sauce packet hadn t dissolved all the way . 
i love amazon ,  they should not sell trash like this . 
the handle ,  fulcrum ,  and scoop body are all fine . 
even on the hard settings ,  i had no problem . 
hopefully my experience with that pair will turn out better . 
felt like putting petroleum jelly on my face . 
filter is white on outside and the width is different . 
but now when i press the powerlock feature it feels very wimpy . 
i have used many lipstick sealer and this one is just okay . 
this is my second review of smackdown vs . 
i tried with two phones with the same result . 
i go through a pair of batteries pretty much every couple of weeks . 
its a shame the fda does not regulate these companies . 
senseo makes a much better single serve coffee maker . 
these are just do not get it done . 
i really have my doubts about this thing . 
teach these guys a lesson by not buying this game . 
don t buy this comb ,  i plan to return mine !  . 
i def . dont think its worth the money tho . 
you couldn t see the screen from your reflection . 
each are kind of weak with water only . 
the addition of olive oil seemed like an odd choice to me . 
i should have returned it ,  but i did not . 
it doesn t have anything to adjust the air or bubbles . 
as far as when it s dark ,  i really liked it . 
the carry case is the best part and that is junk too . 
not the quality material i am accustomed from a champion product . 
i bought petco s bag dispensers to replace firstrax . 
everything i read talked about the ultra s  hotspot  capability . 
 seems amazon does not list the most recent reviews under the product description  . 
 :  my previous purchase was the one without the frankincense and myrrh . 
i have long ,  thick ,  wavy hair that s prone to frizziness . 
but i should have heeded the reviews about flimsiness . 
it s basically just a puzzle that makes random noises . 
i first read about this product in first magazine for women . 
i have stopped taking this product because i don t see any results . 
will probably go back to my old grocery bags !  . 
i think other reviews have said the same thing . 
returned it and bought a different brand which has been very accurate . 
it s too bad ,  because they appear to be so nice . 
this brow definer looked too fake when i applied it to my eyebrows . 
we were at the vets because it caused inflammation and lots of vomiting . 
my little boy has kinda turned up his nose at this flat mouse . 
i have ordered these exact sweat pants before . 
i was hoping that the good reviews would outweigh the bad ones . 
great headset ,  so good ,  my wife stole it . 
that is ,  you go into the first room ,  kill everything there . 
the product does protect my galaxy num_extend very well though . 
i ordered the large for a medium size eski mix . 
it will be a strong contender when i purchase a new one . 
i am much happier with the stainless replacements . 
stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers . 
think i will cut my loses and try another brand . 
if it were ,  one would think it would be clearly stated . 
i installed these speakers in my num_num honda civic num_extend
tried jojoba and this one ,  but still ,  too thick . 
this also made it hard to get the kids in and out . 
do yourself a favor and don t buy this !  !  !  !  . 
the case was flimsy and didn t hold very well to my phone . 
so i bought wellness healthy weight dry cat food for adult cats instead . 
i bought this for my granddaughter and she doesn t really like it . 
the only fun things where hardly ever presented . 
i purchase this product based on the great reviews here . 
i find it to look thick and way to yellow . 
chromatic aberrations  ca  are pervasive from the center to the edges . 
additionally ,  it is really a two handed operation just to pour from . 
this is good for people who are very careful with their phones . 
the fit is very secure and protects the phone quite well . 
what used to be a large ,  nowadays seems to be extra small . 
the cord is not coming out of the lightning side . 
a friend of mine let me try this . 
buying this face lotion was not a good idea . 
it s not stainless steel as it must be for the intended use . 
it is sad and i am just furious over sigma s qa . 
the second reader would read some pc cards but not others . 
i also noticed a vacuum issue where the water would not refill . 
i bought this for my num_num gig ipod . 
i much rather have purchased this for my dog to chew on . 
accuracy is critical and they get some use . 
like many many other reviews have said ,  this is simply not durable . 
this food is like the junk food of the fish food aisle . 
no ,  i had to go and buy it . 
not like the games we grew up with . 
i bought this headset to replace my beloved bluefox num_extend
however ,  she seemed to think the rock was a toy for her . 
kind of hard to get the pens in and out . 
it actually might be easier just to go out and get that one . 
tried it with another phone and another computer . 
it s quite annoying for me and possibly for the dog as well . 
you don t know your status in the charging mode . 
i thought this was for the old atari system num_extend
gives the battery not connect red message which means it has faulty cells . 
i bought this stuff for my num_num willys jeep . 
but the design is nice and can make your kids happy . 
i have stomach issues and have to watch what i eat . 
the plastic always seemed too weak and honestly i knew this would happen . 
i wish i could attach the picture of the bread this machine made . 
when i picked it up the spray button didn t work anymore . 
give it away because i found it to much of a bother . 
sure glad that pig crap is hard to get to !  . 
well ,  it should have been called extra long ,  not extra large . 
a lot cheaper ,  more reliable ,  and fewer headaches . 
it took just about num_num months for the scars to go away . 
i should get it in a day or two . 
it works well and does exactly what it s supposed to . 
i contacted the manufacturer and after three weeks nothing . 
there s too much space in the pocket the tablet sits in . 
the twenty odd professions allowed for every character to become unique . 
even though this costs more than culinary teas ,  it is worth it . 
i bougth num_num end up throwing it away . 
i m losing an inordinate amount of hair with these products . 
maps are num_num times bigger than the old diablo . 
plus the unit overheats the coffee and grounds run down the side continuously . 
if i didn t like this product so much i would switch brands . 
it stinks ,  it really does after a few workouts . 
has an unpleasant medicinal smell to it ,  very harsh . 
the colors were not bold at all ,  it was just blah . 
the beep of mechanical life was absent and the screen was totally blank . 
it smells pretty potent and sometimes it burns a little . 
this came with my park chain cleaning kit . 
it looks like num_extend sea foam green refrigerators . 
will return the second one for a full refund . 
however ,  this phone barely does anything and is quite boring . 
i tried to use but found too cumbersome and uncomfortable . 
the audio is timely and keeps with the gameplay very well . 
this product turned my hair into a dry dull orange bush . 
the rack is cool looking and pretty durable . 
returning it the same day i got it . 
i pushed it in one time ,  then pulled it out . 
i think the reason is due to the shape of the glass . 
put a straightening comb on the end ,  and i m set . 
never played this much because of the lame control schematics . 
then i bought the same from some place else . 
it doesn t make enough noise or  do  anything . 
i just saw this toy at my friend s hose . 
if you want a real war simulation ,  buy operation flashpoint . 
pushing soft rubber into hard plastic just does not work . 
they did a relatively good job making it universal . 
well i don t know what i was hoping for . 
i was really hoping that this product would work for me . 
this toy has limited interest for my son . 
it s tj s columbian for me from here on out !  . 
after every use we dusted and cleaned it completely . 
then it hurts my hair to pull it into place . 
it is almost impossible to find completely waterproof boots . 
the back on all these also gets quite hot . 
i bought this for a beach trip just hoping to help . 
in retrospect a call to yakima would have been smarter . 
  if there is any little kids like that . 
however ,  it is similar to the newer models . 
i was very disappointed that i purchased this . 
it needs solid ground to keep from rolling you backwards . 
however the connectors rarely make a good connection . 
we used it about num_num times and are not satisfied . 
first i read the instructions to set up the access point . 
we have had it for about num_num months now . 
instead he send me a garment bag marked from some photographer s organization . 
will go back to powder when they are gone . 
we bought orinially to brew our own coffee . 
has a bitter undertone and a chalky texture . 
if you love golf games this is a must buy . 
i ve had mophie cases before and they worked well . 
the problem is in its full execution ,  this game sucks . 
taking it down to one star from two stars . 
so once a week ,  you have to correct the time . 
cute as could be ,  but not worth the wait or the buck . 
it was overly sweet and a strange orange flavor . 
it s time to pass this game to my other cousin . 
i will say that mio is very convenient . 
so of course ,  i have to buy a new one . 
it is on high speed and is only good on cool days . 
it didnt come with the additional ear hooks which i really needed . 
knowing who to kill will be frustrating as well . 
sudoku mania is broken because its puzzles do not have unique solutions . 
so it was num_num bucks down the tubes . 
this should be called mush in a can . 
after using more expensive knives this knife feels cheap and flimsy . 
the product came on time ,  but i m not happy with it . 
the pads have almost no moisture to them at all . 
i don t think it did anything for my nails . 
i m actually writing this review on behalf of my father . 
but ,  we all buy things taking the manufacturer at their word . 
i thought i would love vera wang s princess . 
maybe its just me but these levis were not anything like i expected . 
other reviews said to use and do chest exercise . 
its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing . 
and that attracts ants ,  armies of tiny ,  biting ants . 
i emailed hodgson mill and they tried to blame amazon . 
i loved the color but not a good quality at all . 
this kit has no read directions and no real tools . 
i got a small construction staple stuck in my tire . 
this new stuff doesn t do anything for me at all . 
how much did that  hassle  cost them ?  ?  ?  who knows . 
all the tools on the tire lever end came sliding out . 
still ,  not a single boss offered any form of challenge . 
if a cat won t eat it ,  it certainly isn t effective . 
i tried to replace but they won t stand behind it . 
i m wondering if this stuff is actually toxic . 
anyways after a couple months i kept finding my phone dead after charging . 
the giraffe is absolutely adorable but just sits among his other toys . 
if i never scarred before ,  i was scarring now . 
i wish i had bought the $ one . 
also ditch the huge scop they provide and use a num_num tablespoon one . 
my guys normally love catnip but this is a dud . 
if you re looking for a good basketball game ,  i suggest getting num_extend
my sister lives in a  light green  area which means  moderate reception  . 
so i know it works just not those with pigmentation in skin . 
the posts are short and hurt my ears . 
i love paying $ for something that works for three days . 
needless to say i skipped wearing them after the first time . 
this one will torcher even the biggest fan of cliched characters . 
for me a poached egg is a soft yoke and firm whites . 
they change gameplay often making it not as fun . 
there are much better mio products than sweet tea . 
behind the scenes isn t operating on your level . 
just received these rings as part of my order from amazon . 
the product will float on top of the milk . 
if protection is all that you need then this product is for you . 
sent it back it was to small what your bowl size . 
it did not help me like i thought it would . 
i installed it on my windows num_num laptop . 
 unable to ascertain if this optic is water ,  fog or shock proof  . 
it does not have even a hing of smell of tea tree oil . 
my scalp also started to itch a bit after use . 
these are among the worst i have tried . 
power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening . 
the product says dual link right in the title . 
i might sell my copy for about num_num bucks . 
i would recommend this product to people on the shorter side . 
so much for the hot water i thought i had . 
i did try one cup ,  though ,  and it s absolutely flavorless . 
and you shouldn t get stuck on the first level . 
the product runs small and the fabric is flimsy in the hip area . 
this did lessen over the month ,  but was still there . 
game wasn t for me ,  but maybe it is for you . 
trying to find a good ,  prosumer burr grinder is a daunting task . 
it was supposed to be new ,  but arrived looking scratched and used . 
plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles !   :   . 
the one i got was about num_num inches long . 
if you are not able ,  refund the price . 
the failure comes through in the aforementioned combat . 
i seem to just run into random problems with this phone . 
hopefully the other screens don t have as many air pockets . 
what did work for me  and may not work for you  was florastor . 
looking at the pics i thought it was . 
i may though and if i do i will report how it goes . 
if you re after a rpg ,  then look somewhere else . 
yes it looks very nice and it s somewhat compact . 
about num_num years ago ,  koss sold a similar design . 
but this thing is a horribly wasteful way to kill a single num_extend
she much rather hear a story or a sentence . 
finishing it up by mixing with hot cocoa . 
this product does not work with windows vista . 
but to push the icons ,  it works each time . 
it lastest only a few hours of therapy . 
i got the same machine from walmart for $
we have the older white version and the previous version of stoppers . 
there was no extra bass nor extra treble . 
this one creates more work than what other reviewers are saying . 
parts of the images would not develop or would show up discolored . 
not a good feeling once you take it off . 
i wish they would bring back the old slimquick . 
just don t buy it if it s being offered by westview traders . 
i used this on a vintage chair from the num_extend
each level or scene ,  has about num_num stunts to do . 
it starts out pretty interestingly but slumps down quickly and never returns . 
not a small rip but at least an inch . 
kids say the game rules when they havn t even played it . 
i think it is the kind of oil they are using . 
i had high expectations of this product because of the great reviews . 
and it s a pain to keep changing batteries . 
i will exchange it for another as it got very good reviews . 
these allowed me to precisely set the ball and toe width . 
anyway ,  heed the advice on this knife regarding it dying . 
so i began going to specialty shops to get my coffee . 
i love febreze products and had high hopes for this system . 
i have trashed it and will never look to otterbox again . 
i switched to ecover dishwasher tabs and have had no problems or complaints . 
i have come to enjoy the extra size and weight though . 
i just took it back off shortly after applying it . 
and i m not even certain that wheat is an essential ingredient . 
it is drinkable ,  i just don t see myself doing very often . 
overall the num_num is one of the best filters especially for the price . 
the stand by light stays on but theres nobody home . 
no building and gathering resources in these missions . 
i just hate the smell and the mess it makes . 
it really sounded nice ,  not computerized and not cold . 
i m just glad i got a few showers out of it . 
how is this healthy when it s loaded with sugar . 
as it is you re letting your self in for some frustrating moments . 
i delayed buying the white ones for that reason . 
however this coffee is ground ,  according to the package ,  extra fine . 
i could smell the soap through the packaging . 
i will think twice before buying a soffe product again . 
idoubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by gemavenue . 
worked as advertized but the swappable prongs made the whole unit unstable . 
worth a try for the price but lfmf . 
the shoe is fine but it s just too small . 
num_num lb of this is about num_extend fists full for me . 
multiple dings that have been badly painted over . 
i bought the usr num_num wireless router on a sunday afternoon . 
would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti . 
this is the first rpg i couldn t finish . 
now that they re nearly $ i m not so sure . 
looks like i am going to buy my old one again . 
the one i recieved is the newer  crulesque  bottle . 
i bought this hoping it could stand up to my dog . 
of course i got the girly purple color . 
it doesn t feel like it s doing anything for me . 
it also cut off circulation to my feet and left them numb feeling . 
a watch of this price should last longer than a year . 
had to return num_num different styles of this company s knee braces . 
you constantly have to monitor and adjust it . 
i sent it back becasue it was not what i was expecting . 
this tastes like a mixture of wet leaves and stale cinnamon . 
i ve tried plugging many cords into antenna jack . 
it was unfortunate that i was not able to wear this product . 
how to use this pump ,  based on my num_extend
i measured this myself and came up num_num feet short . 
i find myself walking right through some objects . 
i didn t find anything special about this product . 
our golden loved ripping it apart about num_num mins . 
as i had no expectations i can t complain too much . 
not much power ,  and the food gets caught in the bottom . 
one of my friends picked up a copy of spore . 
i didn t want to deal with it every day . 
this is our second one ,  they stop working pretty quickly . 
you cannot  and should not  return under garments . 
while attempting to do this ,  bits fall off everywhere . 
sim card worked fine on another unlocked nokia phone . 
and no you don t get to freeroam with venom . 
this just isn t much fun for the kids . 
i rewashed my hair immediately to get the product out . 
there are way better deals then this guy . 
being so snug ,  it was hard to put on and take off . 
at first my hair felt nice and stretched . 
all i can say is it should have become fun faster . 
it was ,  it failed after num_num months use . 
this means you have to go through many levels a second time . 
i love using cell phone pens but i like the larger ones . 
other than that ,  they might be good for the right phone . 
cheap so its good as a filler for free shipping . 
not a lot of applications that are useable . 
uau !  i am surprised with how so small it is . 
you have more time to explore the town . 
it is very hard to blend in to your skin . 
and go get beached or caught in a net . 
it was ruined within a half hour of getting it home . 
a recurring problem when reading the product descriptions . 
it fits well ,  but is hanging on a peg in our bathroom . 
some of the coffee packets were not sealed well . 
the gameplay is ok ,  but kind of confusing to learn at first . 
it does not adjust down ,  even at the feet of the device . 
i have decided to just pay to have watch bands adjusted . 
it s ok ,  but i would not buy it again . 
after having it for a few months the tip has started to deform . 
the battery didnt work and i tried charging overnight ,  etc . 
some of the voice acting was great ,  and funny . 
i was looking for a num_num button mouse to replace my old one . 
we have loved the motions products for the most part . 
i applied the buttercreme while my hair was wet . 
of course patching isn t a strong point either . 
they were able to chew through the plastic as its not very durable . 
on the box ,  it touts  comfort  and  ease of use  . 
they pretty well play anything we through at them . 
i grudgingly give num_num stars as it is apparently washable and reusable . 
the kernels are very small ,  much smaller than movie theater popcorn . 
i finally talked him into stop wasting our money for this supplement . 
it might be able to cut through some english muffins . 
the second time i applied it i mixed with apple cider vinegar . 
the tender morsels are even too hard or maybe the product was old . 
the plastic is just as bad and could damage their insides . 
the xela aramosticks provide an okay scent and looks decorative . 
i m getting almost num_num charges before the itorch needs to be recharged . 
it just isn t fun and i plan on taking it back . 
from my understanding ,  this product is of very high quality . 
there is no way on earth that could separate these pots now . 
 walking back and forth to the house each time  . 
it is much less comfortable than it should be . 
blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general . 
perhaps we don t have the attention span for this toy !  . 
it dries my hair though and it doesn t look completely horrifying . 
this dog toy does not stand up to chewing . 
the other good thing is it came with a cork trivet . 
it s way too expensive when you can get carmex for a buck . 
this makes the cost of the tube ridiculous . 
the fingers are too short and too close together to help at all . 
for $ bucks i would of expected something better than this . 
dog likes it so if it were bigger it might be better . 
there is so much static in it that i hate it . 
this doesn t fit my outside filter for my rv . 
the characters aren t fluid and everything seems forces . 
it didn t do a good job of pulling me in . 
i ve tried several different flavors and they all turn my stomach . 
but one bite and i wanted to spit it out . 
it is impossible to exfoliate with cotton pillows . 
i ve heard about gta for years and how great the games are . 
you will be fighting on an open battlefield in the outdoors . 
they are very firm and chewy more than gummy . 
i ordered cocktail bling but received bobbing for baubles . 
i was very upset and will not purchase again . 
my jrt mix pretty much rips up every toy we give him . 
copper is flaking off almost every bb in the entire bottle . 
i stopped using when i bought more fish to try to reduce stress . 
this cover gives you a false sense of protection . 
after a month ,  i could see no difference . 
lots of ganja and cigarettes are smoked on a daily basis . 
i wasn t even able to give this product a chance . 
thankfully ,  i managed to reconfigure it myself to get it to work . 
i purchased it to cover my acne scars and hide my dark circles . 
plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days . 
i use britta pitchers all of the time . 
if you drop it on your foot ,  oh ,  that ll hurt . 
he claimed that only the wireless portion should work . 
all reasonable so i followed their instruction and sent the requested information . 
the description should reflect the color ,  this is important too . 
not the steak or pork chop sauce i thought it might be . 
i grew up eating the puffed rice in the big bags . 
i would not recommend if you have one . 
never have i experienced socks as horrible as these . 
we go through first aid supplies like oprah goes throughspanx power panties shapewear . 
it was so thin and so super pale . 
the brush gets hot fast so be prepared . 
the features and html interface turned out to be decent . 
buy some regular caramel spread and just eat a little of it . 
several of my plates and a couple saucers have done that . 
needless to say these just weren t the right teva sandals for me . 
bought this to replace griffen num_extend vent mount which worked very well . 
but otherwise ,  i hate to be so negative ,  but steer clear . 
while taking this i still took evening primrose oil and fish oil . 
this is okay for chopping cilantro ,  but does not puree very well . 
i assumed they would be about half the size of the large ones . 
i stopped using it because it hurts when i putted on my nails . 
i phoned olay and they are sending a coupon to purchase another product . 
this drink is almost like a cross between tums and alka seltzer . 
she liked the cookies ,  but we didn t really notice a change . 
bought this game because it got such stellar comments . 
i wanted to like this coffee ,  i did . 
i have tried to put her on it ,  she walks away . 
had issues with item ,  case is very cheaply made . 
i opened it up and tested the battery . 
i was afraid i was going to lose a finger . 
i was hoping that since the item is expensive it would actually work . 
i didn t know these were not built by braun . 
i bought this to help reduce the wrinkles around my eyes . 
the shepherd just likes to dig and bury them . 
this camera developed an autofocus problem during warranty and was fixed . 
so much for listening to music while i mow . 
it s visible indoors in dim lighting  forget an outdoor range  . 
i can t even begin to tell you how useless this product is . 
highly uncomfortable ,  way too bulky and leave your mouth open at night . 
its well constructed and no issues with image quality . 
i always end up with a backache after using this . 
the iron requires a really hot temp ,  which concerns me . 
i purchased this straightener after reading the reviews . 
i would not recommend it for aggressive chewers . 
i was quite disappointed when i received this . 
they sent me a coupon for a free filter if i bought one . 
i had not been to the netgears users group before . 
light blue had nothing that i liked about it . 
i will never buy anything again that needs these worthless things . 
it can not be cleaned from either side . 
i m not even sure that it s cloth tape as advertised . 
i have it and plan to finish it . 
after two washes ,  the logo has an unattractive grey tint to it . 
the gun in question is from the early num_extend
i had to have something . i did a lot of research . 
unfortunately ,  all of the photos i took look the same . 
i had my droid x replaced by the droid num_extend under warranty . 
i bought this along with the shampoo and the regrowth oil . 
it a complete waste of money to buy this . 
it s supposed to help with headache ,  congestion ,  allergic reaction . 
the seat of the pants has a round patch of fabric . 
i did this about num_num times with absolutely no effects . 
i took one bite and it was so sugary i tossed it . 
no problem ,  i thought ,  i ll just turn it off now . 
the third one did not have a working indiglo light . 
we bought this particular product from amazon for the last num_num years . 
love the toy but you have to keep pressing for each note . 
a small square of pheromones is in a separate packet . 
before ,  i simply purchased it from the drug store . 
i could not even give the tea away . 
needless to say ,  we don t use these any more . 
but i guess you get what you pay for . 
the controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable . 
easy to hook up and that s were it ends . 
five times through this mess is enough for anybody . 
i couldn t stand it no matter what i added to it . 
he has never been interested in cuddling or using it in pretend play . 
it adds an edge to any dress or top . 
you might like it more than i did . 
these parts do snap back in quite easily . 
the british accent on supposed asian characters was a distraction . 
i put on my otterbox and set it and forget it . 
bad handling ,  low horsepower ,  slippery tires ,  you name it . 
i would not purchase this product off of the internet . 
don t waste the money ,  even if it is cheap . 
she got the lamb yesterday for her birthday . 
that gets everything hot before the coffee brews . 
i am up for the new challenges  but not this .  .  .   . 
i didn t care for it as a leave in on wet hair . 
i have num_num kids and we were using batteries like crazy . 
it s not the most clear glass ,  but it works . 
ours was wobbling within a week and completely broke in a month . 
foreign chemicals are not something i want to eat . 
black currants are an ingredient and are quite dangerous for dogs . 
it was cheaply made and tore right away . 
i initially bot the big boys at $ each . 
i ve used lots of different kinds of mice to alleviate finger pains . 
all canned tomatoes are in bpa lined cans per government regulations . 
i did love the look of it and that s about it . 
the  quick charging  ability of the headset is also greatly exaggerated . 
i let the unit sit overnight ,  same results the next day . 
some of the pieces were only num_num inches long ,  others being over num_extend
this set is going to the thrift store tomorrow . 
as new headphones ,  they are a bit bright overall . 
but i was very disappointed to find that it was only  surface washable  . 
that dispute is still pending . this is a terrible company . 
the cat was described as  orange  and no other information was given . 
i rebooted twice more and finally it worked properly . 
they are the worst part of this game . 
the photo shows a folding handle all metal handle frypan . 
do not buy if you want the original one by apple . 
it is the toe box area that just kills my feet . 
i got these tubes at the bike shop for $ each . 
i have two corgis and one loves it the other not so much . 
i would certainly consider investing in something more useful than this piece . 
this product works fine on an ipod touch . 
when first tasting it ,  it does taste very good . 
will probably use up the jar on just spot areas . 
last night i installed the seidio battery that is comparable to this one . 
don t waste your money  ,  to small for even small potatos . 
my main complaint is with the front wheels . 
would send it back ,  but just not worth the hassle . 
jada pinket is hot and fun to play . 
i wrote a review about this product before i got it . 
it s not thick at all if you use half a cup . 
the sound quality is very low; worst than most fm broadcasts . 
i bought this to reduce the number of outlets i needed . 
seemed like the best deal at first until i tried skinomi skin protectors . 
the eyeshadow didn t suck it wasn t very good though . 
i am on my third one of these access points now . 
we don t buy fad toys but this was gifted to us . 
until i get up at num_num am to scoop poo . 
my second impression is % juice just doesn t taste good carbonated . 
it is the same model that is on amazon . com  mr . 
a different brand that was aluminum had the same problem . 
this is not for old ,  arthritic fingers at all . 
you cant even do the num_num or west coast with rey mysterio . 
they are far superior to these horrible headsets in every way . 
it has no suspension ,  so you feel every bump . 
then the temperature would come back after several minutes . 
it also does not do a good job of separating lashes . 
the battery compartment and lid do not show the battery polarity when inserted . 
i should have ordered the num_extend which i never wear . 
trying to avoid cps and its impossible since it s in everything . 
i was attracted to the programming choices and lack of commercials . 
but the one i got was not suede . 
it barely gives you any color and what it does is just streaky . 
play the game twice and you ve gone through them all . 
the claimed directional mic sensitivity is worse than human num_extend
num_num calories from fat and num_num calories from protein . 
this pump requires excessive pressure to pump ,  even at low pressure . 
it had received pretty good reviews on several beauty blogs . 
product left a nasty gunge film on the sensor . 
if you do ,  it is going to be prestine . 
the device failed to hold my phone in place . 
but have fun trying to shoot that light . 
it either does those longer slices or really tiny . 
i bought this toy for my lab and sharpie . 
but these guys get a score of num_extend
it seems that many products become trash when they become american . 
no explanation is given as to why zombies suddenly appear . 
i checked it a couple of weeks ago and it was $
i cannot understand how the third unit smelled as bad as the others . 
it s unfortunate because it is quite a pretty case . 
if your cat likes them ,  this is a good thing . 
if you give a mouse an ipod he will want headphones to . 
this is not a capri pant in the way women have capri pants . 
so i sent them back and got some others that work . 
i am long time wustof user and have many sets of these . 
none of the characters have a connection you can relate to . 
the biggest complaint one can muster is of the control scheme . 
tell us what the lights on the modem are doing . 
my hairdresser gave this to me to try . 
benefit i might think twice using any pyrethrin products on her . 
now i wish i d bought the gaggia instead . 
when i barked into it ,  it wouldn t even go off . 
really wanted a classy looking wood high step ladder . 
i was just looking for a whistle when i first bought this . 
he loves planes ,  so i thought this would be great for him . 
but the worse part is the cups ,  they are not smooth . 
for me it roland was a waste of money . 
i like that they are sharp but their a little bit to sharp . 
when they dump with it they have to hold the bucket . 
i recommend sticking with the busy bone instead . 
light corn num_extend num_extend oz .   can sweetened condensed num_extend tsp . 
see my reviews for the ther brand .  .  . much better . 
there is also more corn than i like to see . 
just so aggravating that it s not worth it . 
the only good thing about this mouse is that it looks decent . 
no worries i thought and contacted the manufacturer . 
he said the router was fine since the ethernet ports work ok . 
they are so uncomfortable !  like walking on num_extend
don t buy this jawbone era ,  your money is best used elsewhere . 
there was absolutely no help in setting this up to network . 
the usb charger interface was very famous in num_num and early num_extend
the voltages and currents were measured at the same time for accuracy . 
save your money and pick mine up there !  . 
they took an excellent product and cheapen it . 
i bought this a few years ago and replaced it after one year . 
dan quayle is not on record as objecting to it . 
seek out a carbon fiber ,  stainless steel or bamboo version instead . 
to be honest ,  i should have simply purchased a fire steel . 
i bought this for my num_num year old . 
these gloves are thick ,  and the cloth liner is nice . 
i also use it for ,  of course ,  making paninis . 
though the expandable waist factor is a creative idea . 
import the six they offer and it s a veritable zoo . 
unfortunately it doesn t ,  it now sits on a shelf gathering dust . 
i beat it in num_num hours without trying . 
it does diminish the value of the feature somewhat . 
i can t believe this item is manufactured by cuisinart . 
this time around i was disappointed with this product . 
its gameplay hinges on using the stylus for everything except moving . 
that is until yesterday ,  april num_num  oddly enough ,  friday the num_extend
there s no way to turn them on or off . 
great product ,  but dangerous to give your dog rawhide from china . 
my husband says that it makes him sick . 
i might as well have left it in a plastic container . 
i finally opened this extension cord up and tried to use it . 
i hate it but there is no way to publish a one star . 
my mother purchased this pool for my daughter for her birthday . 
but the most recent pack i bought proved completely different . 
this is the worst game in my num_num games that i have . 
made my teenage daughter face break out really bad . 
once it begins to dull ,  you need to throw away . 
weak sauce !  it is almost laughably slow in its deployment . 
the condition of most of the cards was pretty good . 
was very disappointed that the wilson train is so tall . 
leaves residue and makes your hair feel weird . 
the polish is fine ,  the smallest size they make . 
num_num hours later ,  i realized that i had made a huge mistake . 
of course you can chat with your friend but the system is terrible . 
i did not like them at all ,  so they re going back . 
what really made this my top choice ,  is that they are frameless . 
it wasn t the quality of protection as she desired . 
both kids hated them and spit them out . 
hmm the touch screen and controls weren t working . 
had been using this product for a while now . 
too bad the shaft came apart in just about a month . 
these flip flops are very comfy ,  fit perfectly and look great . 
i seem to tolerate this brand of c fairly well . 
i am giving two stars basically for the nice design and reasonable price . 
maybe your kids won t be as hard on it . 
i did find it palatable cut with seltzer and lime . 
i bought this product to watch tv while keeping the volume low . 
in that light ,  i really can t recommend this title . 
now i just keep it aside and using neutrogena from drug store . 
i bought an num_extend and wanted a decent amount of storage . 
red light flashes for a few seconds to minutes then goes out . 
really really foamy and didn t seem to clean well . 
for the right person they might have been good but not for me . 
so i thought these had a lot of sugar per serving num_extend grams  . 
playback with pause and rewind of live tv is great . 
dd received this as a gift at around num_num yr of age . 
it runs terribly ,  and i have a new num_num system . 
it stays tacky so that your polish actually sticks to it . 
it will be only a matter of time before the thin plastic breaks . 
scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine . 
so ,  you can immediately forget keeping dust out . 
i am now on my second one of this brand . 
i ve tried several new and rechargeable batteries and absolutely nothing happens . 
it s not the cabling or anything else in my setup . 
i will never buy it again and would not recommend it . 
with that exception ,  i have no real gripes about the audio . 
this must ve been made by slave labor in china . 
i also enjoy the fluidity of the bowflex . 
if that is their goal ,  they have achieved it . 
you have my money and i have nothing . 
i will try to use it when the time comes . 
for the same reason ,  the item cannot be used as a warmer . 
i tend to use only natural products and always fragrance free . 
the speaker on my cell phone is much louder . 
simply put ,  the key is made out of the weakest expletive . 
i had just got done beating tomb raider and halo num_extend
the tray is the biggest pain when trying to put it on . 
it needs to work better than it does now . 
i tossed the shoes out and never put them on her again . 
i guess you get what you paid for . 
fps view was not as easy to use as real fps shooters . 
it is the same type of flavor but in a liquid form . 
i meant to send it back but i never did . 
the graphics overall don t change ,  only the size . 
again ,  just a sticky mess and no hair removed . 
if it was a little more sturdy it would be perfect . 
i wish we had spent more money and bought quality . 
the dell player also uses this drive and is also experiencing these problems . 
there were several different characters each with their own abilities and such . 
i d not recommend it if you have sensitive skin . 
you d have to pile it on every cracker to have enough . 
something with a bit more of a  thumb switch  would be better . 
it did ship quickly but would not purchase again . 
it tries to be a hybrid of all three . 
i have a golden and he is quite tall for the breed . 
unless you plug in the  optional  power supply . 
it was soooo comfortable for the first two hours . 
sometimes she will come by for a visit on the weekend . 
it s not for me ,  but you might enjoy it . 
several times during attempted construction ,  the model  exploded  into pieces . 
firstly ,  it takes forever to raise your levels . 
every review on here that is a num_num star is right . 
you have to load up a disc to use the card . 
how this terrible design can pass any form of qa is beyond me . 
saw the num_extend and thought they would be a good replacement for the num_extend
prepare to be dissapointed if you buy this game . 
the formula is terrible for anything other than a few quick pictures . 
i purchased this queen size downy mattress num_num months ago from amazon . 
the clips are too small for our pontoon boat rails . 
i would not recommend this one ,  not worth it . 
but this game lacks some of that polish . 
my bedroom alarm clock is louder than this thing . 
i really like how soft and cuddly it is . 
i tried numerous different frequencies and they all had static and distortion . 
something wasn t built up to snuff with this unit imo . 
i m happy with what i find at walmart . 
pictures are very noisy grainy  and colors are inaccurate . 
i m a big victorinox fan and have owned about num_num other models . 
example :  aol num_extend was the version i used on my mac . 
unfortunately all i could taste was licorice and i had to discard mine . 
i ve used a lot of harsh facial cleansers . 
my feet got drier the more i used the  miracle  foot repair . 
i have taken all the kong toys away as he is eating them . 
problem is the design was printed off center . 
it s not going to be very stimulating otherwise . 
these reviews are within a month of owning the product . 
talk about let down this is just a nicer looking halo num_extend
then ,  the seller shipped me a second one . 
this ,  on the other hand ,  offends me on two fronts . 
this sucks a num_extend the icons are weird and not easy to understand . 
and most of the ones i saw were not  amazon verified purchase  . 
i thought i was getting a different product . 
this pot is on the way back to amazon . 
one broke after only a few months of light use . 
for that latter part ,  that s where the fault lies . 
i plopped out into my mouth and chewed . 
it s difficult to fairly evaluate when the product arrives in bad condition . 
i am not even sure if this is real hanes product . 
i bought a more expensive one for about $ and it works perfect . 
it holds atomized gas and makes a bright light . 
can t reiterate enough how difficult it is to use the buttons . 
i did not pay attention on the negative feedbacks of this item . 
they will not match up to holes already drilled in receiver . 
so perhaps it was just a defective batch . 
i ve resorted to spraying lysol on a rag and wiping it down . 
i bought this because i was bored with the others . 
i put the original back in and it worked . 
they were no more effective than the old ones i replaced . 
it was impossible to select any other channels . 
these speakers are very cheap at $ a pair . 
though i hadn t any reaction to it before starting to shave . 
i should have listened to the other reviewers . 
i must agree with many of the other reviewers . 
this product promises much but in my opinion delivers little . 
i had to take this away from my dog . 
you only have num_num spaces in which you can forward ports . 
unfortunately i do not have printer in order to print return label . 
it is important to read the ingredients here . 
the graphics are utterly disappointing ,  and very ,  very static . 
it says on the directions to leave it in for num_num minutes . 
what we got was a game that somehow totally ruined the franchise . 
you cannot get any speed going on it at all . 
so for me this sucked and won t buy it again . 
seal the bag with some air in it . 
flipping out of it ,  my son snapped his neck . 
they are hard as a rock and i think ,  too sharp . 
i bought num_num of these for my kids reading timers . 
was very excited after reading all the great reviews . 
at num_num couldn;t make out holes at all . 
it does mess with your middle ear a bit . 
i had to learn that the hard way . 
it split at the seems and wouldn t stay plugged in . 
a very poor quality fabric ,  was also very short . 
i own the shoes for less than one year . 
one other area in which dom excels was the sound . 
it is exposed metal ,  which over time will corrode and rust . 
it took an enormous amount of dough to make just one house . 
i purchased this when i saw it on the rachel ray show . 
good case but bulky and too tight on the phone . 
i m disappointed by the quality and the smell is unbearable . 
i kept pressing it and then while running ,  it said press num_extend
i can hardly believe this product is from dlink . 
whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude . 
no ,  i am not a scientist but i am literate . 
burns hair and leaves your hair frizzy and hard to manage !  . 
i had much better results with the similar loreal product . 
had i known this ,  i certainly would not have purchased these speakers . 
initial green light would come on but lamp would not come on . 
this may work for prescription drugs but not for supplements . 
shame on you ea for releasing this game . 
if i need more ,  i know where to get my fix . 
it tastes about like an artificially vanilla flavored protein powder mixed in water . 
gil only resembles his tv persona because of his beard . 
however i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer . 
there was no mention in the advertising about the supported speaker weight . 
most of it was broken when it arrived . 
i bought this from petsmart for about eight dollars . 
we carry a shovel to dig a cat hole . 
i suggestecotools bamboo finishing kabuki ,  num_extend pounds  pack of num_extend
quite possibly one of the easiest games i have ever played . 
i may give it another chance as the product itself works really well . 
very nice product but not good for me . 
i couldn t believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend . 
the coding on this remote really was lame . 
reapplied and the seal lasted again and it made it about num_num weeks . 
of course ,  eventually product starts weighing my hair down . 
she didn t even look at it after she had removed the squeaker . 
go with lee filters and get the bigstopper !  . 
who knows how the size difference affects performance . 
it is just very ,  very flimsy and loose . 
just in time for me to get pasted by the opposition . 
i m pretty sure it s heavier than my head . 
i find it outperforms this kitchenaid unit by a long shot . 
otherwise ,  it s super cheap ,  plastic toy which i absolutely hate . 
it fired just a handful of times before it started misfiring . 
it took me a good ten minutes to finally peel off the backing . 
you don t need the strip on the box to light them . 
mints totally fall apart in your mouth after a couple minutes . 
the tines on this item are stiff and uncomfortable . 
on the other hand ,  the biotin shampoo felt very nice . 
the design will cause it to firmly attach . 
switching party members in and out of battle felt like a chore . 
say you just cut a three foot sheet of wrapping paper . 
i just received my dracula num_num game from . 
now i do not wake up to coffee already made ,  big problem . 
as a moisturizer and cuticle softener ,  num_num stars . 
i tried cleaning before applying to no avail . 
the surfactants in here are not good for my skin . 
could not get an edge on my new machete using this . 
it will actually be worth it when it gets to half that . 
these are definitely soft ,  and definitely very comfortable . 
after one use i had to vacuum it all up off the floor . 
my new bottle can t get here soon enough  :   . 
however it seems cheaply made and the felt backing is lumpy and uneven . 
this item is advertised as a speaker and headphone splitter . 
i tried it again and again in so many different ways . 
this is one of the werst games i ve ever played . 
i did not want the ghetto blue look at all . 
august num_extend num_extend just threw away my second brush . 
try another playskool product instead of this one . 
however you it does not work like you would expect . 
the wands come off after very little play . 
the painted name on the bar is barely marred . 
i never put them too loud and never dropped them . 
i tried both cigarette lighters with no success . 
this review was only an assessment of the actual hardware . 
this is frankly the worst game i have ever played . 
tripped the circuit breaker and then wouldn t stop tripping . 
i wanted a product that didn t produce much dust . 
the ip address was also getting changed when i uninstalled cybersitter . 
i m not a heavy phone user nor am i hard on equipment . 
i have used num_num or num_num concentrator cups so far . 
it was still stinging after i washed it off . 
that can t be good for their eyes either . 
got pills in the time frame predicted by shipper . 
skip it ,  and buy a real grinder like a krups . 
the gameplay sucks ,  the voice overs suck ,  create a character sucks . 
i ordered the case and it came pretty quickly so that was nice . 
a game like this cannot be properly played without every . 
this happened within the first couple of hours . 
much wider than num_extend and much longer than num_extend
no matter what i did i had globby brush strokes . 
i bought this for my num_extend boxer mix who is a serious chewer . 
i got no benefit out of this item whatsoever . 
i ordered the ninja sword ,  but i received a ninja machete . 
so i figured the people who were having issues didn t do this . 
they were not very flavorful and very tough . 
this is the first time i ve had a problem with one . 
i haven t seen a single bird even come near the feeder . 
first of all ,  the taco shells were all broken . 
i sorry i wasted my money on this product . 
everything i have loved about final fantasy is gone . 
this burt s bees men s body wash was an unfortunate purchase . 
tha s when i took it into the shop . 
you pretty much get what you paid for . 
the stove will not work wilth small diameter pots . 
the problem with this cream is the smell . 
i do have an issue with the noise canceling microphone . 
it s an extremely simple product ,  and almost all types are flawless . 
i double checked all the connections and it will not function at all . 
he just got back from his dental yesterday . 
it just does not do what is promised . 
on first use this unit heated oil to num_extend
it was only a waste of $ but yes a waste of $
these are not oem ,  they are not stamped blackberry anywhere . 
the light flashed off and on and it didnt get hot . 
i may use it as water gun for my kids . 
please update the picture so we all know what we are getting . 
i unplugged it and let it cool off . 
in fact ,  for me ,  this product was too sweet . 
it may be a nice product and a great price . 
unfortunately ,  all i could taste was the sugar . 
if that s how you roll ,  go for it . 
it is the cheesiest thing i ve ever seen . 
the design is very good with ripples running along the entire handle . 
let me first say ,  i love sim city num_num and num_extend
i built an atm and pay phones and no one even used them . 
that is certainly not the case regarding sony s num_extend
ea is waging war on their customers with spore s activation system . 
it was a lot of work with no results . 
my favourite adventure game though would still have to be full throttle . 
i purchased this electric razor to replace my rotary of num_num years . 
bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus are both probiotics that aid in digestion . 
my phone falls out from time to time so i hardly use it . 
i felt like holding my handgun to the shoulder . 
the remote controller s range is about num_num feet . 
plus ,  th taste of the angel eyes and tylan is terrible . 
so unless you have pretty bad break outs i don t recommend this . 
there is no way that this net fits a num_extend umbrella . 
like another reviewers state ,  all other functions are retained . 
i ve had difficulty using this product in more than one vehicle . 
it does not allow your skin to breath . 
this game has the most dreariest hum tones i ve ever heard . 
i mean ,  yeah ,  it s a ziploc ,  but come on . 
however ,  the steel used for this blade chips very easily . 
easy to break ,  especially after having a couple of martinis . 
i purchased this to use on presta valves . 
i thought this will the same just different size . 
i bought two of these balls and both broke within a day . 
the filter is simple to assemble and maintain . 
i had put something under it so it would tilt forward . 
there has to be something better than this . 
i did not give this product to my kids . 
i use this in place of cornstarch to make deodorant . 
the story lines are realistic and sometimes interesting . 
i don t feel that bad about tossing it . 
this brand does not pass the sink test . 
i think this will take out most num_extend
too bad a great brand turned to crap . 
the belkin worked for num_num days without any problems . 
the napkins randomly come out in chunks of num_num or more . 
the gameplay is fun ,  but too many flaws . 
other than the graphics this game is terrible . 
num_extend size ear phones not something you want to walk around wearing !  . 
would no function with my old ms ergo keyboard  !  sent it back . 
we have purchased two of these toys ,  with very mixed experiences . 
you will find it can get quite annoying . 
not worth the plastic it s made out of . 
yeah i read the instructions ,  apparently the case didn t . 
i have come to expect oxo products to be better . 
this is the third product by this company i have tried . 
this high protein bar by think thin is not an exception . 
it s really creamy .  .  . fake creamy if that makes sense . 
but i am very disappointed with my decision . 
it s not in the faq section ,  that s for sure . 
like i get to the rocky mountains all the time . 
don t waist the money; it s not worth the hassle . 
it s way to big and the pump is to small . 
maybe i just don t enjoy fps s like i used to . 
it will keep your attention for about num_num hours . 
the wilkenson sword blade i used wasn t good for anything . 
needless to say this pump is going back !  . 
unfortunately ,  when he plays with those he stretches them out . 
i m not a fan ,  but i use it . 
the only problem is the he shredded it the whole time . 
overall the graphics just plain lack style or any zest at all . 
i had to buy a charger locally as this one does not work . 
for one thing ,  banana is really hard to artificially reproduce . 
i ve always used the whisper line of airpumps . 
we have since switched to innova evo and have great results . 
not a single dead mole to show for the trouble . 
jabras tend to fit in my ears better . 
the sound quality was not as good as the last one either . 
they didn t do much  covering  of their feces . 
i have to restart the router num_num times per day . 
this apparatus is uncomfortable and kind of yanks on your neck . 
as the other chicken noodle gives me explosive painful diarrhea . 
this does not stay on or help hydrate the cuticle . 
the ages were completely devoid of humanity ,  making the  journey  depressing . 
i was initially pleased with this samsung battery and charging stand . 
there were a good mix of challenges ,  though . 
the panties are a very hard string thong . 
it did not give the results as stated . 
i caved in and gave the frs trial an honest shot . 
it was difficult for me to get it down . 
num_extend the fructose content in the solids is not provided on the label . 
my experience is that it catches more cat litter than cat messes . 
i am so thankful that amazon took them back without any fuss . 
after using it periodically ,  i found i liked it less and less . 
i returned it after the watch band holder broke . 
no moisturizing qualities for my dry skin at all . 
i purchased num_num and all five of them have the same problem . 
it smelled much better than the serum ,  but it did absolutely nothing . 
the roller is convenient and easy to use . 
read about this ,  i still have flakes ,  i have tried everything . 
after one game of that i started over as a quarterback . 
my favorite part of the game is to . 
easy enough to set up but even after draining they grew mold . 
no false alerts occurred during the four weeks since i installed the system . 
my hair is very fine and stick straight . 
i have a roommate who likes it very much however . 
and yes ,  i did try multiple swipers and talked to tech num_extend
whirlpool  kitchenaid parent company  does not sell repair parts for this unit . 
what a hassle because it is so greasy as well . 
next time i will but the twin pack . 
it is still simplistic and does a lot of irrational num_extend
also there are so few in the bag for that amount of money . 
it seems ea will never fix their obvious ai problems . 
its downright shabby in terms of workmanship and quality of finish . 
the story and characters simply were not compelling enough . 
this is my pet peeve with all video games . 
i love oxo products and am still pretty loyal to the brand . 
i have two num_extend num_extend num_num port gigabit switches and one num_extend
 this is further complicated by the low resolution of the psp  . 
i exfoliate my face on a daily basis . 
also ,  the whisk attachment is not very strong . 
i don t even know what i did with this . 
my french bulldog destroyed it in a couple of month . 
i went through almost the whole pack in that time . 
i do not recommend if you use a screen cover . 
the chair is also very hard to clean . 
i have always taken herbs and can tell when something is going on . 
very cool ! what gets me is the replay value of the game . 
some people claim it s the greatest mmorpg ever . 
as i recall it was around three dollars . 
didn t even want to leave the house any more . 
the ultimatrix fit him well ,  the velcro strap being a wonderful feature . 
the green parts are glued on ,  but not very well . 
i thought perhaps there they may have some ideas . 
i have been dying my hair off and on for num_num years . 
this toy was breaking and falling apart as we were trying to assemble . 
this drain board is poorly designed ,  and very flimsy in construction . 
i wear playtex alot so i am dissapointed . 
my puppy does not like it at all . 
not as soft of leather as i hoped . 
that means all the carbs are coming from simple sugars . 
if the version is stated i have not seen it . 
yeah ,  i paid near $ for a tiny amount of glitter . 
i initially chose this router because of its low price . 
it is useless with ice or frozen fruit . 
my first thought on getting this is you get what you pay for . 
going to try the haltie  sp ?   collar or something else . 
i ve been playing triple play baseball since the num_num edition . 
this is cute for decoration but the practicality of it is poor . 
purchased this necklace from the supplier and was pretty disappointed . 
this shell did fit snuggle on my blackberry ,  but had scratchy edges . 
but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan . 
when i opened it ,  the feeder inside was in three pieces . 
it turned out to be red not majenta like was stated . 
so i m moving it up to two stars . 
my regret was i should have waited for the reviews . 
this is not what i was looking for at all . 
it s not even the size of a bic pen . 
i guess i should ve gotten the otterbox from the very beginning . 
it really is the best trimmer i ve ever used . 
i have never even heard of this brand  !  . 
they came to me broken and in really horrible packaging . 
i took several pictures with the item on and off . 
overall ,  i thought the flavor was good but not great . 
this by far is the worst star wars game out there . 
it repeatedly forgets whether i m wearing it or not . 
designed to suck you in but leave you wanting more . 
the last pro deals with the size of the game . 
this rating is not based on the product . 
check out this game at amazon reviews to find out more about it . 
i think i might try the pulling string rotating ones . 
i was pretty excited to try out this product . 
the constant underlying hum is so bad that they are unusable . 
wow !  i actually had to throw these away . 
bought to replace similiar watch that lasted quite awhile . 
i regret buying this because its not a meal replacement bar . 
like joyce sackett ,  i only hand wash them  no dishwasher period  . 
i feel things just don t flow together at all either . 
i was looking for a lantern made in the usa . 
thankfully there is only two in this game . 
game froze every time i entered  create  mode . 
so at first i thought it was worth the money . 
i m so glad i didn t put this on my children . 
there are very few magazines that this will fit . 
and she is kind of cramped in this . 
i sent it back for a refund and initially got a credit . 
and i threw out the pair that i did buy . 
this beats the doors that don t even open . 
ugh ,  the stench !  we never did find the string . 
it does what its supposed to do ,  but not very well . 
this is one of the parts where the game is stupid . 
the many negative reviews here are no coincidence . 
i have upgraded to the latest firmware with no correction . 
i put this in my vcr and it turns off the vcr . 
if you like golf ,  this might be a great game for you . 
they rip again when i remove them from the garbage can . 
i will never have anything like this in my home again . 
we live in hi and my dog swims daily . 
they are so salty and leave a briney aftertaste . 
when your shot in the face ,  your still alive . 
go for a sample if you can track one down before you invest . 
there is a major problem in the design of the spout . 
for example ,  a missle rack has num_extend ammo . 
i discovered this nook tablet has no camera at all . 
it takes ok pictures ,  nothing great but acceptable . 
i ve had the racks for about num_num years . 
i gave this toy away right after buying it . 
however the load times for chrono trigger are unacceptable . 
i have a combination skin ,  but after washing it gets tight . 
i felt better knowing somebody else may like having it . 
do not let it contact your dashboard at all . 
no fantasy draft  you can t make up your own num_extend
the company that makes these toys  alex  have changed their design . 
she told me that i could pray for help . 
only a few concerns right out of the box . 
i guess i have to stick to underwired bras for my workouts . 
so ,  i used the cream for about two months . 
the built in screen protector collects dust and dirt under it . 
have owned a dozen pair of these and they fit perfectly . 
went from opening package to the trash within num_num hours . 
as for the food our dogs like it . 
other temporary tattoos we have had in the past last much longer . 
i would not prefer anyone to buy it . 
to top it off the color is on the orange side . 
this was very uncomfortable and i can t imagine wearing it to exercise . 
remove lid and pour and coffee spills all over . 
i m just not a fan of the original . 
but you always go back for more abuse . 
i have a num_extend hd num_extend television ,  yes it will do num_extend
both are alot more playable and more enjoyable . 
my child liked pushing the button that made the music . 
i don t know what all the raves are for . 
it didn t work for me ,  but it might work for you . 
i won t be buying any more kamik products . 
has had no effect on the ammonia level of the tank . 
these curries are high in saturated fat and sodium . 
so i guess i won t be using this again . 
this one is type num_num and slow as molasses . 
we purchased this vacuum cleaner because it was top rated by consumer reports . 
this is much rougher than the other alum that i had previously used . 
save yourself the aggrevation and buy a $ grinder . 
the  head  on this defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice . 
metallo is featured a lot in the game . 
the beef quality was okay ,  but i didn t like the taste . 
i use it to make homemade eye cream in . 
it now resides comfortably in my trash bin . 
not a huge variety of cards from seller clockwork cornucopia . 
so perhaps this pomegranate beverage was a fluke . 
i used to love it for the bitter taste . 
she did however have some difficulty turning the toy in a different direction . 
i have since gone back koto m more expensive brand . 
i am a vet tech so i am on my feet all day . 
children ,  the elderly or anyone with lung issues should avoid this completely . 
the battles are boring ,  and the graphics are really dated . 
i will not eat this beef jerky ,  it is sickening . 
i ll keep using it just in case it happens eventually though . 
it only faded my screen which i can do by lowering the brightness . 
everyone who saw this remote would  ooh  and  ahh  at it . 
it did nothing for my shedding . all in all useless and overpriced . 
i don t care about the grounds but not on the feeders . 
hopefully my new router from a different company will be better . 
this will not support a heavy amp load . 
maybe more modern games have ruined me for this kind of challenge . 
 :   one of whom is just a teenager . 
the cut can make a huge difference; these look molded ,  not cut . 
i will not purchase this original flavor again . 
it does not stand up well to washing it all . 
but this soap didn t help prevent it ,  either . 
poor show indeed ,  valve and vivendi ,  poor show !  . 
looking at various blogs ,  every site lists glitch after glitch after glitch . 
this one came quickly and in perfect condition . 
this surprised me ,  as other kinnikinnick products are really good . 
topeak normally makes great products ,  but this one is a dud . 
we will drink our case but will not re order . 
i cannot recommend this product at this cost . 
the cinnamon was subtle but i would not pair it with these beans . 
i decided to return my nitrus and take on the mini . 
they get very crispy no matter what temp you cook them on . 
but the thing wouldn t come back on for anything . 
my daughter loved this toy when we bought it . 
the rest of the soundtrack was largely forgettable . 
a quick look inside will tell you why it doesn t toast evenly . 
just use the regular blender blades that come with it . 
the like of different fighting skills is making the game boring . 
works great at first !  but just over a year later . 
well it broke after it ran out of batteries . 
bigger disappointment was how slick the new one is . 
i will keep these headsets for back up s . 
i d recommend that you seriously look at other noise canceling headphones . 
these are the kinds of weapons that you have no chance of avoiding . 
i do like the sponge applicator which makes it easy to apply . 
it came out like fresh blood ,  mixed with water . 
because they don t know the difference i guess . 
overall i would not recommend this version of this glue from my experience . 
furthermore ,  the wireless link doesn t work unless wep security is off . 
and my num_num pound dog is not an aggressive chewer . 
when i first got this ,  i thought this was perfect . 
it always jams and the clip takes forever to wind up . 
these are cheap plastic and it was not what expected . 
i have not had very good luck with these particular ones . 
i feel as though i ve been duped by the kardashian marketing gimmick . 
it doesn t spray as well or hold the pressure very long . 
i ordered this shoe twice from amazon and sent it back :  twice . 
the color is real navy no damage found in this product . 
it is troubling that the product is misrepresented in the picture . 
i am glad i was holding onto him the entire time . 
i replaced the rechargeable battery with a regular aaa battery . 
one of the worst routers ever to buy . 
it said i was getting a wolf size and it was really small . 
why would you do this to the final fantasy series . 
my next camera will not be a nikon !  . 
maybe because i ate cheese with most of them . 
the clutch or coupler broke into a zillion pieces . 
once i poured it ,  it was messy and spilled over the bottle . 
we had this last year and it lasted for less than a month . 
i loved this product for steaming food using little or no oil . 
i scoured the forums and found a suggestion for selsun blue . 
i bought the num_extend abotu num_num months ago . 
we gave up and threw it in the trash . 
except there is a lag after you hit it . 
but for moderate to severe will not be helpful . 
it is made of a fairly squishy rubber . 
i noticed an immediate cooling effect ,  but more on that . 
one for my laptop and one for my wifes . 
these connectors were silver and never fit properly . 
just picked this up yesterday and tried it today . 
i bought these coins for my board games . 
my kids played it for about num_num minutes . 
it takes way to long to build something or to train something . 
i was not the least bit impressed with this product . 
i use almay gel hypoallergenic deodorant  costs less than $ at the drugstore  . 
i bought two titles so far :  this one and nba live num_extend
when it arrived the pistol would not fit the holster . 
the small feels like an extra small ,  cut different . 
i didn t care for the popchips at all . 
i got this thinking that sony always makes quality . 
well then after a cut scene i had to use the move buttons . 
but until they do this is a seriously crippled product . 
but thinking the d lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes . 
and made me start looking at the ingredient list . 
we followed the recommendations on the instructions and everything . 
they are about the same noise factor as my bionaire room airfilter . 
there is also a decent sized hole in the back upper corner . 
i have since purchased three butane heaters that work flawlessly . 
i was happy to find these ,  but disappointed when they arrived . 
you have to order cygolite s rack mount directly from them . 
it works ,  most of the time ,  but it s terribly annoying . 
it now hangs on a wall in my bedroom pretty much useless . 
that s what i am now going to do . 
it makes me kind of sad ,  because the bottle is pretty . 
not fresh and pliable as the first two jars . 
they did not even have any dialog with me before doing num_extend
this one is so heavy and hard to handle . 
i have several that are in a box . 
also ,  the minuscule lcd display is too small to read . 
and now you know which ingredient to avoid . 
i thought the paint was peeling off ,  but it wasn t . 
however ,  this specialty hot sauce was not done right . 
they need to give more for the price . 
please note that both aha and bha can cause temporary skin irritation . 
i ve asked them if i could upgrade to another unit . 
my cats were never interested in this ball . 
and hope !  since we will not be able to return . 
the sleeves were too long and the neckline as sagging . 
bite the bullet and stick with foodsaver brand . 
the shark clip is nothing more than a sling shot for smartphones . 
the quality is no longer there as with previous microsoft products . 
we tried it and it was both very gingery and sugary . 
i used it til the bottle ran out ,  which was quickly lol . 
if you have a strong chewer ,  this is not a good toy . 
i m not satisfied with the product at all . 
the dog ate them but they bothered her stomach . 
dark brown gives you nearly a black head of hair . 
the next pro is the number of weapons was great . 
her favorite is the telephone and computer sounds . 
volume is loud enough to wake the dead ,  even in  quieter  mode . 
which will allow a thicker extended battery to correctly install . 
much better than sot ,  which got old quickly . 
i honestly don t know how this thing even got on the market . 
first off ,  the  strategic  level war of the ring is total crap . 
the first  and last  frying event did not go well . 
it hurt my eyes every time it turned on . 
the case does not look like the picture . 
last year we bought this calendar and this year we bought playmobil calendars . 
the blue one went together easily and no problems . 
but i m going to take it back and try a different brand . 
i suggest not to buy memory cards online . 
the mic doesn t work the volume actually hangs up a call . 
neither cat will touch this food even if mixed with other food . 
a day later she still hadn t eaten it . 
my computer is brand new running windows media xp with service pack num_extend
maybe casio should review the production control at their assembly plant . 
but then any such bag would do that . 
elder scrolls :  oblivion is almost a good game . 
sometimes the buttons don t work and have to be pressed real hard . 
the first section is a horribly awkward length . 
i m used to fresh snap peas that taste like snap peas . 
i will be moving go a new whey powder . 
but hard to complain with the quality of the picture . 
the rest of the minigames are either really boring or just plain corny . 
really not sure why people like this game . 
and having fun is what i want from a game . 
driver num_num is plagued by horrible controls ,  interactivity and sub par graphics . 
the projector wasn t working when i opened it . 
doesn t this seem like these faults should have been addressed ?  . 
the website doesn t even have support pages yet . 
i didn t like it and bought a new one . 
it was too small for me to pull it up over my knee . 
i much prefer the inexpensive gigi home brazilian kit . 
why is it necessary to add so much sugar to this cabbage . 
if so ,  you may like nascar num_extend total team control . 
hollow in the middle ,  super super thick surround . 
this would work for a day or so ,  then no coffee again . 
oddworld ,  blood omen ,  and enclave just to name a few . 
of the num_num cans ,  only num_num arrived undamaged . 
it has sound effects down and everything ,  but the music just stinks . 
i just pitched it and bought a higher end machine . 
it is currently sitting on my counter ,  still holding the sponge . 
we purchased these thinking we d be able to make fried chicken again . 
 interestingly ,  there is no link to post a product image . 
because i wanted items separated during my trip ,  this was a disappointment . 
i d expect a simple usb cable shouldn t last that short time . 
the ammo rattles in the handle but who cares . 
first time out in a windy rain ,  it broke . 
i bought this to pull small logs and brush around our farm . 
no sharp edges sounds like a good idea . 
i have yet to try num_extend at the lan . overall . 
this product isn t much better than a bucket of water . 
the transport mechanism has failed and will not properly load and play tapes . 
this product is clearly marked  made in china  . 
this toy lasted less than num_num minutes and we threw it away . 
it s not worth the effort to open the box . 
pick up some vitamin water or crystal light instead . 
you want a good episode i game ,  try racer . 
i got it as a fun xmas gift for my num_num month old . 
and it was ,  for the few weeks it lasted . 
setting aside those things the game has a lot going for it . 
but the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking . 
forget this game and try resident evil num_num or one of the others . 
so now i am stuck with num_num unopened packages of this stuff . 
really hit and miss with this low dollar amazon stuff . 
seems like the hardware isn t doing the best with android . 
buy your own crackers and hummus ,  and save yourself some money . 
i grew up with the la florentine version . 
it s very important to get her pills on time . 
i am probably going to return this item . 
did some research on line and i am allergic to beeswax . 
can i give it less than one star ?  . 
in retrospect i would not have purchased them . 
not a very stable mounting system for the magnetic pick up . 
i did not notice any side effects as other have noted . 
i couldn t screw it on because the tripod screw was too small . 
all these perfumes are just a recycled version of another perfume . 
i feel sorry for anyone who had to buy it . 
sorry ,  but i won t be buying this one . 
the difference between those and this black kind is addition nutritional value . 
what is this for ?  a training pad protects as well as this . 
just another announcement : basically ,  the num_extend version is not worth purchasing . 
i have noticed a change in this product over the past year . 
there are better water bottle toys out there . 
the container doesn t hold enough water to make the hassle worth num_extend
this product came to me with a broken button . 
or buy final fantasy x that doesn t require a tv . 
the monsters and units are well thought out . 
i couldn t pour it down the drain fast enough . 
this was the weirdest purchase i had ever made with amazon . 
pb is num_extend down on the list of ingredients . 
it is triangular with a big opening in the middle . 
i hate the chemical smell in this product . 
yes that i will give the lastest version of madden . 
if i were straightening it ,  i think it might be good . 
this evidently has a high degree of silicones to produce an artificial shine . 
this specific measurement is no where within the instructions . 
i don t like that i have to wear a bra under it . 
the bad thing is that i found most of it unedible . 
my dog does love her bento balls but i dont for the price . 
actually i returned it because it was so bad . 
i used this to mount folding plastic chairs on my fifth wheel ladder . 
had the same issue with some other walker thin cookies from amazon . 
so we are stuck just using batteries which the systems eat for breakfast . 
it is a plastic snap on so it sometimes pops apart . 
buy another brand or wait for the next generation of recorders . 
personally ,  i would prefer a nice ,  cheap soaking tray . 
after we finish this off ,  i will not buy it again . 
the battery compartment was almost too small for the aaa battery . 
so frustrating and impossible getting this thing to charge . 
then i dried and straightened my bangs like i usually do . 
i wish i would have bought another set . 
i gave some to my bro her who says he loves it . 
this toy was way smaller than i expected . 
then all of a sudden the gas and stomach pain were terrible . 
never worked from straight out of the box . 
for this reason ,  i have not ordered them again . 
i have a couple of num_num rifles for which this was made . 
maybe i m just not putting the right  yummy goodness  inside . 
i had it for a week and it was disgusting . 
games can hold num_extend gigs and are $
you can t even see facial features on people . 
next time i will buy stays with a different attachments . 
i have to press very very hard to make the buttons work . 
i couldn t find anything that made this coffee palatable . 
i purchased one of these a few days ago . 
they are hard to get use to and some what clumsy . 
this product is more of a crumbly cookie . 
it is deceptive that this product uses the word  entree  in the title . 
even my kids with smaller heads said num_extend
quality just keeps getting worse and worse over the years . 
a folded blanket or pillow would be as effective . 
panasonic is off my list ,  i will never buy another pansonic product . 
rice dream has the same effect but adds insulin spikes ,  too . 
even though these are not considered healthy alternatives ,  coke and dr . 
it was very difficult to press the home key also . 
i played soul calibur on num_extend and on xbox . 
it s just a tiny regular sponge ,  kind of rough in texture . 
now i see why it was so cheap . 
i want to put one on the dog and see what happens . 
i had to chop garlic the ninja chopped it up perfectly . 
poorly constructed with thin material on the inside pouches . 
and i only used the product for the application . 
i ordered this product in july and have yet to recieve it . 
the bottom row is such a bad idea ,  it s ridiculous . 
the eboost blend contains num_extend of acai fruit and green tea extract . 
i hated it but maybe you ll like it . 
the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it s gone by bedtime . 
this never dries ,  even weeks later and comes off on everything . 
there s better games to be bought for this price range . 
always buy saucony ,  was trying to go more old school . 
dead or alive volleyball ,  is a pretty weak game . 
we put the new belt on ,  and the belt burnt out instantly . 
i purchased this after reading a few reviews . 
didn t like the fact that it was in plastic either . 
developed ringing in the ears after a bout of cold . 
these feel tight on the ear ,  almost to the point of pinching . 
only few piece real chicken and rest of them by product . 
so you have no means of estimating how much cooking has been completed . 
there s enough pretty graphics to make nice screenshots to sell the game . 
just wait until next christmas to buy this gift . 
repeat until it goes down and stays down . 
they must put a sweetner ,  that causes the explosive bowel movements . 
i thought i would save money by replacing my mbt s with these . 
and it gets boring after the first num_num days you ve played it . 
not to mention the ability to write the disks using the player itself . 
there are scratches on the back of the case . 
it is cheaply made plastic that will wear out after a while . 
luckily i didn t have far to go before i could change it . 
i don t know what the manufacturers were thinking !  . 
they held a zero okay but are completely pathetic . 
i have taken impeccable care of this item . 
this is by far the worst accessory you could put on your ds . 
i even had windows search for an updated driver . 
this price ,  described honestly ,  would have netted num_num stars . 
i lost my $ gamble by buying a case of num_extend
another one of those gadgets that will sit in my drawer . 
why would you want to eat this stuff ?  . 
the only creamy part was the top layer of the jar . 
in their homes and want to share their idiocy with the world . 
quick to deal with just wish it didn t finish breaking on me . 
i did not find the taste to be very appealing . 
definitely did not work and was a waste of money . 
there is no problem using the original ipad usb cable . 
we feed her blue buffalo so she is not on cheap food . 
absolutly do not use the sonicstage num_extend program that comes with this unit . 
i have resorted to using these as target practice with my airsoft guns . 
they have just lost a loyal customer on this change  since about num_extend
after one hour it s effects were gone for me . 
the motors were kind of loud and distracting to the cat . 
i find that i like the old stuff better . 
the waist is adjustable ,  but it runs small . 
she likes everything everyone else said they liked . 
just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough . 
we exchanged it for another exactly like it . 
npc s have sets of speech that actual actors num_extend
 this happened almost every time i stir the tea up a bit .   . 
here are the new ingredients from the bottle . 
it s just that there s not a lot of variety . 
as a result ,  they can t keep you locked in place . 
the first breakage point was plastic down by the charger connection . 
please do not buy if you are using a mac book . 
now it is assembled and sitting in a corner . 
i usually like neutrogena products but this one is a dud . 
i ve had this vacuum for a few years now . 
the directions say to rinse after several hours . 
i bought this to upgrade the hard drive in a lenovo num_extend laptop . 
you might just kick yourself about it later . 
the company failed to provide bolts and hex nuts . 
to start ,  my consol is the num_extend num_extend that plays num_extend games . 
very smooth ,  not much road noise ,  and low rolling resistance . 
now i have to send the lens in for warranty work . 
also ,  kind of pastey when you chew it up . 
it very rapidly pits terribly and scrapes one s face while being applied . 
when you move you can barely see any shadows anywhere . 
for one thing ,  it is definitely not square . 
the package says % shea butter ,  which is clearly a lie . 
i had the voyager num_num for years until i wore it out . 
i really wanted a chrome look but this was legit a sticker . 
went to check why and the front screw was stripped out . 
halo is one brand that do these quite well among others . 
 the only thing plugged in and operating in the garage  . 
after reading the reviews i thought i d try these curry noodles . 
over all the num_extend is a much ,  much better game . 
well than god it s dirt cheap cos this product is terrible . 
the silver colored ones seem to be much better . 
instead ,  she dips it into one of the dispensing bottles . 
i have to hold the knife further back on the handle . 
i did expect to get more quality and use out of these speakers . 
the second hose arrived on august num_extend num_extend
we can t trust it keeping meat for more than num_num days . 
i didn t see any benefit to this product . 
this made the mother so upset ,  she couldn t do anything . 
why ?  because the database function won t work otherwise . 
if you are dealing with a flat body part ,  i . e . 
this game had an interesting premise but it failed to capitalize on it . 
this does not hold up to a real working photographer s usage . 
the remaining num_num are colorings ,  vitamins ,  minerals ,  and wheat starch . 
second one quit working less than a week . 
can t understand how they can get away with calling this natural . 
in the raglan tee shirt it was huge . 
in this case ,  less would have been more . 
i dont hate anything but cauliflower and snakes so . 
i would have liked to know this before i bought it . 
lighter color issues aside i do like the pattern . 
at around $ bucks ,  they seemed to be an ok deal . 
it has a large environment ,  decent graphics and decent gameplay . 
really confused why they wasted their time and energy making this one . 
so after comparing boxes we finally went with the littermaid elite mega . 
it also can t charge batteries individually which my rayovac charger can . 
this is some pretty chunky coconut and i don t care for it . 
do not buy this with the intent on starting a fire . 
felt it could be a little more sturdy . 
it s a bit bitter ,  and the raspberry is tart tasting . 
i could only get it down by adding some sweetener to it . 
this powder is more like translucent powder rather than a base . 
the big pleco sucks algae of the glass ,  mabe he bumped it . 
i encourage people considering this product to google this product for information . 
the plastic does not work well with the touch screen . 
but with the very lightweight handle the balance felt completely off . 
and the glue was terrible so they came right off from the sticks . 
we purchased the princess num_extend for our girls for christmas . 
it looks like a piece of pink glow bracelet . 
tricky to do and ended cracking the volume dial . 
moved on to angel eyes which works great . 
the tiny spatula that came with it was virtually useless . 
it makes my nail polish matte ,  not shine . 
it s not the worst but it sure wasn t the best . 
works . update : this cord fried the motherboard on the pc . 
so beware folks ,  ,  ,  this makes them useless for me . 
disappointed in good grips first time a product from them didn t work . 
the pedals were shipped quickly so i had nothing to complain about . 
i thought this product would be perfect ,  what a disappointment . 
this meter seemed more than num_num degrees off when making maple syrup . 
i don t see it having the legs that halo had . 
the game is rather fun ,  but i have to warn you . 
if you are thinking about this tyr ,  don t . 
i would have given the first case num_num stars . 
the jambox blew it out of the water . 
i expected thai kitchens sauce to be similar ,  but it s not . 
and the actual net weight of the arms is more than num_num lbs . 
i would not order this product or anything from this company . 
i wear a lot of dangle and hoop earrings . 
they could have done a better job with it . 
if i can give this zero stars i would . 
this game has all the makings of a very bad game . 
i felt better the day after and decided to try it again . 
ladies and gentlemen ,  i have some terrible news . 
i love the taste of these bars ,  it s fantastic . 
doesn t even come close to fitting on anything . 
this grinder is a great example of  you get what you pay for  . 
lee riders used to be the best and most comfortable . 
most of them are hand guns ,  sniper rifles and single shot pistols . 
i did better just cleaning off my glass and saving my money . 
all these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds . 
going back to a brand i know works . 
i am suspecting that the item that i got is an old batch . 
i read reviews where folks had great success . 
he got it for christmas at six months old . 
assembly :  i asked my num_num year old daughter to assemble the units . 
it has stayed at % charging for more than num_num hours . 
i bought these collars as advised by my vet . 
this stuff made my hair tangled and dry looking . 
i was very impressed with the quality of the paints . 
i got this for my daughters long ,  thick ,  dry hair . 
this soap made me break out in a rash everywhere i used it . 
changing dvds at the unit is maddening ,  too . 
also the orange plastic piece that snaps on the handle persistently comes off . 
do not buy this headset ,  buy an overear one . 
but the styrofoam inside the plastic top keep getting moldly . 
so basically you pay $ for a pair of sunglasses . 
we were very unhappy upon receiving this item . 
once the screen was installed ,  the quality was horrible . 
then ,  you have to pour tiny cups into the lid . 
i m going to give that one a whirl . 
like i said ,  i ll do more research before ordering another bottle . 
didn t work for minolta pagepro num_extend updated firmware ,  etc . 
i could not have been so far from the truth . 
very disappointed that this item was shipped to me . 
 it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth ,   one teen said . 
you can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create . 
it has left red sunburn type burn in areas where applied . 
it does not leave my skin feeling fresh and clean . 
i ate sunbuter on two slices of gluten free bread . 
furhter this is supposed to be one of their more established products . 
i am no stranger to pacific foods or soup products in general . 
the phone is great ,  as usually for htc phones . 
would be a nice bra if it did fit correctly . 
i used it for a week and it gave my face a rash . 
i have started going to a medical spa to buy all my products . 
right now ,  tho ,  he still tries to bite my fingers off . 
my cat still meows like crazy and urinated everywhere he s neutured  . 
seems to be out of tune and no way to adjust it . 
i read a bunch of good reviews on this filter . 
would not buy again ,  but not worth the trouble to return . 
tried it in three different vehicles to confirm that it doesn t work . 
the outside of the outside slot toasts a lot less than the insides . 
i m happy we didn t save it to be a gift . 
i was terribly disappointed in them and with amazon s poor packaging . 
it will charge my tablet ,  but not my phone . 
ten percent i would go to % etc . 
the box arrived with scratches on it and the plastic is dirty . 
i found it to be a boring kiddie game . 
also ,  they do not fully cover the screen  poor cut  . 
i have a pug and a beagle pup . 
he never explained why ,  and he never talked about it before . 
my suggestion is to buy rechargeable batteries from any other company than microsoft . 
as a result it picks up odor  and taste  of previous contents . 
i have ordered another cobra ,  and returned the whistler . 
the rear sight is weak ,  front sight fell off . 
so sad because they are so darn cute !  . 
i used this when i was staying with a friend for the summer . 
frankly ,  one sip was more than i could bear . 
does anyone know a better product i can use ?  . 
look for things that really work stop wasting your money on this stuff . 
these sterling silver purple gem earrings are cheaply designed . 
the bialetti from amazon has to be a complete knock off . 
i got this because it seemed like it would fit my lifestyle . 
i returned this item because the reception did not improve . 
i don t know how women can sleep with the on . 
got dooped by the reviews on how they d fit . 
it just plain reeks overall . graphics csound dgameplay dlasting appeal f . 
cost more to return than it is worth ,  so . 
the pin its missing makes it completely worthless for my needs . 
it really should be advertized and just a nice underwire bra . 
it will go out for a garage sale . 
theoretically ,  this seems great to sanitize the toothbrush . 
so ,  i bought this based on a review . 
i switched brands first to purvana and got shiner ,  thicker hair . 
the characters and environments look blocky and lack any detail . 
wrong battery sent ,  couldn t return it came from china . 
or ,  if you like the very natural look . 
it is together and i have recycled the box . 
the plastic by the wheels on all num_num bags is breaking off . 
i got two of these which worked fine for one year . 
i think it is junk and replaced it after num_num months . 
you have to try to clear the screen of all pokemon . 
unplugged  which is a struggle in and of itself . 
this might work for others , but not for me . 
i was trying to save some money and give this a shot . 
i was able to use it twice to apply blush . 
i recently purchased num_num similar champion shirts at costco and loved them . 
i have had a few of the metal ones and i love them . 
but it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much . 
i received an email alerting me of a  lost cat in my area  . 
since then my review got associated with a different product . 
this thermometer worked just great for num_num months . 
the second problem was the first slicing guide tab snapping off . 
i just ate a hershey bar and now the original taste is gone . 
bought the size all my shoes are these are too small . 
i was thinking that most of it was natural . 
with all the great reviews ,  i didn t even save the packaging . 
i don t think i ll be buying this again . 
i ll be looking for an alternative to this brand . 
its not different then the battery that comes with the phone ,  . 
i guess i got what i payed for because it was very cheap . 
upon examining the olympus ,  i suspected that its  weatherproofness  was pretty weak . 
the kids got into a dual and the plastic broke on the sword . 
not that this matters ,  because both are inaccurate . 
i saw another reviewer say that their machine broke in num_num months . 
as almost every other reviewer has stated ,  this thing runs hot . 
bought another one in a different color and it seems fine . 
so i decided to go with the frownies this time . 
i felt the loud static would damage my ears . 
but unfortunately ,  i found little that i liked in the meal . 
your madden game of num_num is the same as the num_num edition . 
since it cannot be returned ,  i just tossed $ out the window . 
i used the paddle option for a cc @ belt line . 
very disappointing; i will be sticking with the  other  brand on amazon . 
i would rate it zero stars ,  but there is no such option . 
it was not bad looking and i was excited . 
she had the rash for months and would complain about her stomache hurting . 
i kept the bottle unopened until i felt a cold coming on . 
life is too short to waste playing bad shooters !  . 
did not match the grey shoes so i returned them . 
i do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car . 
too bad ,  as these would probably help me . 
the stated diameter of this tea ball is two inches . 
she is not amused . the monkey makes one sound only :  screeeeech . 
i suggest that a person buy a vulcanizing patch kit instead . 
i was so excited to get this mower for my son . 
the total cost of the earphones was around $ after shipping  great deal  . 
it protected my screen from people just walking behind me in the office . 
i was really excited to see dark hot chocolate and ordered a box . 
no frills ,  but everything works better without any headaches . 
i am trying a new brand now ,  but trust me . 
baiting it can be confusing and could cause anelectrical short . 
it died while on vacation and never accepted a charge back up . 
the other num_num percent is water glycerin and alcohol . 
they don t like getting their food out of it . 
hmmm . on a personal note ,  i love most things japanese . 
one time i was run off the road and the truck was stuck . 
poorly manufactured and fell off the wall within the hour of hanging . 
 i have a legit version of it that has a pleasant smell  . 
on the top it says maxell in big letters . 
it ll sound like my fone is breaking up . 
unless i have stupid sugar ants ,  this is not attracting them . 
considering motorola s reputation ,  this product needs to be withdrawn and repackaged . 
my result using this was not very good . 
the upside is that this is very affordable to try . 
mine has already found it s way to the garbage can . 
my hair was fantastically curly because of this conditioner . 
they seem to be made really well and look great . 
and i try not to use chemicals where i don t have to . 
they used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers . 
same problem here folks ,  memory card error frustration . 
my feet were practically sticking out of the tent . 
when i first tried it on ,  the shirt fit fine . 
the washer did the trick and the slipperiness went away . 
therefore making the num_extend wind noise cancellation useless . 
we played fetch with this twice and it was pulled apart . 
they are mechanics who know how to use a laptop . 
doesn t increase the shine or cleanliness of my counters . 
it was the toe thong; pinchy and stiff . 
the motor started smoking and then it leaked . 
which has the same resolution as this camera . 
not the same number  mine num_extend but still seagate num_num gig drives . 
perhaps it helped me  focus  a bit more but thats it . 
i have a combination skin with oily tzone . 
yep ,  just like the more expensive blocks ,  it is pot . 
say goodbye to that . black monday is flat out terrible . 
i simply cannot understand how this grooming product stays in production . 
the scope is very difficult to look through due to the small diameter . 
num_extend so i wasn t happy about the shorter muir glen shelf life . 
afte a few months ,  half of these have lost several led elements . 
in theory it should follow the contours of your face really well . 
first time i have every seen this happen in the oven . 
i should have read those last num_num words more carefully . 
i do not recommend for people who constantly use their wireless internet . 
i don t know if its refurbished or perhaps really old . 
when i received this product it was the wrong product . 
i thought it tasted like a weight loss shake . 
you have the traditional meats and cheeses and veggies . 
this is not a game to really explore . 
the first taste i noticed was a sour bite . 
within two days i had birds trying to carry the tape off . 
i gave her a taste ,  not even close to eating . 
when completed i was left with flat hair . 
needs to be much thicker and hole larger . 
i had to push it down repeatedly while scrubbing . 
the gear had no way to remain stable as it turned . 
almost entirely the opposite of what the num_extend game was . 
costs too much to return ,  sits in the corner . 
i loved the velvety fur look from adventures . 
even our dog wouldn t eat them and he eats just about everything . 
the white part has chipped and his extremely filthy looking . 
this game is a big disappointment from nintendo . 
he said it needs to be at num_extend to have a shot . 
seems to me there sting wax would be no different . 
i would have wanted more for my money . 
to be fair ,  it is advertised as being heavily insulated . 
total waste of money . sending back and hoping for a refund . 
the cat dancer and  da bird  are much more appreciated by my kitties . 
i ve ordered a few of these in different sizes . 
i wasn t too fond of this cereal in any way . 
they knew this and released it to the consumer anyway . 
this was the first day i used the reel . 
right now ,  all it has it the white packaging box . 
i did a quick  google  and neutrogena products came up . 
i have verizon wireless in the washington d . c . 
tried for num_num days ,  including a long back num_extend
but the game it self totally had no substance . 
i hate this dryer because of this issue . 
this belt might be worth $ but not the $ it cost . 
since tho i have purchased the nylon bag carriers . 
i wanted to like this game , really i did . 
but ,  i would never buy this or recommend it . 
you ll end up with basically the same thing for a lot less . 
it absorbs well and doesn t have any scent ,  which i liked . 
the gameplay is boring and not at all intriging . 
and if they can go outside ,  let them catch mice . 
after each charge the battery in my unit got weaker and weaker . 
i opened it and tried to get it to stop . 
guess what ?  started making noise after two weeks . 
the basic premise of the game is a blast . 
i have really thin nails that chip and peel all the time . 
however ,  googling finds many other people having similar problems . 
save your money because this is dollar store quality junk !  . 
very disappointed ,  esp since this small item is so expensive !   :   . 
i had to increase my volume just to be heard . 
i haven t found a replacement i like yet . 
i had to buy a whole new set to replace this one . 
these aren t mints ,  so they dissolve almost instantly in your mouth . 
you need to take extra pancreatin or other enzymes for that . 
i am not sure how the other reviewers don t mention this . 
didn t work ,  but perhaps my skin simply needs a benz . 
i didnt take the case off and on either . 
so i have been through two sets of these now  shame on me  . 
after reading the reviews and searching ,  i bought a eureka num_extend handheld . 
there are still other creatures ,  but i love the old ones . 
no charge was held by any of the batteries . 
plus ,  your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you . 
i stared blankly at the screen as it crashed over and over again . 
this thing weighs a lot for an electric trimmer . 
i purchased this based on the high review ratings on amazon . 
well ,  i m going to continue with this  out of desperation  . 
this product enhanced the dryness to an unbelievable level . 
i will stick with my hg ,  the powder mineral power foundation . 
i ordered this for my boss for a christmas present . 
i have drier hands this winter than i ever have before . 
the game is extremely difficult and is dull and lacks excitement . 
the hype is unwarranted in my humble opinion . 
the first time i washed it the teddy bear fell off . 
there is no online mode in the final product . 
i m selling mine on ebay and planning on buying a canon num_extend
bought this and the redness relief night cream . 
the flavors  olive oil ?   are fighting each other . 
sounded lovely for the first hour ,  that s why two stars . 
mega man num_extend continues the mega man x series slide into ruin . 
i kept the num_extend one around just for better coverage . 
i got a black screen when trying to go on to disk num_extend
i thought the material would be a bit thicker and totally different . 
i have plantar fasciitis ,  and these did not work for me . 
i gave this away and found a nice closed handle one on ebay . 
now i am certainly glad i purchased these . 
you really can get a better kerastase product for this money . 
it doenst move around to keep her engaged ,  just back and forth . 
i was told it was just as good as the fender case . 
i followed directions exactly and these were plain butt awful . 
i plan to repeat this treatment a few more times just in case . 
there s an interactive ai who resembles a major pop star . 
i threw it away after reading all the ingredients . 
this obviously did not hold up very well . 
it is cool to wreck that slow ,  poorly designed car . 
then each part began to get holes and deflate . 
barry also finds a survivor ,  who is named lucia . 
not really much positive feedback i have for this product . 
the gasket that does not fit is not made by oster . 
highlighting my dark red hair led to fluorescent orange . 
not enough support so i never use it . 
the death star did not include the necessary light bulbs in the packaging . 
i will not buy them for my son again . 
pass on this one ,  you won t regret it . 
this one does not stay on my lenses properly . 
i did not like them and they were not comfortable . 
this shoe was a bis disappointment to me . 
i am back to using my num_num year old radio . 
finding puzzles locations can become ridiculously difficult to locate . 
it smells great but tastes like flavored water . 
they get really uncomfortable to wear after about num_num minutes . 
so usually my daughter is dragging the dog around on its back . 
i bought this to charge my usb bluetooth device in my car . 
no one cared ,  because i had dropped it . 
you can just roll and hit the triangle button all game long really . 
basically as you attack an enemy ,  you increase the chain gauge . 
they ve tried to simulate an otterbox ,  but missed . 
thinking it was just a fluke ,  i bought an identical one . 
i also notice it smells like shampoo and ingredients say sulfates . 
those shoes have a much better insole ,  and the shoe breathes well . 
i should have done a little homework before i ordered this . 
although battlefront is really fun which is available on num_extend and xbox . 
i didn t like it ,  although i m sure some will . 
she was just as hyper as always inside the house . 
this product ,  starbucks via ,  is a starbucks product . 
i ve read other reviews regarding this particular slow cooker . 
i bought it august num_num and promptly moved abroad until num_num months ago . 
kaileena gives this game the edge it needs . 
i think something must have happened when they were being made and folded . 
they messed up how the mall should be made . 
it was only included headset and wall charger . 
there are many good looking mobs and places to explore . 
good idea ,  but they used the wrong material for it . 
but ,  it did not give me enough lift . 
i really thought it was just another boring race game . 
i wouldn t recommend it unless your cat responds to catnip . 
sometimes a higher price doesn t equate to higher quality . 
i got it and used it and just didnt like it . 
our previous glasses  name brand unknown  never had issues like this . 
it came cracked straight down the ear through the forehead . 
while the coffee tastes great  much better than my old mr . 
everything i wanted from my hair is here again . 
they did not explain how to lock the door . 
sometimes it will give you a creepy feel because of it . 
need i say more ?  good idea but not well executed . 
powder at the bottom and large mostly whole pieces at the top . 
the kong sitting frog squeaker lasted about num_num min . 
after wearing it ,  he smelled like sweet cooking spice . 
i tried this hair lotion out but it was just awful . 
the screen never works and its awalys freezing . 
it looks good ,  but what good is that ?  . 
its pretty bulky and weighs about half as much as my bike . 
the net that arrived was the very thin one . 
seems okay to me but i will not buy accessories online anymore . 
he spit it out when i gave it to him . 
this product will ease stomach distress for most people . 
i would give this a zero if i could . 
look at the rating label on each device to confirm . 
i would rate this as a no stars ,  do not buy . 
at least not from what it says on the label . 
it is approved for internal and external use . 
it is cheaply made and my small dog made short work of it . 
at any rate ,  they are not to be found ,  it seems . 
honestly ,  i don t know why i strayed from my usual mascara . 
best feature :  the strap adjustments are on the front . 
i have always been somewhat to very satisfied with my purchases here . 
my hair felt stripped liked i shampooed it again . 
get this game on a console instead of a hand held . 
i put in num_num new batteries and turned it on . 
otherwise it is a great musical gift for babys and toddlers . 
i have the same problem list the other user . 
save yourself $ and buy the cheap ones . 
by closely supervising the kids ,  parents give lessons on safety . 
i have had it for num_num weeks now and have used both screens . 
the flash light is what gets me the most . 
looks like it was made for another kind of tablet . 
dump both water and blue cover in sink . 
two of the sound cables did not work at all . 
it has boiled all of the liquids out of all three meals . 
i have had these headphones for about num_num years now . 
we had this on our dog num_num times . 
used on a hunting trip for num_num days . 
looks like it could fit a kids head better . 
like most games the difficulty level is absolutely ridiculous . 
this is just a small and expensive bottle of chlorine . 
don t like the way this product feels on my skin . 
she chewed right through it and chewed me . 
i cant even describe how soft this brush really is . 
i wouldn t buy this again nor order from this seller . 
the company will refund but you have to pay shipping charges to return . 
the jury is still out on whether  sorbitol  is bad for your health . 
the color was the only nice thing about it . 
one of the very few disappointing purchases from amazon . 
blue buffalo  a very good quality food  absolutely did not agree with her . 
they slide all over the place during play . 
this is some of the worst stuff i ve ever tried to drink . 
color wasnt right for my skintone shades too light . 
the pockets close by zipping down instead of zipping up . 
however ,  it is way to noisy even at the lowest setting . 
at the same time ,  i noticed no reduction in stress . 
hopefully i just got a mistaken shipment ,  but i was certainly disappointed . 
this radio is not rugged or reliable enough for emergency use . 
i decided to take my chances and get it for my daughter . 
i m happy although lens zoom is pretty tight . 
we couldn t get the hang of shooting this pig . 
i got this product because many people seemed to like it . 
i did not notice any results from this product . 
i bought this to use on our first winter camping trip nov . 
you just hook it up ,  turn on and wait for results . 
i bought this from xump . com ,  an amazon seller . 
you also had to buy clothes before you were allowed to see them . 
i was afraid to give it to my parrot . 
like it but back plastic cover is easy to break . 
it just didn t fit like it was suppose to . 
overall i m not impressed at all with this filter . 
about num_num hours later ,  the thing was completely shredded . 
i wasn t rough with this at all or using it improperly . 
i will never recommend this to any one . 
it still works ,  but the annoying sound isn t worth it . 
i actually had to throw them away and i hate wasting anything . 
although a lot of people liked this game i hated it . 
the connector to the phone came apart in that time . 
it s flimsy and gets really tangled really easy . 
the kids did have fun with them while it lasted . 
nothing compared to the enemies in the first two prime games . 
i ll put my money into true compression socks instead . 
i am scheduled for another dexa in num_extend
steer clear of this item and this seller !  . 
the insoles would keep slipping inside the shoe . 
this was a very difficult screen to put on . 
great range and the usm provides quite and fast auto focus . 
tastes great and is affordable on a budget . 
i checked and don t see a recall notice for them . 
also it comes with a temporary tattoo so kids will like that . 
i would not purchase again or recommend it . 
also ,  this camera is not as well made as prior models . 
i normally find them in the cake decorating aisle . 
it has lots of bugs and drives me crazy . 
i m glad i was home when it happened . 
he is currently ripping up the rest and chewing on the skeleton . 
i would not recommend this filter based on my experience . 
it did not taste like tomato and basil . 
as just stated the cross over and spin moves are too wide . 
i remember the brita filter from num_num years ago and this isnt it . 
it makes you think ,  are they that desperate ?  . 
i do not recommend this product at all . 
this cheapist form of magnesium can cause very painful gas . 
how the game manage to warrant m rating still puzzles me . 
i received an engine hoist leveler . i understand mistakes happen . 
oh and when mine came the cheap plastic lid was broken . 
the first one i unwrapped didn t work out of the box . 
but do not look for the documents to go feature . 
the cushion feels great at first ,  but turns to mush rapidly . 
my shipment arrived with a lot of the plastic bottles dented up . 
i have num_num speakers hooked to it and it is great . 
at least it was only $ that i wasted . 
thanks to amazon prime i had it in num_num days . 
i would have rated it higher but this is bait and switch tactic . 
so if you want to spent $ on this vs . 
waste of money buy from a different buyer . 
this currently resides unused in my junk drawer . 
i would rather have my ass jiggle in my cheap yoga pants . 
it smells like chemicals and not good at all . 
i m online right now looking for another one . 
i blamed it on the dvd s them self . 
tool broke the first time i tried to use it . 
buy the good stuff like optimum nutrition ,  etc . 
we bought num_num of these and sent both back . 
with normal use ,  the optical scope immediatly broke . 
i try to read the reviews more carefully !  . 
first ,  it does not really look like the wand from the movie . 
i tried the electric nose clippers but they were uncomfortable to use . 
no antibiotcs ,  no pesticide residue from gmo food and no antibiotics . 
and second my nail polish was very chalky and cakey . 
another weak spot was the lack of ammunition . 
it did manage to work for nearly num_num hours . 
i do not get the chance to  wear  these out . 
the other one split ,  but stayed in position . 
all in all a real piece of dung . 
nowhere did it say that when i bought it . 
it serves no other purpose than creating a nice look to the product . 
i added it because i thought it was convenient . 
and to me ,  that s not the mark of a good sauce . 
the actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment . 
i tried changing batteries but nothing seemed to work . 
i even  optimistically  took a  before  picture ,  hoping i could show results . 
i suffer from gastritis and this product caused me pain . 
go with any of the other titles that came out after this . 
that is the fact that it does not pour properly . 
the taste is not so great either unless you like chalk . 
once a program crashes ,  it requires another num_num minutes of work . 
do not buy this if you are expecting a full sized medicine ball . 
i used it about ten times with three different recipes . 
but the design for my size is too small and low cut . 
they are persistent ! i was hoping this would work . 
it didn t keep me up for more than num_num minutes . 
maybe if u dont fold it back up it will last longer . 
they live for their treats and are not especially picky about treats . 
my only problem was the charger they included . 
so sad too ,  it is just so adorable . 
and the fake gems dont look that stylish . 
i paid num_num dollars ,  might as well finish it type of game . 
but their products have begun to really get mediocre . 
this battery dies a lot quicker then my rechargeable . 
i cant even play a football game because its madden or madden . 
i would not recommend purchasing this deep fryer . 
too bad it s too late to return it . 
it was an electrical problem with the switch . 
i experienced some burn ,  and some itch for a day . 
on my old peeler it s pointed ,  and works much better . 
it felt a little like a teflon coating . 
it is really only useful for small amounts ,  even though it is num_extend
i must be an anomaly because i just could not drink this . 
then i restarted the computer and that drive never came back . 
maybe if you have short hair this might work better . 
but just like so many commercials it is very far from reality . 
order up ,  way up ,  in your cup for this particular bra . 
normally spigen sgp makes the best screen protectors for phones and tablets . 
i thought this would be a great game . 
like it could fall apart at any second . 
i don t understand why there are so many positive reviews . 
it is too loose ,  and therefore is not very protective . 
the smell actually keeps me from using it . 
let me know and i will look them up for you exactly . 
off to find a better sheet for the future that will last longer . 
well ,  i already tried that before ,  and it made no difference . 
what i got was a very flimsy plastic . 
unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations . 
i m also not sure if i should be eating something s ovaries . 
so you have to remove the power tip each time . 
like twine ,  thats the best idea ea came up with . 
obviously razor has a defective part that needs a redesign . 
we ordered num_num but one is unopened as a backup . 
i like the fact that this folds up into a compact design . 
i bought this for my home due to difficulties with allergies . 
might be good for a hard carrier that has no padding . 
just like that num_num years old can t wait . 
sorry for the misinformation; i don t usually watch their programs . 
apple engineered the buttons on your phone to feel and activate just right . 
this is the first simmons scope i have ever ordered . 
i have no idea why anyone would think that s a good idea . 
also ,  i really dislike the scrubby chunks in the soap . 
so this might have some effect on the fragrance . 
i laugh when people write that paperboy is a very difficult game . 
you can t enter most bulidings but grand theft auto claimed you could . 
which is also inconsistent in it s placing of many  sets  . 
not sure what to do with them now . 
i m not at all pleased with this product . 
while the pomade itself is okay ,  i didn t like the scent . 
once again you don t get what you don t pay for . 
this is not worth the money ,  it is going in the garbage . 
the speaker cutout is better than my second choice ,  but not by num_extend
morrowind should only be played by fanatic ,  hardcore rpg players . 
it gets very hot ,  and will scorch your wood and carpet floors . 
i get even more excited when it is a  tactical  game . 
if you set in on the console ,  it ends up sliding off . 
the problem is that it went and lost itself . 
i just wish that i knew what that product was . 
where to do rambo where to do use flanking . 
i am thrilled with the difference as is my cat . 
the aqueon version has never leaked and is clearly better made . 
also the top was a little tight for me . 
even jumping over a fence you can get caught on the air . 
so this is not a good cable for ipad . 
charged my iphone num_extend num_num percent with the case fuly charged . 
i rubbed my finger across it ,  and my skin was stained black . 
had to exchange for large office and omni directional antenna . 
i had hoped the other reviews were wrong ,  but the weren t . 
ok at $ to $ not a penny more . 
i would like a pair without any issues . 
the taste doesn t last and it just ends up smelling gross . 
needless to say ,  i am returning the machine . 
how hard is it to cut these precisely ?  . 
i have a degree in computer science from u . c . 
didn t want to but i had no choice . 
the blender is so loud it scares our pets into hiding . 
i ordered num_num of these batteries to go with my droid x . 
the packaging was surprisingly difficult to open and then reseal ,  too . 
anyway ,  i returned this one immediately !  do not recommend !  . 
not with a bang ,  but with a whimper . 
turns out this one was a lot larger . 
and the smell is awful to top it . 
i worried about him choking on the plastic parts . 
the finish was scratched already from the factory and would rust quickly . 
sadly ,  it exhibits this behavior on all bikes . 
they taste fine ,  maybe even better than you d expect . 
so this case will fit well ,  and it is soft inside . 
i suppose you get what you pay for . 
so i wasn t even able to use this unit . 
it did not have enough force to dislodge wax . 
sizing is completely off  too large  and the cotton is coarse and uncomfortable . 
if you have similar num_extend the cord is too short . 
moreover ,  they are too small to provide any moisturizing benefit . 
i would not recommend this for any person or any sports . 
at this rate ,  it ll be gone in a few days . 
this game was independently produced by two gentlemen . 
if at all possible ,  download and install those before you install the num_extend
for me ,  these shoes were not good at all . 
impossible to clean ,  you remove the top ,  everything comes apart . 
they don t react to it like they do to other cat treats . 
real citricidal gse is fantastic and i rave about it all the time . 
would never have bought any other product if the quality remained . 
i purchased this game when it first came out . 
the kibble would be stale before they could finish it . 
i should not have to purchase parts separately . 
the birds like them and they re generally easy to keep clean . 
will not purchase this specific item ever again . 
let me tell you the good points num_extend
so save yourself time and money and get a cst tire . 
don t know if there is an inexpensive meat grinder worth having . 
especially when you live near water ways or the coast . 
i purchased this bra in anticipation of surgery and boy was i disappointed . 
either these bras are sized wrong or they re just oddly shaped . 
too bad ,  cant find european cosmetic in usa . 
at first i didn t make the connection to the food . 
ended up getting a name brand to replace it . 
healthwyze . org check it out and make your own decisions . 
no sound clarity ,  customers said i sounded like was in a box . 
probably could have super glued it together before use . 
it only goes up ,  not up and down . 
years ago this had concentrated scrubbers in it but now does not . 
a smaller one i bought i have no doubt is pig skin . 
this fruit punch is more punch than fruit . 
each cartridge has only num_num games with only num_num challenge levels . 
i tried several different configs ,  even different mice ,  with no success . 
i am still irregular and hope the progesterone will help . 
grill function is incredibly irritating when you want to slow cook . 
this is a pretty good wood block set . 
when it sits at the angle it is noticeably flaring outwards . 
the others move forward as many spaces as they have cards . 
i checked the box to see if it were lemon ,  no . 
if there is a xxl i don t think it will work out . 
customer service sent me a replacement and i returned the defective charger . 
it always flamed up if baking the salmon fish . 
as it stands now ,  it just earns two stars from me . 
i really don t care how slim a phone is . 
the  high  setting is a low consumption  again imo  . 
i received a different product ,  similar but not what i wanted . 
if you don t remove it often ,  it s a great buy . 
but since the inner bottle was undamaged i kept it . 
i checked it with a multimeter and sure enough it was doa . 
i got bored of it in just a few months . 
got him a different brand which cooled his mac better . 
i d play wir if i had a copy  over this any day .

a hopeful replacement for gummy bears and juju beads . 
surprise .  .  . there is a invisible wall blocking your way . 
i now have quite a few miles on the pedometer . 
even the frosting drizzle is not enough for them to eat these . 
it is an inferior game packaged in the duel monsters wrapper . 
as someone who travels for work i have found this to be indispensable . 
i bought the sony for it s size ,  and for num_extend quality . 
this stuck to every inch of my crust . 
the rack itself in its cardboard box weighs exactly num_num lbs . 
you would be better off getting a pricier one . 
what a terrible precedent to set in the pc software world . 
it appears the flash drive is dead with tons of imformation on it . 
i expected a screen that would prevent prying eyes from trolling my screen . 
i was really disappointed in the amount of tea leaves in each bag . 
the jewels are also enormous and don t look very good . 
samples of all cat foods should be available for the many fussy eaters . 
i have tried tons of glosses ,  from dior to maybelline . 
these strips have something in them that makes my whole body itch . 
i do not believe they are from hanes or fruit of the loom . 
i bought this shirt and i haven t wore it at all . 
the real deal ,  $ in my local dept store . 
i returned it and got my money back . 
i don t really care much for this product . 
there is just no comparison to the classic game . 
this remote does do it s job ,  but there are many faults . 
you need strong durable plastic for a tougue cleaner not this crap . 
not sure what went wrong with this version . 
for me this one is not good quality . 
they usually are not needed and put into a bucket . 
the grafics arn`t the best but they are ok . 
but i would not ,  could not ,  eat this again . 
take my advice and pass on this one; it s a loser . 
here is how it went . another num_num hour download . 
did not match the story you watched unfold in my opinion . 
like others have said ,  one works when it wants too . 
i wasn t injured ,  but all three of us could have been . 
this is the second one that has broken . 
spend a few bucks more and get something better . 
we  hubby and i  lincoln logs as a kid . 
it gave a sour scent on my skin . 
at that point i called kimber ,  the distributor for meprolight . 
as far as they re concerned ,  the game isn t defective . 
i will be taking the beriner turner slicer to goodwill now . 
not too mention they make the course look silly . 
the probe burned out after only one use . 
it worked for a few times at first . 
it tastes terrible ,  and smells an awful lot like cow poop . 
this is the num_extend silicone skin i ordered . 
i need boots i can wear indoor and outside in all weather . 
why ?  they smell more than any other sandal i ve worn . 
i looked at the container of milk which was fresh . 
i just don t care for this at all . 
and it leaks every time i pour tea . 
the things that giggle at you are annoying but pretty easy to kill . 
you have to press the button for each change in minute or hour . 
num_num years later !  still had good suction though . 
or you would experience a bag of bananas . 
in our volvo it s right next to the hood release lever . 
purchased new but this was dead on arrival . 
worked great for a couple of months after that . 
this was purchased as a birthday present for an num_num year old . 
pete flavor to be very heavy and oddly syrupy sweet . 
this concept sounded great to me ,  but i can t use it . 
i have a medium sized female cat and a larger male . 
i took two sips of this tea and shivered from the horrible taste . 
we used this for about a year and it s alright . 
the snap to lock sides of the case were nonexistent . 
i did not buy these but did two other spenco inserts . 
when i made this soup it turned into watery potato flake gruel . 
as a previous reviewer said ,  they do smell awful . 
i didn t like how this game looked cartoony . 
so even in the right size this is not the bra for me . 
bought this for my num_extend dog thinking it would be nice for her . 
especially since newman s own is such a great brand . 
i always give it a good shake before each use to avoid clogs . 
after using two tubes worth ,  i still noticed nothing . 
additionally ,  there were odd orange specks on the inside of the bottle . 
but that s to be expected ,  they re fun and taste great . 
he really doesn t like it either so he runs away . 
it does not hold my hair that well . 
num_extend the cant angle outward is severe and not adjustable . 
not worth the risk of ruining other ingredients . 
my daughter saw this in the store and begged to get it . 
a cardinal sized bird shy away from it . 
the carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category . 
they re no where near as comfy as my num_extend pair . 
label says it s safe for the earth  that is very vague . 
however after trying this for a few days i gave up . 
i will be ordering different ones to replace these . 
i will use it up ,  it may well be very healthy . 
the missions rely on an endless supply of respawning enemy . 
i thought maybe i d get used to this one but no . 
my last otterbox commuter purchase was old stock ,  too . 
parents ,  don t even consider buying this for your five year old . 
unfortunately ,  these aren t acceptable even for light use . 
the large breeze pellets are disliked by most cats . 
i m not really sure which pair i got . 
so num_num stars for not being complete liars . 
didnt like it at all ,  made my skin red with a rash . 
the purple one that i am using has held up much better . 
i really don t want him on adhd medication . 
the tilt is too overpiced for how it  does not  perform . 
i ordered a num_extend and it was too small . 
if so ,  it wasn t a video that he d bought . 
my biggest problem with this game are the levels . 
it used to last much longer ,  and the color was better . 
amazon remains my favored place for internet purchases  . 
you may also find many of ourproducts at thomson direct s web site . 
everyone keeps saying it s amazing and is the best zelda ever . 
i m stuck somewhere i can t get out of .

i really love kettle brand chips ,  but these are rather disappointing . 
i switched to purisonic and i m much happier . 
i have psoriasis ,  with a few spots on my scalp . 
yup ,  welcome to the world of digital technology . 
not worth the fifteen dollars i spent on them . 
even though the action is intense throughout ,  the gameplay becomes really tedious . 
the  coolmax fabric shell  is just cheap cloth sewn over cardboard . 
these generation num_num minis have a cool concept . 
first ,  the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily ,  num_extend
i had meant to  and thought i did order  the juniors l . 
the only thing nice bout this is the bottle . 
i had it outside one summer and it faded pretty quickly . 
i loved this item when i first purchased it . 
once enrolled ,  you create a totally new pet . 
it works well for that  still noisy ,  tho  . 
i bought num_num of this spf ,  and am returning num_num of them . 
not good if you have rambunctious kitties like mine . 
these did not work for me ,  but i had to try them . 
i returned it the same day it arrived . 
can not be healthy . this product made my skin worst . 
i have recently moved to grill stones that work a lots better . 
i returned after the first day of having it . 
evidently something inside the watch went bad and drained the battery . 
i really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face . 
hard to see through after awhile ,  maybe that s why you get num_extend
the only thing i could say about it is that it looks nice . 
it worked well for about num_num months then only intermittently . 
all in all ,  i m extremely happy with this headset . 
there is way way too much backtracking in this game . 
the only thing it lightened was my wallet . 
i read about this game in game informer and it sounded interesting . 
once a fish hits these they begin to fall apart . 
they slip off their head and are so cheap . 
it seems like something is mixed in it and it smells different . 
there is an odd taste to items i have baked . 
and amaranth in flakes from their brother s cereals . 
i posted a pic showing the reflection caused by this filter . 
from then till now it has worked sporatically ,  but mostly stayed on . 
i tried to use it again ,  and it would not work . 
this game isn t as good as silent hill three . 
locally the jars are clear and the product is snow white . 
do yourself a favor and get an inch waste size belt . 
get something slightly more expensive and thank yourself later . 
it may not stand up well to weather . 
it s never elaborate like in wind waker or skyward sword . 
grandma bought this for my boys  ages num_num and num_extend
i like the size of this product for game meat processing . 
i tried going down a size but didn t help . 
recognizes ,  my motorola xprt and then it doesn t . 
the lid is too high and very inconvenient to store . 
the presto cool daddy num_num model uses rectangular filters ,  not these . 
expensive and ineffective ,  ill stick with thermafuse or davines products . 
this means that each port will get at max num_num milliamps . 
accidentally dropped this ,  about num_num feet ,  and the clip broke off . 
avoid this product until someone competent hacks it to make it act properly . 
when i placed it in my cart ,  it was $
tried to use it to whale watch in alaska while on a cruise . 
quiet sweaty and hard to stay in place . 
then the material covering the top of my thumb began to rip . 
i haven t decided if i am going to use it or not . 
there is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink . 
buy what you d like but i m sticking with wd . 
you would think it would work the same but it doesn t . 
i will try microshift s bar end shifters next time . 
a stairway gate should be very sturdy and should require installation . 
i ve only taken it off about num_num or num_num times . 
its agonizingly loud as it spins the cd and cleaning heads . 
even different from the photo on the product box . 
this was pretty cheap ,  so i got what i paid for . 
i returned the first one for a replacement . 
the position of the legs make it impossible to dress and play with . 
moreover ,  i question how for how long these strips will be available . 
think maybe one or two car washes or a month max . 
it dulls extremely quickly and is very poor quality . 
it feels more like polyester to me ,  not like a natural fabric . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
kind of liked the funky color combo too . 
it lack features for a product that costs this much . 
it was very frustrating so i to return it . 
he looked at it like it something strange in it . 
a couple of months ago i purchased a bottle of c . o . 
the levels and their titles weren t all that spectacular . 
it s like trying to detail with someone s pony tail . 
it artificial sweeter is ok with you ,  right on . 
they also make a strange sound when airplanes fly overhead . 
simply put ,  did not work on my tablet . 
it seems like the whole ui is speaking foreign language to me . 
its a pain in the butt to get a good spark . 
a similar material but scarf like would be better . 
this worked the first time we plugged it in . 
the image dries to quickly when trying to put it on your nails . 
fighting games are one of my favorite genres . 
on a more positive note ,  i was fasting once feeling quite hungry . 
it doesn t fit over my screen protecter very well . 
this retinol cream did nothing for my combination skin . 
you are much much better off getting lacewings . 
and in a jug like this the liquid pours out too freely  messy  . 
i couldn t get this to work with my bose system . 
facebook is easier to read by using the ie browser on this phone . 
i deleted the review thinking i was guaranteed my product in good condition . 
and amazon both were nice about it and took it back . 
i ve had mine for about a year and a half . 
i will update this if flaw is corrected . 
just like the first one did :  it just quit working . 
this is an otherwise fine keyboard ,  but it s going back too . 
you re better off buying a more expensive one . 
you can hardly hear the voice in it . 
as a grown man i cannot see myself playing this . 
i tried applying it to something and the smell was way too weak . 
but the unit i got was partnered with the wrong adapter . 
my eggs were extra large ,  so i reduced the amount of water . 
it looks like a like a wet rag just hanging there . 
but beware !  the handle can and will severely pinch your skin . 
i now buy popcorn in bags from the health food store . 
we have num_num or num_num of these by different prices . 
i hate to say this is even a toy . 
why i even try other products is beyond me . 
a pumice stone will often work on rust deposits . 
it did seem to give me a bit of a headache . 
i purchased a num_num mg in a different brand which worked wonderfully . 
i wanted so much to like the tea . 
ended up giving it away as a present . 
i have never had a problem with any usb enclosure . 
might work for some but did nothing for me . 
i dont see the point in this remake . 
as for recommending or not recommending this product . 
waste of money ,  and the worst purchase i ever made on amazon . 
spent a lot of money and now the filters are useless to me . 
the item itself is very flimsy like other users have stated . 
the binder seems very cheap ,  the paper inside looks faded . 
i really do ,  but this one just fell short for me . 
i looked at measurements and most rolling bags are really large . 
they taste terrible and are very hard to eat . 
i attempted to use it on a viewsonic gtablet . 
very dissapointing because this stuff is not cheap . 
everything sticks to this pan ,  even when the pan is greased . 
the shirt doesn t hold its shape and the wrinkling is terrible . 
this is a danger to anybody who uses it with high loads . 
however children that are used to chocolate milk may not like it . 
box got delivered today ,  i could smell the garlic from another room . 
i agree with some of them ,  but for the wrong reasons . 
i had to check the box to make sure . 
gorgeous fragrance for some num_num seconds ,  zero staying power . 
when you go to sleep it s speed num_num automatically . 
sudafed does ,  but i d rather take something more natural . 
num_extend has been the best basketball developers since the dreamcast sports games . 
until microsoft automatically upgraded my machine to service pack num_extend
its very soft and durable but is for an iphone not the touch . 
i ve had the num_extend usb drive for less than a year . 
the two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight . bottom line . 
first time i charged it would only charged to %
having windows xp i just tried to load the driver . 
hd tvs are completely unforgiving to these types of games . 
i am the person that reads every review before purchasing an item . 
just dont be dumb and jump from num_num to % like i did . 
sometimes the red box goes away on its own . 
so it is a bit strong . the effects on hair are debatable . 
it s no better than a cheap bra from a discount store . 
i bought this salad spinner to replace a broken salad spinner . 
it also has two items that are the reason you heard of it . 
i tried to fix it but it was impossible . 
i picked up the device ,  and she ran off and stopped barking . 
i wanted a turntable to play my dylan vinyl collection on . 
canon want s $ just to look and see if anything is wrong . 
the camera died while properly stored in its case with the batteries removed . 
they also slip when put on top of the cards . 
the fabric is very pretty though and the shoulder straps are comfy enough . 
but consdiering the price .  .  . i got what i paid for . 
i bought this for the  anza borrego  desert . 
this basket employs the typical deceitful work of a master basket maker . 
the novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer . 
the two slots on the right side are merely passable . 
as this ages those attachments will be more prone to breaking . 
its to to loose like i said they gave . 
the  blinken light  came on when turned on . 
new balance has a lemon with their num_extend at least in my size num_extend
i was surprised at how flimsy it was . 
i wanted a thermal design at an reasonable price . 
the true cost is quite high based on the actual dosage required . 
one swat and the mouse was ripped apart . 
this dog water bottle is not very convenient at all . 
i attempted to sway them with my logic ,  but i was unsuccessful . 
did not do anything for my breathing  !  . 
they got issues ,  and i don t see them fixing them . 
there are only num_extend ounces of tea in num_num tea bags . 
i have better things to do with my time . 
i think it would make my skin too oily . 
but i bought the same package at gfs foods for three bucks !  . 
fix the car before doing a brand new paint job . 
my girls had been talking about this toy forever . 
when i m putting this stuff on ,  my bifocals are off . 
you have to push the pages to hard for them to say anything . 
with the skin on it ,  you cannot put it in the holster . 
i don t use the spatula very often now . 
ridiculous !  i wouldn t buy these shoes for $ much less $
i use baby oil to remove waterproof mascara; petroleum jelly will work too . 
he has a back door hole another num_num feet away . 
slidin  the slopes  series num_extend  japanese :  a slope num_extend
this is not a final fantasy in my book and it just uninteresting . 
if you have guitars like seagulls or so ,  definitely avoid this string . 
i like these seeds ,  but then i like my teeth too . 
there are much better products available in the same category in this market . 
it is obvious this was not checked or fitted before shipment . 
the other reason was for my own dog . 
this cube just clunks over and they lose interest . 
i don t know if it s me or the product . 
i did have concerns about the knob due to past reviews . 
but i ll take functional and comfortable over looks . 
twice i have had these batteries leak in a electronic atomic clocks . 
so far my dog isn t interested in this toy at all . 
this made my hair so dry and hard to manage . 
one or the other keeps slipping forward or backward or downward . 
the cups ,  on the other hand ,  run big . 
only thing that helped was putting my dog on antiinflammatory prescription meds . 
that s not a whole lot of fun for the kitties . 
my brother took iron and starting bleeding through his urine . 
i bought this pitcher thinking it was a super bargain . 
it looks really nice but next time i ll buy elsewhere . 
i bought this for my daughter and ordered the size she normally wears . 
i was hoping there would be more images of the main characters . 
i am certain they would be amused and shocked and finally outraged . 
maybe it was just a bad batch or maybe keen changed the design . 
it feels really cool and moist on the scalp . 
this shampoo doesnt make my hair feel strong . 
strap adjustment system was apparently designed by rube goldberg . 
also ,  the price was great at only $ at the time . 
back they went ,  thank goodness amazon pays for return shipping . 
too bad ,  because i would have ordered more in future . 
we opted for the chef s choice num_num glass model . 
this can result in some seriously twisted knees and ankles . 
i first treated all my drains with lye . 
the main compartment can barely hold the digital elph . 
well ,  this game ain t nothin but a num_extend version of smackdown num_extend
sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews . 
it comes off in a few hours in patches . 
my walkman doesn t . however ,  my walkman picks up stations . 
without the attachment i can t mount the mirror . 
many times ,  enemies will sometimes shrug off direct hits . 
the mic and volume controls do not work . 
i remember when jill s freind shoots off the zombie s head . 
most of the voice acting is second rate at best . 
however with it being so dull ,  it hardly compares . 
first i will say what i like about it . 
i will try wearing it with the boot extender tomorrow and post . 
purchase an like item and was sent a subsitute . 
i received it mar num_extend tamrac bag is a big improvement . 
i really hated this game for many reasons . 
expected this to work a lot better than it did . 
it actually is worse than our old one . 
i know some will think what do i expect for the price . 
i tried them on three different walls in different rooms and same result . 
this might be the worst shaving product i have ever used . 
don t purchase this if you care about your hair . 
this product arrived not sealed in any way . 
i always like tresemme  products but this misadventure cured me forever . 
preheating ,  hey ,  i thought this was a thermal carafe . 
ive used this product like num_num times maybe ,  and the wire broke . 
i have a cd with some very long songs . 
i am returning to amazon for a refund . 
i bought this for my num_num year old grandson for his birthday . 
the cotter pin was also extremely difficult operate . 
i tried all three ,  i used the utmost precision and care . 
i thought this was gonna be great but no effects . 
the cable and the car charger works well . 
i noticed absolutely no difference using this diffuser . 
i ll pipe my spritz until i get a new press . 
most cans of foam do not fit inside the base . 
it is difficult to uncoil it or to stretch it out . 
i suggest you order at least one size larger than your usual . 
do yourself a favor and order a better cable . 
why ?  while they are pretty ,  these are very lightweight and fragile . 
sorry ,  but there was nothing i liked about this product . 
how much is a long life and good health worth to you . 
when i saw the words brownie crunch i had to try this bar . 
one of the num_num buttons was very hard to turn on . 
its interface is very nice . documentation is pretty poor . 
the first time worn they developed a major hole and run . 
save your money and buy a more reliable unit from another company . 
this is the most ridiculous sized child s toy i have ever purchased . 
i picked this up right before christmas on sale . 
so my boyfriend and i are pretty snobby about our games . 
coconut water with a splash of guava as a below average product . 
not at all what i expected and i usually like skechers products . 
when we inflated the rainbow ,  it looked so cool . 
you are basically paying money for an extremely flawed and one sided license . 
running windows xp ,  i could not get the software to work properly . 
i had quality control issues on my last citizen . 
i returned it promptly and bought him a different knife . 
the htc evo num_extend is stated to require a num_num amp charger . 
what the label doesn t say is that the product is mostly water . 
ubisoft won t help ,  and their website is useless . 
there is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware . 
we spent num_num hours at lake michigan on a sunny day . 
they might fit a little kid comfortably ,  but not an adult . 
its like a regular skin nothing special about it . 
noise or not i am sticking with the old ones . 
i enjoy amazing grass products so i purchased this . 
but ,  now ,  there is no way i would trade them . 
has a taste and consistency that just didn t work for our family . 
i did both of them exactly by the instructions provided . 
these filters have no discernable impact on odor . 
you can crash into buildings ,  cars ,  cop cars ,  motorcycle gangs . 
there is honey in it ?  didn t taste that either . 
i ve bought num_num different ones made by this company . 
after testing and checking the connections ,  still no difference . 
it has cartoony graphics  a wii staple  and the controls are intuitive . 
this is when i decided to  refill  the set . 
i purchased a few of these because of the reviews . 
tried to use this to inject juices into a ham . 
replacement parts are available . bad :  it makes a huge mess . 
and you won t regret a penny you ve spent . 
this was very distracting and pretty much ruined any picture . 
unfortunately nothing works unless the track is in the predesigned order . 
it s a plastic watch that never turns off . 
the sickening sweet aftertaste led me to read the listing of  other  ingredients . 
my son told me to play the other game  mvp baseball num_extend
we are using it in conjunction with the neem shampoo . 
this is a very oily and greasy product . 
out of the box ,  it is too bright . 
showed it took % then when used the next morning it was empty . 
i loved this when i first bought it . 
the dark brown is a very thin possibly plush material . 
wish i read the reviews on this site first . 
there is a propellant as with any aerosol can . 
will last long enough to get you excited then break on you . 
enough said to fill up the word requirement . 
but something about it will make em run . 
seriously ,  this is simply not a good product in my estimation . 
i haven t been this disappointed in a game for a long time . 
going to try to get new batteries and whatnot today . 
it s really flimsy and the construction and welding is very low quality . 
be careful with products that contain this artificial product . 
needless to say i won t be purchasing these again . 
i used it once and haven t touched it since . 
the product needs to be worked on after you get it . 
i returned it today and will continue to stick with my chi . 
what more do i need to say ?  tastes nasty . 
this is my second iphone and num_extend time putting a screen protector on . 
i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing . 
the lights came on but i didnt have anything plugged in . 
my dog went nuts when the box arrived with the beneful inside . 
to bad as i like the color red . 
that one had just been supporting the lcdmonitor and not moved at all . 
i ve been using it for several months with no problems . 
if i had to do over again i d pass it on by . 
there are too many things that are problematic . 
i love curry and surprisingly ,  this was not that interesting . 
if you buy this stove ,  please stick with coleman fuel . 
it started to freak out all by itself . 
if you have to stand for long periods ,  forget it . 
the outer  layer  had barely begun to break down in that time . 
my children received this item as a gift for christmas . 
the page said nothing about these shoes being seconds . 
these work fine as remote speakers when listening to music . 
the producers apparently couldn t differentiate between needless waiting and stealth . 
i no longer feel comfortable buying nutro for my beloved felines . 
i guess this is a case of getting what you pay for . 
i sure wouldn t want num_num prongs sticking in my neck shocking me . 
num_extend this is my first review of any product on amzn . 
continues to drop like crazy even with latest firmware from linksys . 
i highly recommend trying out avodart if you can . 
i want strong ,  money spending development from beginning to end . 
affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay . 
i am not even sure they can hear it when they are barking . 
when i first bought my num_extend i got num_extend num_extend and num_extend
i called the manufacturer and the rep was extremely helpful . 
bought this toy for num_num month old who loves playing in the water . 
this machine has a very bad design for the belts . 
i was trying to cut sugar to lose some weight . 
other than that this is a very cheap holster case . 
if you have a sony handycam ,  you know the drill . 
there are far better models out there for only a few more bucks . 
the sound is too poor of quality for thirty . 
this fancy little dodge is more of an insult than anything . 
these edges also block the mic and other ports . 
this cuff just cant discern the proper reading . 
so whats instore for the game over the next num_num monoths . 
i have purchased the expensive meaty variety and the aspic type . 
i bought a case like this before and it worked fine . 
small ,  plastic ,  lightweight ,  not a quality product at all . 
i could eat those by themselves as a snack and absolutely loved them . 
its very dull and doesn t have much taste at all . 
oh ,  and slippy is more homosexual than ever before . 
as with all melissa and doug toys ,  they are made in china . 
this product looks so good but tastes so awful . 
the next flaw in the cart is the baby seat . 
i first bought this for num_num bucks at a local large retail store . 
my car charger would not charge both my iphone and my blackberry . 
basketry is loose and constructed of tired ,  very thin straw . 
and don t accept a  should work  answer either . 
safe enough to shoot an enemy at the other end of the corridor . 
leaves uneven line of unsealed glass all around . 
it might work for some people but it really hurts my eyes . 
it is new product development gone horribly awry . 
the build quality is superb and it handles perfectly . 
time that it would work got shorter and shorter . 
it lasted two days ,  and then died again . 
i replaced it with a dell jukebox and am very satisfied . 
i bought this in the buff color and the touch of toffee . 
compared to the num_extend this thing is unflyable . 
not good in a noisy car for example . 
i can honestly say that it didn t reduce the shedding . 
and we tend not to take pictures in rapid succession once we start . 
i bought tthis item to replace my belkin ups that died . 
hell ,  i just love the orient logo in general . 
for me ,  it barely lasted half a day . 
the rest of the space widthwise is wasted space . 
i had this product for num_num months and liked its performance . 
i spent way too much extra time cleaning it . 
i keep my chopping blade in my processor . 
not sure if this is due to the weak seam or weak material . 
not really any learning or skill in it at all . 
another series of dog deaths from treats from china has been released . 
if you hand the camera to someone to take a picture . 
i needed the extra cable but this one was not what i expected . 
this line left my hair soft and manageable . 
the packaging says best by jun num_num num_num but something is definitely wrong . 
it did make an exact replica but for me . 
i didn t lose any fish but my bangaii cardinals were swimming weird . 
very thin ,  does not hold in your hair . 
take a heavy pan with tall ,  but not too tall sides . 
my kitten can pop it off in less then num_num microseconds . 
now he uses it as a paperweight on his desk . 
maybe amazon isn t the best place to get parts . 
i would go with a chelated magnesium glycinate or magnesium malate product . 
i specially bought this item to increase sex level . 
if im not the first person to open it im not interested . 
the keyboard set up does not work more than half the time . 
i do like the color i just wish it wasn t so streaky . 
cute colors but too tight around the thighs . 
no reason ,  at this cost ,  them mechanism should  freeze  . 
however ,  this product doesn t seem to be making a difference . 
i don t understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser . 
kellogg does not use gmos in these countries . 
i wanted something soft for her first  baby  . 
why do they move so slowly ?  i couldn t stand it . 
they are so damn tight that they hurt . 
really miss the old quality made opener ,  very dissapointed . 
i don t know if i would recommend it to someone else . 
hope i remember to try it again then and update my review . 
i ll definitely pass your feedback on to our product development team . 
this procuct has a lot of sorbitol in it . 
just not the same in terms of the flavour . 
ea s days are numbered they just don t know it yet . 
i have used both faithfully ,  exactly as stated in the directions . 
the blend of oils in this stuff is amazing . 
all of the things they show you are not very easy to do . 
then it became really sticky and decided to leave residue on my phone . 
i got this as a gift for my girlfriend who is into tea . 
it is not what is pictured or described . 
very annoying as i had to pay return shipping costs . 
no way my small dog could get through these treats . 
i ll probably drill holes in it and attach it with screws . 
once they start to chip ,  the chip even more easily . 
just like they say you get what you pay for . 
this game ruins hands ,  and sleepy little brothers . 
i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome . 
the holster does not hold my husbands phone . 
i ended up losing a lot of hair during the detangling process . 
webbing and other materials are cheaper ,  thinner ,  stiffer . 
i received the item as ordered and it never worked . 
too weak for a motorcycle and my phone would drop . 
only gave it a star because it does work . 
it didn t remove my makeup very well either . 
i have been fighting sinus and flem in chest . 
just be careful when pouring . msr has a better idea . 
can t use on tub surround only original tiles . 
i love the appearance of the watch and the price was very affordable . 
i wouldn t recommend this for a newborn as the box suggests . 
there is no flashing light visible while wearing the num_extend
i bought a much cheaper airstone that really delivered the goods . 
well let me tell you how cheap this case is . 
bar and amazon s price of $ is outrageous . 
i wound up ordering an electric can opener . 
only one pair is remotely comfortable out of the box . 
to me they had no flavor and were no fun to eat . 
plenty of room to run around ,  but not much out there . 
they might as well have been the pointed ones which i already have . 
i do not recommend this to newbies of the series . 
up until this point it has been fairly true . 
thus effectively it is worthless except for ipads  not iphones  on widows computers . 
so you might end up with a cooked mass of unmixed ingredients . 
one even tried to eat a chewed off piece . 
the old model had an adjustable flow and was totally silent . 
it is a very frustrating doll for her to play with . 
i finally had a machine shop weld it on the gas tube . 
i did this to make sure that i hadn t missed any triggers . 
i do like the depth and size of it otherwise . 
these are too small ,  a weird cut ,  definitely irregular . 
so ,  they sent me the cheaper one when i ordered the num_extend
i can t believe a cap could put me in so much pain . 
i have to send it on my dime to them for repairs . 
it worked on num_extend and xp ,  on laptops and pcs . 
original hitachi magic wands are made in japan . 
it hasn t yet using sll four for more than a week . 
i should ve read the reviews and measurements more closely . 
wished i could just get the cable as the ac plug works fine . 
also the story lines are different in those two versions . 
i thought a bone fragment may puncture her gi system . 
spend a couple dollars more for a better pair . 
i completely missed that these have a mat finish . 
it is too distracting and does not fit on the helmet . 
regardless ,  this tea is really not very good . 
the middle part of the pedals are made of plastic . 
that s not gonna happen !  i m not paying for the inconvenience . 
i recently had to replace one of these under warranty . 
don t bother this battery and will not hold a charge . 
however ,  the product is not good for my skin . 
it just felt too rough on my scalp and hair . 
guess i will be saving these for anyone else that needs them . 
there are healthier alternatives out there and these are by no means inexpensive . 
does not make sense economically ,  even if you like instant coffee . 
currently two of the cups have cracks again . 
neither were as good as any cookies my grannies made  :   . 
the frameless blades don t work at all on rear window wipers . 
title pretty much sums up how i feel about it . 
i tried this flavor because it was the cheapest of the bunch . 
they really do a great job in that department . 
the color is consistent with the photo ,  however . 
i gave it num_num stars because it looks nice . 
the graphics were nice ,  but the game wasn t fun . 
i would give this one a miss and rent it . 
i have been the same size num_extend for my husband for years . 
not a fake as far as i could tell . 
amazon is still the number one by far for my purchasing preference . 
i think this part must have been written by their corporate lawyer . 
basically ,  the quality of the abby cadabby wand is good . 
other than the yucky color ,  these pencils are terrific . 
the ammunition clips chamber just like the real thing . 
i wanted to switch to natural products so i tried burt s bees . 
i bought this to go with my new powerbook . 
i chose an inexpensive model and i received a poor product . 
charging the phone with the outside shell is very difficult . 
the black labeling over black siding makes them even more difficult to see . 
my cats showed little interest in this laser but love chasing actual lasers . 
the second ,  third and fourth led s lit up . 
i bought this in early july and was very excited . 
i had to order a rail and ringswill slide on . 
ordered several different brands of screen protectors to use the best one . 
i emailed hasbro but never got a response . 
the change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure . 
this product did not work for me in the least . 
not too loud ,  the magnet and the stand works . 
the package even states that these are num_num pastel balloons . 
he has a doggie squeak toy he likes . 
you can not control which direction it num_extend
always feeling like it was going to fall off . 
cheaper drug store brands seem better to me than this . 
the outer jacket is loose from them innercore . 
these patches remind me of pieces of envelope paper with glue on them . 
so i looked on amazon and ordered three boxes of these . 
the plastic bag it all came in was broken on delivery and useless . 
i was eager to use the new pan for a thanksgiving dessert . 
i tried cleaning before applying to no avail . 
it s works but honestly you don t need it . 
i have since gone back to designer skin products . 
dried out my hair ,  did not leave it straight . 
gems fell of withing the first few hours ,  corners broke quickly . 
you cannot count on the chinese for similar behavior . 
most console gamers probably wouldn t enjoy a game like this ,  anyway . 
only two magnets plus lots of sticker which don t stay on well . 
all it does is click and spit out butane . 
the board itself is nice to look at and well made . 
its no wonder that they give you num_num screen protectors . 
i don t know why and i can t fix it . 
they make it to the top of the loop and splat . 
shoes were still about a half size too small . 
goopy and yucky ,  never buying waterproof anything again . 
this product is very thick and has a much frothier taste . 
there was no reason for it to do this . 
the rotti killed this toy within num_num weeks . 
if you work on plastic watches and sub num_num watches . 
my num_num year old had a lot of fun putting the airplane together . 
also ,  i found the colors ran to the light side . 
the one thing i will say is it s well made  wood  . 
met all requirements ,  but it just wouldn t work . 
on the left lower corner of the lcd screen it showed num_extend
the stitching on the velcro loop was coming undone . 
it gets confusing to know what to buy ! i regret this purchase . 
this product was totally worthless in my experience . 
if you want to order online try a size smaller . 
fell apart before i even got it on the phone . 
i had the case for about a week and threw it away . 
my num_num lasted almost a year ,  not quite though . 
terrible smell ,  like tea tree and oranges zest . 
did one more test in controlled lighting to get the same results . 
it s no surprise ,  pokemon games never look fantastic graphically . 
it just didn t feel like a ff game to me . 
i been using this for a bit and havent seen much results . 
that s just too much work for a $ toy . 
i have to pump ,  pump ,  and pump to taste any salt . 
in fact ,  imho ,  num_num degree scrolling should become a standard . 
the pan is not secured to the pole well either . 
with roadway safety in mind ,  this isn t a trivial matter . 
i don t remember reading the description past num_num unique colors . 
the point of a ipod is to listen to music . 
this dye will get into your eye when you are washing it off . 
the main section of the vacuum has great suction . 
unpluging then repluging the unit in would get the sound back . 
it will take about num_num minutes to thoroughly melt the broken crayon num_extend
by the next day they had refunded my money . 
jane s wwii fighters for example ,  was a wwii combat flight sim . 
so i will keep this inexpensive cord as yet another charging option . 
i tasted it and couldn t see what the big deal was . 
i don t get it ,  but buyer beware on this one . 
you don t know who you are in the game . 
and i hope that you will evaluate this transaction positively .   yeah . 
so far i have thrown away about one third of the briefs . 
i have four of their batteries and two chargers . 
try getting broken english speaking customer service people to understand the problem . 
i m glad i got it at a clearance price . 
next mission ,  find something ,  get out ,  don t get killed . 
the third time i used the hose it sprang a leak . 
fulfill the requirements of the bonus card while concurrently ending the game . 
when i finally did receive the item it had no expiration date . 
i got it for $ but that was way too much . 
i suppose i can just throw them in the trash . 
 and ,  collectively ,  they cost about fifteen dollars more than this .   . 
my first  good  tv was the num_extend trinitron still working in our bedroom . 
i am now trying to get a refund for my money . 
but what can you expect for the price . 
i changed the rating from num_num stars to num_extend
i have promoted the kitchen trash bags to this special duty . 
firstly it didn t seem to work at all . 
best to trash and remember never buy chun ,  it s always chum . 
i own this product and i own the aqueon equivalent . 
the other thing i didn t like is that it cuts unevenly . 
i really don t like leaving num_num star reviews . 
it is worse than the worst diet soda aftertaste that you can imagine . 
i wish they designed it so that you could still use docking stations . 
the new thing seems to be farming kills in the warsong gulch . 
yeah ,  that s an ointment and not a tea . 
indeed ,  this game delivered a solid rpg gameplay . 
there are other brands that taste much better . 
the next week saw num_num killed by traditional traps with none electrocuted . 
upon startup the printer would then print the job . 
tried using a memorex laser cleaning disc ,  but this did not help . 
i got the appropriate size but my breasts wouldn t stay in it . 
this is a fantastic product that is well made . 
it does not specify ipad num_extend num_extend new ipad num_extend or new ipad num_extend
at $ samsung num_num with its features were hard to pass up . 
then we had two more kids ,  a boy and a girl . 
i got it in a day after ordering using amazon s prime shipping . 
it finally gave out and started to leak oil from the motor . 
in reality ,  though ,  its performace is only average to below average . 
too bad the quality of them is too fragile . 
i did not see an improvement in my hair . 
they ve inflated to num_num and that s just ridiculous . 
takes way too long to charge the battery . 
and then giving you the decision how you want to evolve . 
nothing i have done has corrected this problem . 
i was looking for a bra with no wire and thicker padding . 
tasty or not ,  we don t eat anything that s gmo . 
logitech is not putting out the quality here . 
these would be horrible ingredients even for a human let alone a dog . 
sensitivity may occur after using any pesticide product on pets . 
even more surprising is that this is dermatologist recommended . 
i ordered through subscribe and save and got a good price . 
but it is very difficult to push this stroller . 
i ve always had good luck with tevas and columbias . 
i opened a package and the treats were moldy . 
soap ,  scouring and too long a soak all stripped the patina . 
other than that they product is pretty good . 
much too much hassle for a stupid thermometer . 
took another dose during the day and had the same reaction . 
why not bite or sip caps ?  so the bottles went into storage . 
this product is basically useless for losing weight . 
either way the case itself is great don t get me wrong . 
but some teflon tape wrapped around the end works . 
it was worth it for the scenery alone . 
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings . 
the fact that can sleep with them was a great plus . 
less convenient ,  but it would feel safer to me . 
the ones i ve used have barely made a week . 
letting it sit awhile did not bring a better result . 
never in my life have i experienced such an overhyped lousy product . 
then i started my dynasty with the blue jackets . 
didn t even make it in the mail without breaking . 
i expect these issues will be resolved soon . the ugly :  lag . 
something about this product s overall texture ,  smell and feel had changed . 
all i know is i m sticking to wired headphones . 
but i m pretty sure the instructions said not for water . 
very uncomfortable ,  but maybe i got a defective pair ?  . 
after less than num_num months of use they quit working . 
some more money and go with bushnell or nikon . peace out !  . 
economics seems to be nonexistent . you must play in first person perspective . 
the only upside was that the case was very pretty . 
panasonic said that this was not a machine malfunction . 
i struggled with getting a good grip and just reverted to a comb . 
it is so ugly ive not used it even once . 
many better rings for much less are available . 
my daughter thinks it smells like bug spray . 
just be very careful not to drop it . 
that works fine but the battery packs are horrible . 
i have had better screen protectors it was ok for the money . 
it just bogged down even when cutting half a strip of grass . 
the results with this particular configuration are pretty good . 
i would num_num star this item if i had it to do over . 
this phone is great if you don t need a reliable phone . 
when it worked it was quiet and gave absolutely no problems . 
it is completely useless ,  as it cannot be put together . 
the float is supposed to raise activating the fan . 
i thought it was good ,  but not the greatest fps ever created . 
i really wanted to like this mouth guard . 
not at all like the stuff you but at the pet store . 
death from pyrethrins is a lot more common than many vets think . 
i watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of reviews . 
we bought a medium for num_num year old . 
i mean like trying to cover his entire body in dirt . 
they ll be proud of themselves for always being in every race . 
this one was shot by the time i got to work . 
i will definitely not be repurchasing this eye cream . 
it does increase alertness and it does make you feel energized . 
i ask myself every year ,  why do i do it . 
upon application ,  it smelled offensively like cough syrup . 
tastes like paper mache !  sorry that i ordered a case . 
the ridges also don t really hit my clit very well . 
i agree with another review about expiration date . 
very tight .  .  . the merchant responded only once to my inquiry . 
no fault of the light as it worked just fine . 
i hate these glass s ,  they leak air around foam padding . 
im extremely disappointed in these and would not buy again . 
that s about it however . i would also look at other reviews . 
it was rinsed and immediately dried off after any and all usage . 
this mouse is erratic and unstable with my windows num_num computer . 
it is cheaply made and does not stay in place . 
i accidentally purchased this video head instead of the num_extend
i thought there was too much going on in that regard . 
attributes and permissions  and how linux does so . 
it basically puts them in an addictive love trance . 
i went to rocky who said they have a one year warranty . 
i have a large foot num_extend and they looked like clown shoes . 
my son has no interest whatsoever in the lid or the shapes . 
i mean ,  whats the purpose of showing the other two items ?  . 
the black rubber part is partially white because the black has faded off . 
i wouldn t even expect this out of a knockoff . 
then i smell like this stuff all day . 
does nothave enough power to give a decent shave . 
and i don t care if i ruin it . no more shuns . 
we faithfully cleaned it and used it only once a day . 
i was excited to see they had it and two separate listings . 
that explained the different taste and the aftertaste i got . 
it has that burnt ,  musty taste that lingers in budget teas  exp num_extend
nonetheless ,  we have a couple concerns about usability and num_extend
the back of the truck pulls out and this piece is really flimsy . 
it is my first cast iron pan ,  so i did my research . 
i am now facing a problem with it . 
the main problem is that the camera is jerky . 
ugh !  !  i hope this seller enjoys my donation . 
this device has a problem maintaining a wlan connection . 
i have received no response to my customer service inquiry . 
but once i stopped using it ,  the rash came back with vengence . 
the problem is this thing is just too wide . 
i put my phone around % and plugged it in . 
bummer because this is his favorite mater toon . 
but be beware that this helmet is heavy . 
it smells like a cross between ,  dirty perfume and citrus . 
works ok ,  but you had better not want any service . 
i bought this because i had heard so much about it . 
majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as active num_extend
i think i actually threw out the full bottle . 
you re allowed to switch between the two characters as you like . 
i wish i had gotten the all plastic one . 
i have actually bought num_extend don t ask me why . 
i am num_num not num_num and pamper my belongings . 
i was told fear is a super scary thriller . 
went ahead and ordered storage containers from amazon . 
i was told to return it for a refund . 
i would like to try the other flavors though . 
only have a year to save the stupied num_extend
sorry but way too small and not size num_num for an adult . 
this certainly doesn t even remotely taste like a real cup of kona . 
my daughter received this toy for her num_extend birthday . 
i thought the finished product was sort of watery . 
when i had it installed the first few days it was fine . 
we need good neck support while we sleep . 
the pen is only good for children that have good fine motor skills . 
unfortunately ,  it s too dry to really be a moisturizer . 
for the price  though not expensive  you can do a lot better . 
when he would try to run or jump it wouldn t do anything . 
that s about $ less than the air hogs sharp shooter . 
please note that there was never any strain on the connector . 
i ordered these because of the description ,  corn ,  quinoa and sesame . 
the settings are either really low or really high !  . 
besides being awkward ,  i noticed no difference in cleanliness . 
perhaps someone younger and with quicker reflexes could do better at it . 
maybe they shouldn t have put lead in kids toys . 
she won t even bat it around or bunny kick it . 
please save your money and do not buy this record player . 
french roast when i brew it in my perculator is very robust . 
i bought another compression sack to carry it in . 
they love the taste and smell of them . 
i clean it regularly ,  replace filters ,  and they just stop . 
found the lace to be much too hard . 
now i didn t have a problem with anything melting . 
the wd drives i purchased at the same time are still going strong . 
the addition of the cover system completely defeats the need for stealth . 
fortunately ,  amazon agreed to give me a complete refund . 
the problem we had was people hearing us . 
then attempt to drink .  .  . not sure what i was expecting . 
don t fit like the twill pant or the dickies jeans . 
i hope i cause at least one person to not buy it . 
they are superior in every way and at about $ less . 
i wont be buying this type of case for my phone ever again . 
i suffered back pain after an car accident . 
they look and wear fine for the first week . 
might as well buy the one without the crank . 
i recently purchased the num_extend tourmaline ii dryer and had great expectations . 
from the first day itself it started showing me all of its true num_extend
it does not always give you a good readout the first try . 
one good thing was good lock up and zero play . 
the devices feels like it doesn t have enough processor speed in it . 
the screen is dark too dark i can t see anything . 
also the squirrel is clumsy large for little hands . 
to be honest ,  the towel wasn t really that water  magnet  . 
it s not as emmersive as halo ever was . 
i am hoping that whomever tries the ones i am donating likes it . 
i bought three different brands of toe sox on amazon . 
we hope these stay intact for more than a little while . 
thought because it was lite weight would work . 
as it stands ,  they deserved to watch nintendo and sony destroy them . 
lovely has such strong flowery and citrusy notes . 
it featured nearly everybody from the previous mortal kombat games . 
the only thing good about it is that it is organic . 
however ,  there was a strong ,  overwhelming taste and odor . 
the great battle music gets played to death . 
it is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue . 
it has a undertone of like a plastic chemically smell . 
the gameplay is ok but the controls aer nt very realistic . 
my first and last footwear purchase from amazon . 
awful product ,  won t hold charge ,  lasts less than original battery . 
then i recheck with my other brand and it s not even close . 
please save your money for a better model . 
the other one opened as if it was hydraulically operated . 
comes right up into armpits ,  therefore it is uncomfortable . 
and he dont like organic or any kind of fruit . 
there are times when i want my bag resting on my hip . 
advanced elements make great kayaks but bad pumps !  . 
in the end i think you really get what you pay for . 
this was disappointing for my son who needed these for his wii remotes . 
my cat is impervious to all this gimmicky stuff . 
something about the jolt of electricity must make this work better or something . 
we never even got the chance to wrap it . 
ken s legs are hollow and they do not bend at the knee . 
i had a hard time getting the spout open . 
it looks nice in the photo but is pretty unwearable in person . 
it has been sitting in our playroom for a year . 
and the surprising thing is that amazon is filling the orders . 
this product must be a kids size large . 
excitotoxins have been found to dramatically promote cancer growth and metastasis . 
dont let the kids get there hands on this !  . 
i received a box of casmir from amazon . 
the color of it is really strong and pretty . 
wish it would have worked ,  but it just didn t . 
i noticed the kids also were leaving their cocoa almost untouched . 
with the nyx eyeshadow primer my eyelids are oilier . 
this was my last thing i have not tried . 
this has got to be designed for people with super fine hair . 
mortal kombat was really weak on the snes because it was so censored . 
as it is this case isn t even moisture or humidity resistant . 
i go in on hard and the game is still easy . 
the graphics are of an average num_extend game . 
out of num_num cats only one seems interested in eating it . 
my husband likes dark chocolate ,  as do i . 
not much good if it keeps falling off . 
did not notice any real improvement over acne or other skin blemishes . 
and then leon macks honey whatever her name was . 
overall it is just a very poorly designed game . 
i didn t buy this purifier online ,  but at my local megastore . 
this is a terrible product ,  even for num_num dollar . 
very bad if you mess up ,  there is only one save point . 
it does not a proper rim to protect screen in event phone falls . 
these are so artificial tasting and just plain terrible . 
i do now have num_num nice flat stones on a convenient stand . 
every once in a while it gets lint under the ball . 
i do not like the metal wire that holds these blades together . 
the whole handle broke off another sword the next morning . 
this product definitly puts a stain on thier brand image . 
i will probably try a sennheiser the next time round . 
if they had tried i think these would have caused harm . 
wished it had been a true wide fit . 
or break a potted plant over that zombie s head . 
i was very excited with this game at first . 
then i saw them at my local grocery store for a buck apiece . 
i don t know why ,  but it stings and it smells strong . 
i am ready to throw this in the garbage . 
generally oatmeal is used in skincare as a soothing and moisturizing agent . 
when i got these pants i wanted them to be a little tight . 
i sent this back and opted for the little people school bus instead . 
it s a cheap backpack and you get exactly that . 
the money you spend on this case isn t worth it . 
even though this product was free ,  i cannot recommend it . 
it is soft and flexible and has tons of little nubbies . 
i read in one of the reviews  dont  be fooled by the price  . 
on high speed it is also a bit noisy . 
the real time concept was unique and impressive . 
if it s in the kitchen ,  don t use it . 
i want to build stars ,  direct films ,  and create cinematic masterpieces . 
you may get different results from a different seller . 
had to replace the battery a second time . 
i liked another cushion i got a lot better . 
there are some glitches that might make you question the graphics . 
i read the num_extend script like five hundred times . 
if it was inverted i have no faith that it will retain water . 
but reholstering should never have to be done quickly . 
but dress shoes don t have much padding and aggravate my achilles tendonitis . 
the description clearly states that they are % cotton and % spandex . 
i exercise daily ,  and i finished the entire bottle . 
these glasses look good ,  but not in person . 
don t let the price get the best of you . 
i ordered sterile gauge with num_num in a box . 
i played through red steel ,  which was waaay more fun than this . 
sometimes buttons must be pushed again and again . 
two minutes later it was a throbbing consistent pain . 
i ordered this after all kinds of problems with my jabra icon . 
fortunately it wasn t much money so not a big loss . 
the paint can also get a little sloppy on the head . 
that s when i gave up and tossed it back in the box . 
seems like all food processors are problems ,  these days . 
but lets play the game without reading the manual  wont happen  . 
the only practical use for this is to be a spear head . 
so finally i can not use these protectors . 
she is now left with only the bone to play with . 
every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next . 
given that it is not leak proof ,  the lid is way oversized . 
i love navitas but i wish i could love this . 
i will be buying fila from now on . 
the main objectives are glass ,  but the eyepiece lenses are plastic . 
say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind . 
this cushionn has no support whatsoever and is really worthless . 
but hey you can buy nail files and clear polish anywhere num_extend
it took me a while to realize it was because of the filter . 
this game could have been good if put in the right hands . 
which i wouldnt mind if it was sold as a used item . 
these work great in our num_num gallon tank . 
only a couple seemed not to be derivative of the previous games . 
this product is not of so good quality . 
i assumed i would have problems with it and i was right . 
i will update this product when im almost done with the product . 
this item was very uncomfortable sounded awful and i did not like it . 
i plan to order another one in the future . 
on the contrary ,  i m a big supporter of linux . 
i found this to be one of timothy s least flavorful coffees . 
my old ,  cheap linksys router provides much greater wireless coverage . 
the training string cutter will just break itself immediately . 
lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining . 
forget about reheating them ,  then you re just asking for mush !  . 
if you twist too far ,  they can t get anything out . 
i ll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this . 
i ended up throwing both of mine out as a safety precaution . 
and then i got the blandness that is this cereal . 
lately i seem to need to do this more often . 
i dont know how else to put it . 
i want to give everyone a fair warning when using this seller . 
i love amazon ,  but they really failed me in this instance . 
the lifetime guarantee ?  you need the original packaging and receipt . 
i needed it yesterday and it started getting hot as i pumped it . 
i have heard so many good things about this perfume . 
the cookie crumbles all over the place making a big mess . 
i really enjoyed this remote at first and it did a great job . 
he has separation anxiety issues which i hoped this product would alleviate . 
num_num minutes later it said the battery  case  had no power left . 
i like how they fit ,  but very poor quality for this price . 
also this item so tooo expensive for it not to work . 
what i received was an orangish soft wood . 
as early as num_extend to finally do the right thing . 
i was expecting them to need a garter ,  but they didn t . 
for what this is advertised to me ,  this is a giant disappointment . 
i got it back on ,  but it continued to randomly pop off . 
i dont really like it ,  maybe im using it wrong . 
this maker is not a belgian maker as stated . 
the rust continued for two months and started popping off the enameling . 
it simply showed  no disc  on the display . 
oh well ,  hope you guys have better luck . 
i bought this mount holder for my iphone because of the great price . 
to much running away ,  fighting and pc play was extremely difficult . 
when the first set stopped working ,  i thought i just did something . 
mostly i think the powder just disguises the staining . 
expand the territory and he has time for only quick glances . 
i can get about num_num of them for the price of a bron . 
my main issue is with the packaging as my title suggests . 
i ve past the point of being able to return it . 
definitely not opi or any other brand name quality . 
i can only imagine the pain if it hit someone in the eye . 
the two analog sticks are extremely close together . 
our cats seem to watch it but it s not really chase able . 
what a pointless piece of plastic those are !  as for the popping . 
i was so excited to received my sunglasses to have a big disappointment . 
go cat changed the end of the fur fun toy . 
it is used in this product to make it a gel . 
might be better to let the professional do it . 
even so it s best on a relatively clean chain . 
this case ,  however ,  is not worth the money . 
trader joe s i think has the best hummus there is . 
the main issue i have with the product is the back cover . 
it was huge and really rough feeling to my bare skin . 
but not for salads or eating like raisins . 
the unit was easy to setup and use . 
bought my size in this bra but the straps are way too small . 
it looks easier to maneuver than it actually is . 
after reading the glowing reviews ,  i was ready for a taste treat . 
one of the leds has now started flashing ,  which is very distracting . 
with this phone ,  i refrained from downloading anything ,  period . 
i tried two of these and just got frustrated . 
it did not fade at all with this product . 
the character movements are more fluid .  .  . but almost too fluid . 
but the crate should have been able to hold up . 
num_num days later ,  the fleas are actually worse . 
easy to push ,  suction to pick up cat hair and dust . 
there is no coherence to the game experience that i could discern . 
the graphics had a significantly larger amount of time put into them num_extend
i bought this product selfishly ,  because i like dinosaurs . 
my husband threw the box away and i cannot even take it back . 
lasted just over three years before failing with absolutely no abuse . 
anyways ,  decent game ,  but i got extremely frustrated with the camera . 
the playing screen was also small but the graphics were good . 
i took it off one time and the side broke . 
i have never purchased a cream for my face that was not sealed . 
in larger quantities ,  it is too overwhelming peach a artificial sweetener . 
the visual part of the alarm is almost microscopic in size . 
when you can get the signal ,  they sound good . 
but good old fashion vaccums handle our house just perfectly . 
sorry the unit  over heat motor just stop running after two week . 
some epoxy will likely fix this but still . 
i cant bielive you people would even look at one . 
i pick the game up tonight and manage to beat it . 
mentally ,  i just couldn t immerse myself into the gameworld . 
you can t just wipe one time and be done . 
master of magic allowed you to group units for movement back in num_extend
choosing other company s compactflash is better for you . 
i couldn t find refresh optive here so i ordered plus . 
the reflection is so ridiculous you can t see a thing . 
i bought it because it says cast iron . 
the basketball and the football are much better . 
do youself a favor and stay away from this pile of bat crap . 
i sent them photos of the damage so they could see what happened . 
good if you only need something for a week . 
it would be in their best interest to just replace the bad ones . 
at least this could be shutoff in other burnouts . 
i took them on an empty stomach when i would wake up . 
i cant afford to fall . no ,  do not get them wet . 
i m taking mine back to circuit city for a refund . 
slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag . 
oh ,  and the cats hardly ever played with it . 
if you use cooking spray ,  it ruins the pans . 
the cord was longer than i needed ,  but not too bad . 
do yourself a favor and buy a brinks timer instead . 
i did not get what i ordered ,  so review is tricky . 
you ll do much better with a hoky broom or a swiffer . 
what a waste of cash on this stuff . 
i ve had my pavoni burr grinder for over a month now . 
i took it and the knives to a professional for sharpening . 
i am so surprised by hartz on this one . 
i didnt wait long for it to get here . 
my bird is still plucking after trying num_num bottles of it . 
it comes in great packaging and it does what it says . 
a friend recommended this cause it worked great on her dog . 
at a single jefferson ,  it seemed too good to be true . 
he does creative imaginative play with lots of other toys and misc . 
would be interested to see if anyone else had this problem . 
i bought a liteone dvd recorder in november num_extend
the clip will break ,  its a matter of how soon . 
you need big huge ear holes to fit these into your ears . 
your confidence in our products and continued goodwill are very important to us . 
also ,  the expansion disks are  to my mind  worthless . 
the straps that go around the back also dug into my daughters arms . 
i use the cord to power my controllers . 
lara is just not meant to be analog . 
it is a piece of junk !  stay away . 
look for a better one ,  don t waste your money . 
includes a substandard num_extend player for your computer with no equalizer . 
i have been using van ness cat litter scoops for years . 
i purchased the longstrike to add to my cubicle arsenal at work . 
see the attached photo   when it appears   to see the problem . 
like coffee with a lot of milk in it . 
something i ve not experienced with any other gluten free products . 
i love m n d but this chalk is going in the trash . 
used less than a dozen times before motor began to smell . 
it s going straight back and i m very disappointed . 
i returned the product because i did not receive what i ordered . 
my son would usually just grab the lid and knock the thing over . 
i have used hogues in the past and loved the ones i used . 
the driver magnet fell out ,  so bits don t stay in place . 
you will get far more pleasure out a dollar double cheeseburger anyhow . 
unit was great until the motor died after six months . 
i think this is supposed to work but it absolutely does not . 
that is ,  you cannot access the internet at all . 
with a knife it might only take about num_num minutes . 
i bought a new chassis for my num_extend
the iron heats up well ,  but the barrel snags my hair which . 
my kid played it for a week then he moved on . 
first ,  the material seemed very thin and the zippers smallish . 
they look neat ,  sound fair ,  and tangle quite easily . 
after about num_num months of light use they just sort of fell apart . 
to begin with ,  i don t care for the scent . 
 :  if they change back ,  somebody please let me know !  !  . 
i still use them from time to time ,  though . 
i have really weak ,  peeling ,  and soft nails . 
i ve actually been using the unit now for a week . 
the previous brand of slim cases i bought are much better . 
i have been looking for a pair of warm ankle boots . 
there i have said everyhting good about this . 
other than my complaing ,  thanks for reading through my complaing !  . 
don t expect miracles ,  like a sudden increase in mpg . 
this is the first time i have seen this type of discrepancy . 
chi chewed the ends off of this in num_num minutes . 
sprint like htc to build them cheap cheap cheap . 
last time i ordered the absolute least expensive one . 
i like vanilla flavored coffee and expected to like this . 
i have bought the pink and blue version . 
it made me break out worse than i already was . 
for the price though it wasnt worth the hassel . 
the terk edge takes an ok signal and makes it disappear . 
i still kept looking for another one and found it locally . 
i only got mild burning of my eyes . 
the only reason i give it two stars is that it is  cute  . 
people have actually commented on how pretty it looks . 
the net pictured here must be a num_extend num_extend umbrella . 
it is a little sweet but no trace of chocolate or raspberry . 
our mini dachshund wouldn t even give this toy a second look . 
believe me ,  the sonys are good for the money . 
my husband and i researched a variety of breadmakers . 
 in all fairness ,  it may not be anxiety in the puggle . 
i am comparing this to the jubralee bra that i like much better . 
if i put this on over the moisturizer ,  it s super shiny . 
the sifting causes the clumps to break apart . 
this game is john woo in every way ,  style and no substance . 
you can get stabbed in the back quite frequently with an antenna . 
i kind of wish i could return it since it s pretty expensive . 
the legs are very fragile and break off very easily . 
it wasn t bad ,  it just wasn t very good . 
even though ?  i; never had any problems with it . 
constant disconnects with my intel pro num_extend for no good reason . 
so ,  i ended up having to throw it away . 
it turns out its warranty return address is bogus . 
i wish nerf would stop making more reshelled recon . 
after i used this unit twice i returned it for a refund . 
i thought these would be decent for the price . 
too bad ,  because as leg warmers go ,  they are not cheap . 
it may work for some dogs just not mine . 
still ,  that doesn t remove the frustration factor from this one . 
i have no idea how well this would moisturize over the long term . 
the large container held a seal but within one hour had leaked . 
it also does not take up a lot of space . 
not at all a  healthy  snack ,  though better than some . 
none of the parts really fit right and work together . 
it looks great ,  but the reviews on amazon give me caution . 
the small sizes seem to accommodate only narrow feet . 
this armband has a really long strap making it too big for women . 
figures out who the other player picked first  wins . 
i feel like i m just putting lotion under my eyes . 
the fit is described as bulky in shoes . 
i am a num_extend and ordered my size in ivory . 
just little bits of fuzz stuck to everything . 
may be some barbie campers would love this junk . 
it tones down brassiness ok but only until the next shampoo . 
all the accuracy ,  but without the significant health risks if it breaks . 
i tryed it , it just didn t rock my boat . 
nothing on the front ,  and it is very slim . 
the obstacles ?  other creatures are trying to collect parts too . 
first one died exactly num_num days after purchase . 
another time the bottom gave out while carrying him up the stairs . 
little did i know it was the beginning of a trend . 
it did not help me lose weight at all . 
it s just too narrow to put my foot into the holder . 
i want to point out ,  my problem is fairly common . 
this item is probably best for dogs five pounds and under . 
the small is too small to be practical for much . 
or should i spend it on something more useful . 
unless you have strong gums and a healthy mouth . 
the cannisters themselves are nice and heavy with no imperfections . 
also i did not like the coler combo on it . 
frustrating cause i love the look of this case . 
the cellet version seems to be more reliable and has padded ear piece . 
sadly it lasted for about num_num months of daily used before it failed . 
the instructions also don t say to flip the pancake . 
it does not glow in the dark at all . 
the game that does exsist however is good . 
nicely defined ,  shiny ,  gorgeous curls were what it produced . 
it just doesn t deliver the same kind of excitement . 
i do like the design if it would just fit . 
apartment buildings give every player their own space ,  right off the bat . 
my cats not interest in this thing at all . 
battle graphic is pixellated almost as the word map . 
these work as a num_num backup light but not a num_extend
finally a few months later it is dead . 
i too moved it around to various locations with the same lopsided results . 
after num_num days you ll just be trying to sell it . 
i am big chested ,  but these clearly run small . 
the legends are nothing to write home about . 
i purchased the herb pharm lemon balm extract mineral after seeing dr . 
i echo other reviewers  that the clip on the cover seems superfulous . 
i kept losing things out of it such as money . 
i used this tea many years ago and it was okay tasting . 
i succumbed to the hype of the razr ,  but was burned . 
the weapons are uninspiring and the enemies aren t that amazing at all . 
my toes are completely bunched up and there s no give . 
please do have that soy part written in larger print . 
purchased as a replacement for a whirlpool no . 
it totally separated from the hose itself . piece of crap . 
suddenly ,  i had the worst heart palpitations in my life . 
when i saw the price was num_extend i checked my sams receipt . 
we tried something different every time we took her to the vet . 
perhaps with a poor review the company will get the message . 
 hint ,  it cost num_extend what they sell for on amazon . 
i struggled with this for a long time . 
this game however ,  just feels so  been there ,  done that .   . 
there is absolutely no way to adjust or fix this problem . 
and loose while other people just do the exact strategy to win . 
i think my expectations may have been a bit high . 
it was watery ,  too salty ,  and there were not many lentils . 
i knew that fisher price stood behind their products so i chanced it . 
to me it kinda looks like toy story or such . 
i love the num_num though ,  that s a real killer machine . 
i started by filling each container to its capacity with num_num degree water . 
hope this helps and saves you a thousand dollars . 
and the promised version num_extend appears to be vaporware . 
the fun of it stopped at metroid zero mission . 
unfortunately ,  the story is barely there and the characterization is nil . 
i m upset that i got this pallet and wasted my money . 
time which i should have been dedicating to other projects . 
it is a lighter weight than the one with the smooth handles . 
fortunately it was my mom s money ,  not mine . 
not pathetic  criminal  is the sizing of these . 
for around $ this is just an ok tpu case . 
the player still mistracks sometimes on any disc that i play . 
the problem is that ,  after the great opening sequence ,  nothing happens . 
this could have been a contender ,  but it isn t . 
the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent ,  though subtle . 
ordered this backpack because jansport use to make good quality gear . 
the cable is good ,  but it does not fit the samsung galaxy num_extend
the flip cover gets in the way when the phone is used . 
it helps to regulate calcium transport and absorption . 
i also bought the dmae cream and that was fine . 
she prefers other brands that are usually organic . 
i bought this product a little over a year ago . 
the mochaccino flavor is pretty good ,  but is chaulkier than wheybolic . 
i have two of these different models both panasonic . 
the only one with a lens that was fully seated . 
so at least it has that going for it . 
i ended up getting a universal laser that fits . thanks , john . 
another configuration is a full wavelength antenna ,  about num_num feet long . 
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes . 
i figured they d be a big hit with me too . 
it feels very flimsy ,  and looks very cheap . 
looks like from other reviews that the product has been changed . 
as if there were not already enough memory formats ,  yet another one . 
i don t trust it to be enough in an emergency . 
other friskies flavors are even worse than this one . 
string did not break as i rather expected ,  but it looks bad . 
it hurts a lot and it doesn t remove the hair completely . 
the plastic also only wraps two edges ,  and the silicone is soft . 
perhaps i need to use it for an extended period of time . 
however ,  i was disappointed in the quality of the product . 
you can build up an infinite supply of elements like this . 
wish i would have read the reviews here before buying . 
i think a younger group would find this more enjoyable . 
i much prefer biolage conditioning balm for my dry hair . 
the lemon and orange flavors literally made me gag . 
no effect for me ,  beyond being a somewhat heavy moisturizing cream . 
every parent i ve spoken with that purchased one says the same thing . 
less background hiss ,  nicer balance of tonality ,  and overall pleasantness . 
never received a response from the manufacturer about technical support . 
i wanted one from the day i first say it in a magizine . 
i had to stop using it for the sake of my eyes . 
the clippers were loose and could bend the cat s nail before clipping . 
you need a gps dongle  see below  to get navigation to work . 
it causes memory dumps that corrupts running programs . 
secondly ,  the box is enormous so you think you getting some logs . 
put one loop over the end of your booted foot . 
the description states there is a  locating pin  . 
not one that but now my hair feels like hay . 
dont know who the kind reviewers are trying to please . 
these seemed nice ,  so i thought i d give them a try . 
it also works world wide on wifi for $ a month . 
the timer clicks down but doesnt ring at zero . 
the num_extend spring is great ,  the plate is also really good . 
if you are one currently debating ce vs . 
this holster i could tell is high quality from day one . 
she loves elmo and she loves to talk on the phone . 
i have tried four discs and three have been coasters . 
this is the worst canned pineapple i have ever tried . 
sorry ,  but i wasted my money so save yours . 
no error message ,  no response ,  no startup ,  nothing . 
i think it might be one of the antiseptics they use . 
this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses . 
this item is not suitable for my delonghi ec num_num espresso machine . 
in the world of slr photography ,  $ is nothing . 
they also were not as clear as others . 
a serving of this stuff has an incredible num_extend of sugars per cup . 
the ball needs to be lighter and a little smaller . 
i bought this product based on the reviews i read here . 
maybe that will redeem it enough to keep it . 
clanners are using teamspeak ,  etc .  ,  non clanners can t compete . 
i was dissapointed in the size of the blocks . 
this battery will not hold a charge and was returned . 
returned them via amazon printed ups label over num_num weeks ago . 
customer service requires an id number which is not provided with this version . 
the best way to enjoy it if you want to own it . 
i saw the tingle factor and figured it wouldn t bother me . 
iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best . 
apparently the two i went through didn t work . 
the turbine spins ,  but it doesnt help to pick anything up . 
unfortunately for me i wasted my money on this . 
this is not built to last by any means . 
i contacted sony because i thought it was a defect . 
they are not true to size what so ever . 
the whole project took less than two hours . 
i don t get the love for this game . 
we can barely see the rainbow on my daughter s wall . 
the case looked better online ,  than in hand . 
not one worked for more then a few minutes . 
it does the job but there are no drivers for windows vista . 
purchased for father and ordered his normal size . 
so it is worth it if you actually get them all . 
but it s clearly a jug and not a dainty pitcher . 
will be returning to store first thing tomorrow . 
first of all ,  i was never a real madden enthusiast . 
the activity card is missing from my package . 
this product is designed to elevate your forefoot ,  which stretches your calves . 
i disagree with anyone who said this game lacked graphics . 
most good ones the velcro is sewn in . 
no problem with the seller ,  just the product . 
although this looks like a solid tool ,  it s not . 
i m not even going to try to get another one . 
first off this is nothing like the plastic teething bones . 
it is the same knife ,  but the handle is a different color . 
finally ,  their tech support is about as bad as it gets . 
the biggest one being how cheaply it is made . 
after four months it died on me ,  do i trashed it . 
the original half life was a masterpiece in this area . 
after that ,  i came home and read the ingredients more closely . 
not a fan of cd and will not purchase again . 
before you purchase this realize how think num_num inches is . 
so you just can t do something else while he rambles . 
after it began to fail ,  i purchased num_num more . 
and its alot easier scrubbing a chain if its off the bike . 
i slid the game into the wii and started it up . 
tried one more time a couple weeks ago . 
the orange door on the sorter will not stay shut . 
nice in design but whomever manufactured it ,  used the lowest quality materials . 
i gave this case to my boyfriend for christmas . 
i honestly dont get why its rated so high . 
spend a little bit more and purchase a quality product . 
when i recieved it it was not fully submersible only partially . 
i ve only used this mixer maybe num_num times before it blew up . 
so i had to reclean the screen again . 
the pacing in this game is abusively frenetic . 
but that is exactly why i like them . 
it seems eyepiece thread was not there or broken . 
prior to this breaking ,  it did make good coffee . 
it was a more tightly woven type instead of shaggy . 
sometimes we wish she had chosen a different family to be adopted by . 
this was an expensive lesson of what didn t work for me . 
i meant to purchase xl briefs ,  rather than underwear . 
i thought buying a cuisinart toaster would insure a lasting appliance . 
using it alone does nothing to block out outside  of the room  noises . 
good idea which was poorly and cheaply executed . 
do not buy this until the problems with the seals is fixed . 
i did not like this case at all . 
my six month old puppy had the handle chewed off in one day . 
even spent a lot of time looking up troubleshooting methods online . 
there doesn t seem to be any consistency with the flight pattern . 
i was so happy to find this rack . 
i still use one in each of my num_extend tanks . 
i assume there is a magnet causing this . 
they remind me of cheap watercolor brushes for kids . 
the only thing they have going for them is that they are cute . 
may work for others who do not take meds . 
i used to love their designs and thought they were innovative . 
when i awoke having cpr preformed on me . 
and there was no sound leakage yet very loud when you wear em  . 
to say they weren t would be a vast understatement . 
i spent the next hour ,  maybe longer on the toilet . 
i bought two of these and thought at first they were great . 
product right now comes out to about a buck a can . 
beware !  the lens gets stuck on the camera  google + youtube  . 
i bought this for smoke smell in a used car . 
num_extend the cost of vx accessories are too high . 
wath happend with customer service of you for cash purchases . 
the only thing good about this thing is its pretty . 
way too undersized for what i was looking for . 
i felt totally tricked by purchasing this product . 
in my experience ,  it does perform admirably as a deodorant . 
i got a different leash that works very well for no pulling . 
i guess a week tops and they will short out . 
and ten more minutes of patience and button pushing accomplishes absolutely nothing . 
all of the guns in killing floor were crippling . 
i wish they were a bit more subtle of colors . 
swing stick takes time to get used to ,  but it is doable . 
i switched to a small mist bottle filled with water . 
why the reviews for this are so glowing i cannot figure . 
i would have given it num_num stars because it is so well made . 
i would guess this size num_num roughly equals an actual size num_extend
i just bought a pack of num_num at target of $
the features were just overkill in my opinion . 
spend another num_num dollars and get something better . 
it fit but man is it scratchy material !  . 
i hate to think how this really affects the fish . 
you loses your weapons at least twice in the game . 
these go stale faster than you can imagine . 
so unrecamendale unless you love live to death . peace . 
i couldn t keep taking it since it constipated me . 
it is very hard maybe that was the problem . 
this is a nice case for num_num sd cards . 
these seem even more rough on the surface . 
this one sold on amazon fails to do the job . 
might be good for you ,  but really doesn t have much taste . 
these taste like they are organic and vegan . 
i called them as well ,  they said call melitta . 
mine broke the first time i used it . 
well what can you expect from a cheap product . 
the motor still works ,  but the brushes no longer spin . 
this shouldn t even be a point of consideration . 
lots of very cool water and blur effects . 
plus the filling got all over the floor . 
and their point guard scores % of the points . 
it was inexpensive with free shipping so i thought why not . 
not so much gi as it is gi reject . 
the weapons range from the interesting to the downright twinkish . 
at first it worked very poorly but over time it got worse . 
the game s story and fighting method sound very interesting . 
it could have just been my attitude over the smell . 
it was fun driving to new objectives at night during the rain . 
this product ,  with four peptides ,  seems promising at first glance . 
the ad says it can handle mega bass ,  but it doesn t . 
my num_num month old kittens won t touch wellness kitten canned food . 
the tips of the tiny screw drivers were poorly shaped and bent easily . 
it is like putting a shoes made of steel on . 
the advertised picture is of an original htc data cable . 
additionally ,  being a lodge product usually brings higher expectation as well . 
they were not the same measurements as stated in the description . 
i tried it in different places in my home as well . 
try as i might ,  i could not get off the color . 
instead he s stealing all the little dog toys now . 
bacon adulterated in this way cooks up nasty . 
i purchased these shoes because i have neuropathy in my feet . 
its very strong and i did not like it at all . 
i did not expect i would be writting this review for this product . 
as expected it sheds and is not as long as the image displays . 
not cheesy enough for me but its handy for lunch . 
you use this product and you ll wish you had bought something else . 
it probably would only have cost them pennies to add snap buckles . 
this was at least a full size too small . 
it just dug into the skin leaving a red mark . 
i can t imagine why anyone would design such a piece of garbage . 
i can t believe anyone would sell a product this bad . 
they fell through the bottom of the cup . 
i would not recommend this bra to anyone . 
this item was cheap and is cheaply made . 
i don t mean cool george romero or resident evil zombies either . 
on one toy ,  the helmet was coming off . 
sad to say no one will eat it . 
used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed . 
spend your money on something else of better quality . 
next time i ll spend a few dollars more and get something decent . 
lesson learned ,  buy a product you are familiar with . 
this has vitamins b num_extend c ,  and d . 
the wii game looks like turok from the num_extend
she is about as discerning as a dog can be . 
the ice would shoot up the sides and stick there . 
there are num_num different ways to install it and i ve tried all num_extend
my toes felt like they were pushing through the front . 
very similar to any shine serum you can pick up at the drugstore . 
below are my thoughts on the jabra num_extend
this is the worst mouth guard i ve ever tried . 
needs a more elastic and wider band ,  not much but some . 
felt like nothing individually ,  felt almost slightly warm joined . 
there are too many appendages that are easily torn off . 
for a slim case with decent protection get the uag case . 
i really really really wanted a gauge after using this one . 
the opening and closing of the boom turns the headset on and num_extend
i would definitely buy setton farms premium pistachios again . 
the search is on again for something that can help . 
the quality is not as good as expected . 
also the rubbery part is badly made and squeaks . 
i can t beleive that anyone would think that this game is fun . 
it is like wearing a headband around your ribcage . 
also ,  it has a terrible and strong rubbery smell . 
levi has a very difficult to decipher part number . 
i will keep this one as a backup case . 
he smells them but wont do anything else . 
but i have not seen any serious problems on my computer . 
you then have to press play to get it to go . 
it would be nice for other people though . 
you have to have the volume all the way up to use headphones . 
the camera is awful ,  never in the right place . 
wasn t a horrible purchase but not for me . 
and have enjoyed most of them although i find some better than others . 
the design and technology on this item is not good . 
he still had the same symptoms as if he had taken nothing . 
i bought num_num and one broke so i m down to one now . 
num_num month later and the thing stopped working . 
i was given a refund and told i could keep the set anyway . 
she loved the bling but could not use it . 
they refuse to tell it and don t have organic ingredients . 
the yellow you can see from the moon ,  i think . 
i m not a gourmet coffee critic ,  but this stuff is disappointing . 
it was a good idea ,  but poor execution . 
besides that ,  it smells very bad and medicinal . 
it was way too short n too wide not like the pic . 
i bought this unit because of the rave reviews . 
the most tedious ,  time consuming mess i ve ever played . 
i read on here it smelled like roses . 
i guess it did save my phone though . 
there are a lot of other games out there . 
children are not typically going to see egg written ,  but egg . 
it is real wood yes ,  but super light weight wood . 
dont like it and do not reccommend to a verizon phone user . 
none of my birds  finches ,  canaries ,  parakeets   would use this bath . 
this in addition to sugar which is half fructose . 
sounds good on paper ,  but nothing but junk . 
the mice have to be very small to even fit into these traps . 
but i just can t risk battery leakage any longer . 
left earpiece stopped working after num_num months of casual use . 
my son who is adhd had no interest at all in this toy . 
the other half ,  he d sniff them and just walk away . 
 isatis root and leaf  was formerly num_extend now only num_extend
it bends very easily ,  especially when it s a little heated . 
the copperhead s consistently are among the poorest performing bbs i have tried . 
the picture shows the num_num with  solingen germany  marked on the blade . 
the ad claims $ but i was charged $ in shipping . 
last years title was way too slow especially num_extend
the barking sound is not too loud and really amuses them . 
i wish i could have made this work . 
i would purchase something else for more money . 
they sat on my head or my desk always . 
you can use new items ,  and that s about it . 
this isn t the game they said it would be . 
thank you amazon for taking care of your customers . 
one will not stay plugged in the phone unless you hold it in . 
the substitution was white and i believe was a taradactal . 
the problem i have with sony is overtime the cds become unreadable . 
i m just disappointed that i didn t get to enjoy the cover . 
human action is a little better ,  but there s little of it . 
regular priced items in any drug store can do the job !  . 
threads are weak and the sight hole was not large enough . 
i don t know ,  but think it could be a possibility . 
i m afraid this won t stand up to extreme weather or wind . 
i tried using this for three weeks and never caught a single anything . 
another reviewer recommended beeswax ,  and i could not agree more . 
not only that ,  sometimes the cops will join in too . 
my husband also commented that the scent was very strong . 
i was shock that one of the buttons says  get lost  . 
now it is num_num months later and i suspect another infection is starting . 
the spindles are riveted to the underside of the top shelf . 
it is so very annoying it is not a good buy at all . 
but i don t think they re worth it in the long run . 
don t waste your money buy the wheel chocks . 
unlike cd ,  md is a dream to record on . 
no matter what grind you select ,  it s all the same . 
into the trash since i threw the box away already . 
the artificial intelligence is also improved over many previous games . 
second try was with all hoses connected with connector tee s . 
in the future ,  i ll buy another popper of better quality . 
recommend you find a better company to buy this battery from . 
then he squeaks them so they talk back . 
i would prefer to eat quaker ohs !  and they are always cheapier . 
turns out that this almond oil actually smelled nothing like almonds . 
buy accordingly to your own phyical physical shape . 
i tried to press it back on but it wouldn t go . 
i couldn t get any digital stations for more than a split second . 
not worth two cents do not waste your time ordering this case . 
the material and zips are not that impressive . 
maybe it would work if you left it on one place . 
i could even live with that if amazon carried the replacement wires . 
in some cases that is fun and exhilirating . 
it s too slippery for me and i m returning it . 
my hair is pretty dry and becomes frizzy easily . 
it wasn t really comfortable and i had a tough night sleeping . 
it burned my digestive tract and stomach after two uses . 
the filter s rated up to num_num gallons and was running on num_extend
i needed a new one ,  there was a sale . 
two packs of bars come in each order advertised as vac . sealed . 
then the flashing green lights of death that others have documented started . 
i received these as a christmas gift from my wife . 
it pains me to say this is a piece of ka junk . 
maybe it s just not strong enough for me . 
here the added sugar was the whole taste . 
la tortilla needs to try again on this product . 
the game play also gets repetitive after a while . 
odd and disturbing enough to make me not use the cream . 
no so these gloves were by far the worst yet . 
i also couldn t get the headset settings commands to work at all . 
very unfortunate ,  these are the real deal sambas ,  just didnt fit . 
this would be great for someone with cable but not directv . 
i cannot recommend unless you like watery weak coffee . 
ok ,  i expect a dud once in awhile . 
amazon sent me a replacement and that one broke after only one use . 
next time he couldn t get it to shoot . 
otherwise hold on the line .   i couldn t believe it . 
in other words ,  meat waste . but lets go back to sugar . 
you couldn t even hear all of the music tracks . 
bought for my mom  .  .  . picture does not do justice . 
but anyways ,  it just hasn t been working out enough . 
it took about num_num weeks to get this product after placing order . 
non of these will hold a samsung epic . 
it now will not open the cdr tray no matter what i do . 
this is not a fruit and nut bar . 
this slow down is even more apparent in superstar mode . 
but the entire time the government is chasing them trying to kill them . 
no wonder they were discounted !  i get hiss num_num feet away  alot  . 
i am on the small side of a num_extend and prefer minimizer bras . 
i have two problems with this game :  first ,  the violence . 
i have taken them for num_num months without any noticeable difference . 
these are all failings that this game has . 
a big thumbs down to their false advertising . 
i am actually a huge fan of canon optics . 
i wish i knew their secret to making it work !  . 
the old verision allowed a full even footprint . 
i m not sure what the rave is all about . 
i bought the setting powder but it never works . 
sometimes it might be worth it ,  but not here . 
it  would be nice if you had the option to use a controller . 
this stuff is so cheaply made it s a joke . 
there is no flat bottom to set it down . 
then the banana and the apple crisp was just ok . 
the rubber case material has gotten almost sticky and can t be cleaned . 
this didn t happen before i started using this product . 
i dont believe this cable was made by cisco . 
the lens broke and then were thrown awaya waste of money . 
in this game ,  you can t even see where you re going . 
if that s not bad enough ,  the instructions were no help whatsoever . 
i kept waking up with a dead phone . 
this is my third pot for this coffee maker . 
so far ,  we are unable to kill a mole with this trap . 
and ,  i must say ,  i really like the mouse . 
i sent it in for repair again and it just returned . 
for me these just didn t meet my expectations . 
i have used ocusoft plus pads in the past and love them . 
also the formula was too drying and waxy feeling . 
there is something wrong with the handle ,  it stuck to my hair . 
the color was about the same too come to think of it . 
not good !  !  will not stick my lashes on at all !  . 
they have always been high quality and wore very well . 
within one second and one bite ,  the eyeball was removed and eaten . 
we had the original bees and our dog loved them as a puppy . 
be forewarned that intel has stopped supporting this product . 
okami is a game that really stood out for me . 
french roast is typically my favorite type of roast . 
spore relies on ea to maintain activation servers . 
i spend more time yelling than enjoying the game . 
these however were one of my worst experiences yet . 
but i suppose this means it will be very secure . 
he likes the dark blue label ,  and the orange label the best . 
the cons really do take away the enjoyability of the game . 
trying to connect to my motorola num_extend is very hit and miss . 
and the new one worked fine right out of the box . 
but other than that ,  like i said ,  cute little boxes !  . 
i was looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about . 
i didn t see any visible brightness of the one washed arm . 
the bra minimizes for appearance and the back support was not anything great . 
almonds crack more teeth than any other nut . 
so gta : lcs with those improvements was a better game . 
so this is pretty mainstream hardware and software we re talking about . 
amazon has put a hold on the product while they check their inventory . 
he ll still eat the strips ,  but won t touch these . 
or zicam cold remedy . good luck ,  and get well !  . 
feel like i paid too much for them . 
in the actual title it states there is enough for num_num people . 
fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail . 
all these five star reviews really awe me . 
i was happy to give this little bar a try . 
the opening is limited by the design of the clasp opening in . 
the graphics are mediocre ,  while the playability is absolutely horrible . 
i used them consistently for months ,  and they really work well . 
this granola is not near as good as many others i have tasted . 
no more pulling ,  no nicks ,  and a closer shave . 
i should have paid attention to the other reviewers num_extend
totally different than any other spyderco i have . 
it is presented as doing more than it does . 
but this game was like all old and {edited} and stuff . 
regardless polder ,  please fix this problem and come out with a successor . 
i ve got a through puncture after num_num commute rides . 
i have num_num playful cats and none were interested in this toy . 
i recommend you do not buy this product as it is . 
itou  if you want to see a real japanese knife . 
just used mine in num_num days and it was broken after that . 
this glue doesn t stick as well as i thought it would . 
i ordered two ,  and one of the came broken . 
do yourself a favor and find a new brand . 
i figured that the  expensive $ batteries may have failed and replaced them . 
well i thought this was a good idea . 
very puzzling is the fact that not a hint of garlic flavor . 
i purchased my first linksys router  exactly the same model  in num_extend
it seems the device has been used before . 
these are nothing special and again ,  they are very tiny . 
couldn t return it became a deposit for the trash . 
i am learning to buy tried and true or make it myself . 
i sent back and switched to maevn ,  which are great . 
it is very tought to pull this knife from the sheath . 
she learned to crawl fine ,  without watching pooh as an example . 
different story . first of all ,  the smell is bad . 
i bought this for a close friend of mine . 
you have to keep recycling until you see the leds num_extend
for other phones ,  they seem to run $ or more . 
they are not as soft as i was hoping . 
to make matters worse ,  their animations take a long time . 
do not have to smell the vinegar smell . 
in fact i am going to stick to that one . 
i would avoid this due to it s lack of quality . 
literally does not have a single other useful purpose in the kitchen . 
other than that ,  you can t go just anywhere . 
this has all the features you would want in a usb car charger . 
low volume and no way to disable vocalist service . 
no need to go into detail ,  it s just a bad game . 
now i understand why most liked the product . 
i don t know where the antenna is  it s hidden  . 
i like to play franchise mode with the fantasy draft . 
took out one card ,  and it still won t snap . 
the face was ripped off in an hour . 
don t be as stupid as the levi corporation . 
my puppy didn t like ,  would not even carry around or try . 
seems even in the future that is still a problem . 
when it is actually working ,  it does the job quite well . 
so we have a large collection of all sort of puzzles . 
not so neat when trying to focus at num_num yards or less . 
i bought this because of all the terrific reviews . 
it went from being ruddy looking to clean and clear and glowing . 
i am an hsp with neck problems and fms . 
worked great ,  i was very happy for about num_num minutes recording time . 
strangely this lens is not tempered glass ,  so it is really useless . 
a week later my hair just started to fall like crazy . 
my num_num year old beagle loves this food . 
im gonna go with no on this one just to be safe . 
a pack of cookie mix at walmart is around num_num dollars . 
i had to start all over from the begaining . 
worked only about a week then my scalp started to scale again . 
the eldest tears it apart to get to ball then thats it . 
other times it gives me really ridiculous numbers . 
there needs to be another snap at the ankle . 
you get num_num try and that is it . 
not what i thought the product was supposed to . 
it is a synthetic form of vitamin k num_extend
i found myself instinctively reaching for them all the time . 
still a fun accessory to have in my bag . 
i am very much looking forward to using this product . 
did not last at all ,  was not worth my money . 
i think every zelda game is worth trying out even this one . 
i then realize that my characters don t have their long swords equipped . 
six weeks later ,  i got the motor back . 
i brought this game assuming that the graphics will be realistic . 
the driver was slightly larger allowing for a much fuller sound reproduction . 
i had no idea there was so much lactose in this product . 
num_num of them were busted and the entire bottle looked like milk . 
decided we hated it and gave it away . 
bottomline :  this filter is not compatible with mr . 
it s insane ,  how much he loves this toy . 
i wish i had read some of these reviews before i purchased . 
i was concerned about the crushed velvet but that is not a problem . 
i needed a swim pants to stop my legs from burning . 
essential oils are much too concentrated and are nothing like the whole plant . 
i had a coupon and my local store had this on sale . 
dungeons are nearly impossible to beat ,  even with num_extend
this product caused more headaches than its worth . 
he never once chewed on it or tried to tear it apart . 
go elsewhere and buy % cotton patches ,  not this junk . 
i can t say whether this product gets rid of wrinkles . 
and i am not a vegetarian or environmental activist . 
this has something in it that doesn t work for me . 
the civil war guns are known for being highly inaccurate . 
if the pressure drops you are in a heap of trouble . 
only bought this because we could not get alternative . 
but it just seemed repetitive and fiddly with little payoff . 
i liked these binoculars so much i purchased a second pair . 
i liked the fact of the royal jelly ingredient . 
just check out what is in this stuff . 
however we can t seem to keep thing thing standing up . 
i have tried this on many different ,  mint conditions dvds . 
no ,  i would not recomend these to anyone . 
inc .   ,  they no longer can supply me with this product  . 
guess my cat is just well fed and lazy . 
and did i mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome . 
same experience as everyone else who talks about it . 
it created a little bit of a mess each time i used it . 
my buddy had to sharpen the crap out of the knife part . 
i get terrible peppermint burps from this product . 
that s a good way of describing this tea . 
so i have to give credit for that . 
i have bone spurs and feet pain from arthritis  hands also  . 
never buy a reserve part of linksys equipment in advance num_extend
i have enjoyed  to some extent  every myst game that preceded this one . 
i regretted buying this cologne before trying it at a store . 
very good screen protector ,  no finger print on the screen . 
just a couple of nights at the gym for a hour or so . 
we both take about num_num supplemenets per day of many types . 
they emailed me saying it was water damage and not under warranty . 
only takes two batteries ,  and they last awhile  i use rechargeables  . 
the price is cheap but so is the product . 
make no mistake; this was a promising idea . 
well it appears to be a different story with the coffee maker . 
this pattern continued until i changed out of the pants . 
it s straight but so thick it constantly breaks hair ties even . 
the rubber streched out easily ,  the hard case scratched easily . 
previous versions ,  when winamp did a cddb lookup the num_num would reboot . 
i never even put them in the dishwasher . 
but i m not putting it in the bath again . 
this will give you the same game but without the annoying bars . 
those are the things i m ultimately looking for . 
look ,  for $ you re getting a decent gun . 
i would recommend looking elsewhere for your foil cutter . 
and the case itself holds all of her lps ,  which is great . 
had high hopes for this based on the reviews . 
i did not like the look of the leather . 
got hooked on bsn products thru no xplode . 
for that many calories ,  this drink has to be loaded with sugar . 
do not buy this product ,  i was more than disappointed . 
never had a problem with the screen going blank . 
so no ,  i do not recommend this to anyone . 
smells like something old like my grandma s makeup . 
i sent it back  right out of the box .   . 
this is flimsy ,  made of very soft aluminum . 
as some other reviewers have noted ,  the welds are weak . 
i was really excited to get this toy for my son . 
none of the horses will stand up on their own . 
my suggestion is buy a better protectors than these . 
if you bought num_num jars there was an added number to call . 
thankfully the price was too inexpensive to really bother returning it . 
the biggest ones will hold a sheet of paper on a refrigerator . 
i didn t realize that num_extend magnification was not very much . 
also fast shipping got the product fast but not good for me  !  . 
if the quality matched the ease of install it d be num_num stars . 
the container was secured with a piece of masking tape . 
i live in denver ,  so the humidity is generally low . 
i am returning the last num_num bottles i ordered . 
just stopped working . over the years we thought it was ok . 
this was a nightmare for all of us . 
too bad you can t even jump on enemies anymore . 
i tried it a few times with the same results . 
sheets are soft and i like the num_extend
but i don t have that much time to mess with my hair . 
if i would have been smart ,  i would have sent it back . 
that s the reason i no longer purchase this item . 
this soap smells like vinyl mixed with grandma s perfume . 
we have num_num dogs and so do our neighbors . 
i put it in the central area near where the male hangs out . 
what a bust !  each one i ve tried have produced similar results . 
absolutely the worst game in the excellent quakes . 
imho , these speakers deliver muddy sound throughout the entire frequency spectrum . 
now ,  i ll only buy when i can get them under $
each of the accessories has two little holes in them . 
i suggest not to use them with high quality watches . 
there is nothing about this product which warrants that price tag . 
the only thing it controlled was my hot flashes . 
there s so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones . 
i think this is one product you can skip .
