i roll out the crust to the right size . 
very well made and does a excellent job . 
i d give it num_extend stars if i could . 
check out the case for $ on verizon webiste . 
this machine should meet the expectations of coffee addicts on a budget . 
what a great iphone carry case for the price . 
i like the stainless and the simple design . 
 perhaps i ll even try the popcorn popping feature now !   . 
i would buy these again if i could get them for num_num again . 
these screen protectors have saved my phone numerous times . 
and my brother loves his phone and case . 
i have purchased six of these in the past year . 
i recommend it to anyone who has an iphone . 
the kuchenprofi emblem is stamped on one side of the flat hinge . 
and it can keep drinks hot for more than three hours . 
i haven t asked her much more than that . 
it keeps things hot ,  or cool ,  for hours and hours . 
this is where you often run into issues with other devices . 
our fiesta leaves the  power port  powered on all the time . 
it gets really hot ,  and the plastic top will become pliable . 
i was impressed and it was so pretty . 
this is my second anker battery because they are that impressive . 
wanted one off these for years got one . 
 generally ,  cleanup is the weak point of most kitchen gadgets . 
the product was delivered on the agreed date . 
i just wish there was a plug i for my iphone . 
but this charger is just too easy to carry about and too effective . 
just cool it down and hit the reset button . 
i have also canned meatballs with mushroom sauce and others with tomato sauce . 
i really like that i can rinse quinoa without the grains slipping through . 
although the microphone extends as a boom ,  i never use it extended . 
fits the phone well and protects it even if you drop the phone . 
the only complaint i have is that is takes  forever  to boil . 
i saw this and thought  what the heck  ?  . 
and why not when it s this easy !  pancakes ,  schmancakes . 
a very high quality machine that produces consistent results . 
i bought these ,  because it was a num_num pack combo . 
no tools required and i only needed help to place them . 
anything larger than lemons and limes ,  would be too large . 
cleans up easily  most parts go in the dishwasher  . 
have had no issues with this skillet and meat cooks well on it . 
i absolutely love this case for my iphone num_extend
another claim is that high rpm juicers heat your juice ,  destroying nutrients . 
the sound is similar from the wired ones in the phone s pakage . 
they continually season ,  and the food becomes richer tasting because of it . 
seems to be of good construction and never slips off the can . 
other than that it is a good product . 
so i took a chance and bought it . 
i bought this after using my lodge grill pan to make hamburgers . 
the case is exactly as described and i love it . 
i am always dropping my phone ,  so i wanted something durable . 
i use it to bake pizza ,  bread and biscuits . 
we are huge cooks and this product exceeded our expectation . 
it s definitely worth it to buy before you break it . 
they are also easy to clean and store well . 
time will tell ,  but till then ,  i m happy !  . 
will report back on the battery in a week or so . 
the most impressive part of this skin was the packaging . 
it does increase the sound quality of my iphone . 
for the cost i will continue buying these for housewarmings . 
works ok by itself but works much better with a line booster . 
the best feature is the flip function of the extension . 
use whatever size you need for the biscuits you want to make . 
with a little salt for flavor ,  you have a healthy snack . 
as an italian i use a lot of garlic . 
i have been ordering and using this for years . 
this is the second battery i have ordered . 
like i said though ,  perfect for game hens . 
i have owned a first gen jawbone and the jawbone ii as well . 
i have used cast iron for years and love it . 
i am num_num and have had numerous toasters in my lifetime . 
they save a lot of scratching and drops . 
they don t really tear up when you dispose them . 
motorola droid can even replace notebook computer for most things . 
i have only one regret ,  i should have bought seven . 
and since they are glass ,  they cleanup very easy . 
usually bakers only use cookie cutters at christmas . 
easy to remove and doesn t block the phone openings . 
the design is so classic ,  so simple and yet so elegant . 
so for the price and speed ,  it is an excellent buy . 
coffee french press a few months ago and its handle already came off . 
i like this !  cleans and does not damage skin . 
otherwise ,  it is just as good as the one pictured . 
i might have to order another one as a back up . 
washes easily under the faucet ,  air dries fine . 
some of them are not usable from being stretched out though . 
that said ,  it works ,  does the job well . 
i tried my solitaire app and it looked great . 
it s easy to use and cleaning it by hand is very easy . 
it couldn t be easier ,  just add olive oil and pump . 
the best cookie press you can buy for the price . 
i will be ordering some other sizes as well . 
we use our press pot num_num times a week . 
other than that ,  great product i d purchase again . 
this can opener took a bit for me to get the hang of . 
don t let water get into the handle ,  which contains the motor . 
yes there will be grounds not trapped by the filter . 
maybe i ll round my collection off at about num_extend
the carafe does keep the liquid hot for num_num hours as advertised . 
is the extra work worth it ?  i m still undecided . 
it is more of a  personal space  application if you will . 
i have been using this for a while now with great results . 
i ordered the  plus  but received the the one without + . 
it has held up well scraping my griddle clean after use too . 
i don t mean just good ,  i mean incredible . 
worth it for sure ,  half the price as the others available . 
this thing has been a great item to have in the kitchen . 
keep the inside of my microwave looking new . 
two plastic latches securely lock the blade when you close the num_extend
no where does it say it is bulk packaging or retail packaging . 
for the price ,  it is hard to beat . 
this is a beautiful and solid mortar and pestle . 
for the money ,  it s a great little meat grinder . 
i read about the trudeau press which was reviewed in a cooking magazine . 
take one of the filters and fold it in half . 
i do wish they were available with the blue lids though . 
far better than past kettles that cost more . 
i just don t understand any complaints about this great deal . 
much better then using two teaspoons like i used to do !  . 
that connects the trigger mechanism to the solution release . 
great priced and a great buy for sure . 
i coarsely ground a handful of peanuts  couple t  for garnish . 
this one is easy to read and works well . 
the other one is useful also ,  but not essential . 
the handle is very comfortable for long use . 
for now gets num_num stars from me overall . 
this norpro is the easiest most consistent press that i have used . 
it works on any size pan ,  big and small . 
i ve been using this juicer for two weeks now . 
don t act like you paid $ for the product . 
i have been using this product for many years . 
unfortunately ,  you cant just update the firmware yourself . 
but i seldom use a regular board for other than that . 
after num_num months of use ,  the battery still performance well . 
this is a nice way to store those really sharp food processor blades . 
our users like that they are compact and easy to carry when traveling . 
she is a large volume cell user and she has had no complaints . 
i do not know about any differences in reliability . 
i got it for $ with no box or instructions or mop heads . 
the instructions say to allow the battery to charge overnight . 
just letting you know from personal experience ,  and clumsiness . 
it s attractive and makes coffee for num_num pretty quickly . 
i have several victorinox knives ,  including num_extend chef s knife . 
i ve had my pans for years and just keep adding newer sizes . 
it is a bit noisy ,  but what vacuum cleaner isn t . 
such things have happened to my family members twice now . 
why this is lacking is incomprehensible to me . 
so ,  make sure that you don t get it wet while cooking . 
i love this cover !  fits my evo num_extend perfectly . 
i regret not cooking with cast iron sooner . 
the coffee produced is just fine  if you grind it properly  . 
with normal use it will be around for a long time . 
the edges ,  after not too much use ,  began to fray . 
i didn t see anyone else say anything about this problem . 
i bought these to make little treats for my dogs . 
anyone who thinks there is something wrong with it must be kidding . 
i throw oranges in because it is easier than the regular citrus juicer . 
this is the third one we have purchased . 
now i wouldn t want to be without it . 
now i can go num_num to num_num days between charges with normal use . 
if i feel like splurging ,  i add extra oil . 
i figured it would be the same thing next time . 
black of course with a chrome bezel around the front . 
sometimes it is hard to have your button press register . 
don t expect to lay in bed with them ,  period . 
i ve had my kitchenaid mixer for num_num years . 
but it really comes down to the diameter of your headphone s jack . 
i would not buy more simply because of that . 
my blackberry bold num_num did it on all num_num models i had . 
i believe the ota update is still due in a week or so . 
easy to install ,  durable materials and not too bulky . 
i use it a lot to make home made dressing . 
i ve used it for a multitude of applications . 
this is really annoying because other than that they still work great . 
these air poppers have been kicking around for decades . 
it won t say the name of the person on caller id however . 
the price is excellent . for that i gave them num_num stars . 
you can t beat a slice of fresh ,  warm bread with butter . 
you can use them and not have to worry about them . 
the cuts are nice and clean as is the hardwood . 
no problem folding it in half or releasing it from the pan . 
i use this to calibrate all of my other thermometers . 
this is a sturdy excellent quality spoon rest . 
my lid works fine so i ve been happy with my jar . 
protected my phone from scratches when it fell off of the couch . 
well ,  i use all of them all the time . 
num_num quart is the perfect size for beans and lintels . 
as always fiestaware is good quality and consistent from item to item . 
it will look funny num_num years from now when the lights are extinguished . 
always worth the little extra money to get one of these . 
it is even nicer than the picture and looks lovely on the table . 
i used it the next day to make our thanksgiving turkey . 
at last a really useful and thoughtful product . 
this machine cannot support bread making for very long . 
but for smoothies and mixed drinks it was perfect and durable !  . 
i thought this was too good to be true . 
that s just fine with me ,  the flavor is best this way . 
my wife and i cook a lot and use these constantly . 
this looks just like the old one but is better . 
easy clean up and the cord still retracts . 
i purchased it to replace a larger ,  bulkier spinner i had . 
the keyboard is just the right size and easy to press the keys . 
clean up is simple ,  just wipe the grill surface . 
i would really recommend buying a glove to go with it . 
i had no problem getting the cake out of the pan either . 
the one small caveat is that it can break . 
the fit is perfect ,  and it is easy to put on . 
i will probably buy a smaller one because it is just me . 
and the quantity was great if you mess up a lot . 
they look like china and make a very nice table setting . 
i have small hands and arthritis in my fingers and wrists . 
the kids will love it and it makes the house smell good . 
i got it here at amazon for $
i figured there must be some sort of hitch . 
same quality ,  same simple switch interface ,  nothing fancy . 
i am thoroughly impressed with the sound quality on every level . 
be careful; the cheap immitation ones are awful . 
sounds better when she calls than the old one this replaced . 
i love the clock and the display with it turned sideways . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
i never thought much about my knives since i was a casual cook . 
however ,  i wanted something for extended use on long trips . 
it also works in a pantech phone that we have . 
num_num months was well worth the price i paid . 
impressive . i would not hesitate to recommend this headset . 
this grinds coffee to any size grind you want . 
battery life has been excellent and the range is unbelievable . 
this unit burns clean with no smell or fumes . 
this is by far the best iphone charger i have ever used . 
the difficult part of cleaning starts after you remove the grinding wheel . 
i love the fact that it is metal and not that junky plastic . 
no waiting for ka to send you a new piece . 
now i see what the previous reviewers were talking about . 
i was unsure what to get when i shopped for this . 
num_num oz ?  are you kidding ?  it s barely a mug full . 
it works effectively and i have had it for about num_num years . 
then i unplugged it and watched the signal degrade . 
it really does work super good ,  shipping fast . 
this strainer is larger with bigger holes and does a better job . 
so the vegetables come out a little on the short side . 
it seemed like a nice assortment of colors . 
neat rack that looks good in a small open kitchen . 
forget about those suction crap holders they suck . 
i have used this and love the even browning and easy clean up . 
the call quality is truly second to none . 
network data on ,  screen is at automatic and bluetooth on . 
i was apprehensive about the application ,  but it really was simple . 
i thought i would give it a try . 
it s convenient enough that we whip it out frequently . 
you can use it with or without butter . 
on the whole it s a perfectly good set of measuring cups . 
i can access the touch screen through the plastic protector . 
may order another size to go with it . 
it averages making num_num pots a day and has performed well . 
induction and sunpentown  also a favorite quality item  . 
however ,  i gave this machine a chance and it did wonders . 
sound quality is excellent and will also depend on carrier reception . 
it should come by default with the phone . 
am expecting that this kitchen tool will give many years of service . 
wilton has the best color selection and this combination of colors were wonderful . 
it s not too expensive and makes a really good gift . 
laundry room items should be more sturdy ,  imo . 
i ll give it a scrub monthly ,  just because . 
she says this one has a better sound . 
out of all the cases that i bought this is my favorite . 
just skip all the others and get this one . 
i bought num_num of these to put under my kitchen sink . 
it s a very minor issue ,  but something to keep in mind . 
the baratza maestro has been upgraded and is not the old solis maestro . 
discs have a solid weighted feel to them . 
you will not be disappointed with this product at all !  !  . 
based on comments ,  i have decided to order one . 
obviously this person has no clue how rapid charging lithium batteries work . 
then just oil the inside base lightly before each use . 
i wish i had room for one more . 
this is one of the best kitchen items i ve bought . 
who needs an extra gadget to keep in your drawers ?  come on . 
this significantly reduces the  stale air  in my apartment . 
i ve used it often and have had delicious popcorn each time . 
this is a nice size for the smaller cooking jobs in the kitchen . 
don t get me wrong ,  the wagner ware product is nice . 
this means my phone s battery stinks while i m driving . 
for a party ,  you might want to order more than one box . 
mine quit again so now to order another one . 
the prep for these pitchers is more than i thought but easy . 
i wanted another chef knife and wanted to try an num_num inch . 
got these headphones so i didn t have to deal with cables again . 
most reviewers here say to use coarse ground coffee . 
i bought it because i thought it looked pretty . 
especially when trying to used the french fry or julienne blades . 
you can t find these huge tips at a regular store . 
easy to blend ,  easy to clean ,  only one dish . 
i like the patina that is forming on the handle . 
i was suprised at some reviewers saying these will bend . 
one can opener malfunctioned and i called the office which immediately replaced it . 
it is really easy and doesn t take much pressure . 
i also viewed a movie via head set and sounds amazing . 
coming from a blackberry ,  there was a learning curve . 
worth the investment to have a great ,  long lasting ,  dependable product . 
works like it should and you cant beat the price . 
it makes waffles and it does a good job of it . 
great job and well worth the small amount of $
the knurling on the back is not deep enough to be effective . 
this one is scary but it happened to me . 
i have one of these and i got another for my dd . 
i m hoping maybe its just a bad battery . 
it has a lot of surface area for scraping or gathering chopped foods . 
the flimsy plastic hose and wand make it feel fragile . 
i ve found that local sim cards have better rates . 
the num_num just blows the voyager pro+ away in terms of volume . 
she really loves to interact with the screen . 
i have tried the romertopf but it s too porous . 
i just for a new phone and had an extra battery . 
nice size veggie brush with a handle that is easy to grip . 
it s metal and just kind of sits above the drain . 
the bags are murder to install in the cleaner . 
great for phone repair or and small electronics . 
otterbox has one of the best cases out there . 
cleaner stores easily in handle  helps keep it from getting num_extend
i look forward to using this for years to come . 
since we have had good luck with it ,  i would recommend it . 
i use this tool a lot and i love it . 
the warranty is also only one year vs . 
the chicago metallic set is significantly heavier ,  which shows its strength . 
if you can a lot of food ,  these are a must have . 
if you add the toppers ,  then they ll stay even more insulated . 
i got it to use with my droid x in a protective case . 
it has a nice ,  slightly rubbery feel to it . 
recently it was a wedding and we wanted to take some pictures . 
i purchased this to hold two rechargable yard tools . 
perfect for candy making ,  as again ,  nothing sticks . 
i even  cut  canadian bacon in the pan ,  no problems at all . 
it is quick ,  simple ,  clean and works well . 
the battery arrived sooner than expected and in new packaging . 
has worked without fail now for over num_num years . 
it really comes in handy when i make caramel . 
the paired device has to disconnect before another device can use it . 
i ve been using it for several weeks now . 
i highly reccommend this item for iphone num_extend users . 
the next day i placed it in my phone at num_extend
the num_extend quart size is perfect for single meals . 
i only rate it four stars because of the slippery surface . 
it looks spectacular with just a little powdered sugar dusted over the details . 
this pizza pan seemed like a good option . 
they are made of high quality materials and not  flimsy  at all . 
it did not stain with dough ,  rolling ,  soaps ,  etc . 
i may look into calling the company and asking about replacing the bakelite . 
they are the perfect size for venting steam and decorating . 
voice answering ,  call rejection ,  and placing a call . 
the jabra extreme had the best ability to stay on your ear . 
works as well as zagg shields for about $ less . 
it only removes a little metal but not too much . 
but the true reason i got it is for the extra juice . 
all the bowls are good for dry storage ,  as well . 
then it all comes apart for easy storing . 
if you bake  ,  you need these  !  . 
the shape lets you easily hold it to mix . 
the handle has a great weight and the spatula is a great size . 
would buy again and have recommended to friends . 
can be difficult to attach to a vent . 
it also has a place to hang it from a lanyard ,  too . 
i used it twice and it performed well . 
its a great product and will protect your phone . 
i opened it up and it was beautiful . 
works well removing water after rinsing salad ingredients and is quality made . 
it is nice having the ability to change out the skins . 
it works really well and i would buy otterbox again . 
i bought this with wilson s power boost cradle . 
we use our brita pitcher all day long . 
i personally have an iphone num_extend and my wife as an iphone num_extend
nice and heavy being cast iron and very easy to clean . 
insert back into the oven and cook for num_num more minutes . 
it works perfectly from the get go and sounds fabulous . 
i really like this board and the size of it . 
not as impressive on clothes but definitely helps . 
the blade has plastic tabs in the bottom which hold it in place . 
i will never go back to stupid drip machines . 
this was the first time i ever used pie weights . 
she shows everyone !  it s cute !  they look great !  . 
it cut the ham very nice and thin slices . 
this is a beautiful purple case ,  i love it !  !  . 
good set ,  and i haven t come across any major negative aspects . 
the cooling rack is a great solution to the problem . 
the box is most beautifull one  the best design you can get  . 
this works great for citrus peels and ginger . 
i get fast ,  easy to use french fry cutter . 
it has been in the phone for several months now without any issues . 
my only complaint is the lack of color selection . 
blade is very flexible ,  and goes through everything like soft butter . 
or let it soak for hours in the sink . 
i got mine last year when it was around num_num bucks . 
overall it is a solid case and worth the buy . 
perfect fit into headphone jack and recharging slot . 
so i knew we didn t want that to happen . 
i only have one complaint about this device . 
the shipping is always on time and the product is always great . 
once in operation ,  it seems to keep going without additional assistance . 
this fits my samsung galaxy num_extend very well . 
 :   maybe a bit  trendy and hipster  but who cares . 
i can do more at a time and clean up is quick . 
of course most people are not clumsy ,  they are simply too fast . 
i am so thrilled to have these tools now . 
the wheels roll well on any indoor surface . 
it was difficult ,  tough to handle and my cake layer almost broke . 
i ended up using it more than i thought . 
this is the best kitchen trash can we have ever owned . 
scratches easily ,  but does what it is intended to do . 
i am able to hear sound and use the microphone . 
for the money the perfect value in its class . 
this one should last for a long ,  long time . 
she has made a life long loyal customer in me . 
i paid $ for that one and the drive was plastic . 
i ordered this presto pressure cooker as a replacement . 
this little thing works great ,  providing a lot of suction . 
the sound from bass to highs is very good to my aging ears . 
a screwdriver is recommended but not really necessary . 
this is a beautiful and classic addition to a cooks kitchen . 
i would tell anyone looking for storage that this is a great solution . 
i use it often for numerous tasks in the kitchen . 
handle is large and comfortable ,  provides good leverage . 
the probe is curved for easy manipulating and num_extend
the coffee stays hot; never burned or bitter . 
i had num_extend handy which fits perfectly with these headphones . 
overall i am thoroughly impressed with this phone . 
soft ,  resists dirt and grime ,  tactile ,  and visually pleasing . 
nothing like popcorn in the evening when you just want a little something . 
i am not willing to spend much more than what these  phones cost . 
hit  bluetooth  to initiate a search and it will find the jabra extreme . 
i ordered this knife after using the num_extend chef s knife . 
only time will tell if it will last . 
it wont work on the iphone num_extend or any ipods . 
i kept the stock battery and keep all three in rotation . 
i guess the cord might be num_extend in length . 
is nice and small and lasts slightly longer then the stock battery . 
i was pleased with this product and would use it again . 
i bought this grinder on january num_extend num_extend
but i was determined ,  so i kept going . 
steamer did not do anything for the grout . floors . 
i m italian and i can confirm that this machine works fine . 
ok .  .  . my husband and i got married on the spur . 
this one is just as good as the others . 
most are either num_num star or num_num star . 
these bowls are tough and ready to do whatever you need . 
i think it looks ok ,  but not great . 
so does the family bakery with a scrub brush and hot hot water . 
i only charge it once a month or more . 
at the apple store you pay $ for this . 
this is a great tool to have in the kitchen . 
also i picked up the accessory attachment for mason jars . 
the oxo s handles are the same length as my plastic measuring cups . 
i use them as a nonstick surface for my bread to rise on . 
we live in an appartment building ,  in a noisy part of nyc . 
the oxo style handle certainly makes it easier and more comfortable to use . 
yuck !  i had to discard the whole bag . 
i gave this as a gift to my sister . 
lol i found that the cheaper brands are not as perfectly shaped . 
the cups all stack inside each other and attach to a large hook . 
this set is a good price for a basic set of paring knives . 
i m tempted to get a smaller and easier to use one . 
the definition of good flatware is that it has some heft . 
fit to the ear is very soft and secure . 
this is a great case and found it here for a great price . 
if not ,  then take the word of a coffee fanatic . 
then i cooked some chopped meat in it and the results were wonderful . 
it is certainly easier than attaching the manual machine to the counter . 
overall a great product that i would recommend . 
they arrived very quickly and i must say that i am totally pleased . 
i can go into another building nearby and still have a connection . 
tight integration with google voice  you do not need paid text num_extend
i bought this product for my sons  phone . 
the variety of sizes in the set is great . 
the media link is automatic and does not need to be messed with . 
i have moved to cast iron or glass . 
she loves it and i would recommend it . 
we find its is better suited for medium to small lemons . 
so she is very please with her gift . 
much rather have a scratched case than phone . 
but if you like sparkly color then they are for you !  . 
i ve ordered hard plastic cases before and they just seem too slippery . 
saw this device on the pbs martha stewart cooking school program . 
he said it worked fine and he likes it . 
this is a great lod for iphone num_extend and fioo num_extend
the cut fits the iphone num_extend and came with no issues . 
sometimes i put fish in the vegetables in the top . 
i tried the splatter guard over pan ,  but not good . 
most of our car chargers are abused so they don t last long . 
i just hope it lasts longer than my other ones . 
i wouldn t use my big oven without it . 
i still have mine in place after num_num days . 
you can nuke them but they loose their crispness . 
installation was simple and the cloth helps keep the screen from smudges . 
i still recommend the product and cellular connection . 
was in need of a larger cutting board for larger cutting jobs . 
the first has a boxwave label and it works fine . 
the overall performance and the voice assist feature work very well . 
they came just like they said they would and in great shape . 
for the price im not complaining at all . 
has a cap on top to keep it clean and reduce humidity . 
i am ordering a num_extend one for my other car . 
i simply filled out the return form on amazon and they quickly responded . 
i just needed a solid phone that would withstand bumps and drops . 
the maker does not cut the segments up for num_extend
this one is nice and loud and very clear . 
well ,  maybe second to the all copper one . 
a sturdy unit that should work well with small loafs . 
the tray in the warmer does not come out . 
keep in mind that this device is essentially a speakerphone in the car . 
first ,  cut the plastic plug covering the usb port . 
the cut out handles make it easy to move from place to place . 
but that s small cheese when you take this device as a whole . 
this product was exactly what i was expecting . 
the ruler on the side is handy too . 
i am done in no time and have wonderful fluffy mashed potatoes . 
i enjoy not having to use paper filters that give a paper taste . 
this is a good all around cleaner for the price . 
web browsing works well although not as smooth as the num_extend
this gets a lot of use and has held up well . 
it can rotate num_num degrees around and can tilt back and forth . 
and that is exactly how to use this device . 
the fit is identical to the icon hero and hero hd . 
my wife bought one of these ,  and i was skeptical . 
it is a replacement for my original that quite working . 
for slicing veggies or anythng with a crust there is no equal . 
you will need tools ,  so i suggest you get one with tools . 
just beware of considering the dimensions before ordering . 
so this case let s the iphone be all those things . 
i also read some other reviews and some product features on tv . 
this is a must have when working with fondant or gum paste . 
i have had an excellent experience with this headset . 
i used my paddle so much that it was losing its plastic coating . 
just remember that its frustrating to have to cut little clips so . 
i really like knowing that i finally have a cast iron skillet . 
it has done it s job well for us . 
 it s actually one cable with two adapters that plug into the end . 
the phone is exposed to dust ,  mud and rain .

it has worked perfect out the box and makes great coffee . 
i emailed the company to find out if i was using it right . 
can t have too many of these usb cables for your phone . 
there s nothing not to love about this skillet .

for stirring but edge can slide under food ,  too .

i am confident these breadboxes will last long enough to become family heirlooms . 
the price is surprisingly low for how nice they are . 
shun provides lifetime free sharpening for these knives ,  including return postage . 
i bought this mixing bowl to use for making popcorn . 
the peel off rear cover is especially flimsy feeling . 
i bought this with the num_num for num_num promotion . 
ive made tarts before and had to press them out by hand . 
works great as a headset for my computer . 
what s not to like ?  no more shredded knuckles .

i would definetly order another product like this . 
i needed an apple corer to dehydrate apples into apple chips . 
a little bit of flour goes a long way with this device . 
it always works ,  very sturdy and easy to wipe down . 
i don t have a lot of experience with grinders . 
the controls are conveniently placed and work great . 
pyrex has replaced all the plastic trash we used to store food in .

i ve been spoiled by my other vacs which had them . 
i bought this pitcher to replace one just like it . 
worked great on my phone while it was on . 
i like the fact i can charge more than one device with it . 
if you want to use the smaller num_num oz . 
its simple and very effective !  cleanup is basically nothing . 
the sharpness of this knife is out of the box . 
its comfortable and much better than having my ipod in my pocket etc . 
i love to make dried fruit and turkey jerky .

i dont even care that the little bunny tail falls off frequently . 
we used it with our last turkey and it worked great . 
it s a workhorse that will only die if you mis treat it . 
it makes enough bread for num_num people at a time .

it s really all you will probably ever use .

these bags are great and very cute for favors . 
they re great filters; nice and sturdy ,  unbleached ,  work great . 
i don t feel compelled to turn to the mandoline as often . 
it heats up quickly and it cleans up in a flash . 
no strength or effort is required at all . 
does it wear the wood out a little bit ?  of course . 
i used it to take notes and review with my ipad . 
yay ,  there is and amazon carries these fido gaskets . 
it is easy to set up and clean ,  and works fairly quickly . 
plus ,  it is a little thicker that most other phones . 
of course you can just say  call  followed by the phone number . 
i can also see at a glance how much food is left . 
at the time this was the only case available for this phone . 
no problems with the suction cup on this one either . 
that one has a good battery but the design is a bit fragile . 
the color is like a clear brown color . 
this case has just the right amount of impact absorption . 
regarding the weight ,  the heavy weight is a good thing . 
it s sturdy and easy to manage ,  easy to clean . 
always goes on smooth and last a really long time . 
i really do like how small and compact it is for travel . 
i look forward to many years of usage . 
thank you so much for selling this item . 
works well on both hardwood and short carpeting . 
the rotini attachment ,  however ,  worked a whole lot better . 
this charger works great with any phone that uses micro usb port . 
i moved from the jabra num_extend to the num_extend and really like the num_extend
i have no problem hearing them while on the road . 
quality is still there ,  but its pretty slipery . 
i suggest it for anyone who has a kindle fire . 
a roller can be operated with one hand . 
i still use the case to this day . 
i can rub my finger against it and not get cut . 
it keeps liquids warm without being on direct heat . 
i must say the cake could not have turned out better . 
so yeah ,  i think the warping might actually be my own fault . 
we have gotten tons of compliments on them . 
this was a pretty good price for a replacement battery for my convoy . 
we barely use our oven anymore because of this handy machine . 
i use it on my desk at work . 
they fit perfectly and do a super job of protecting the phones . 
it s slightly expensive for what you get ,  but it works . 
after almost num_num years of use ,  i m now finally selling it . 
they keep everything safe ,  and prevent chipping and cracking . 
nothing special ,  but these jars serve their purpose well . 
i use these to transport iced coffee every day . 
i can t speak for how they build them today . 
i ve been trying to use less plastic and purchased these containers . 
it did not work with my blackberry and i forgot all about it . 
there are just many uses for these tall ,  deep bowls . 
it provides good protection for the phone without adding too much bulk . 
many online forums and review sites have reviewed and vouch for their products . 
the case does not make the phone bulky . 
i bought this for my mom almost num_num years ago . 
the muffins were baked through in the allotted time . 
i got a really good deal on a food saver . 
tamp the grinds down g e n t l y . 
well ,  it came and i love the size !  it s perfect . 
their canisters don t last more than a month . 
it was too short for average amounts of mashed root veggies . 
i use num_num batteries with my samsung sidekick . 
received product on time and packaged as promised . 
no problems with charging and was less $ to replace . 
as it got full i needed more sheets . 
i bought this phone for my wife and she loves it . 
this was wrapped very well and delivered intact . 
this item is what would be expected ,  plugs nicely ,  etc . 
i love coffee in the morning and fresh coffee is great . 
for the past few months we ve been making home made pizza . 
there is a store near me in so . 
serves the purpose ,  but the batteries are not that good . 
i guess that seidio s mah s are stronger than the competitors . 
it s high quality stainless and should last for years . 
i also really like the fact that it has num_num different sizes vs . 
i really like this machine and what a great price . 
less than $ for a num_num foot cable . 
there is a bit of prep work ,  but it is worth it . 
it really is indispensable and i should probably order another one right now . 
i can t say much more than he is happy with the purchase . 
like other reviewers ,  i also bought this pan for soap making . 
it tastes fine the way it comes out . 
it s a huge improvement over the floor type shoe racks . 
very easy to find in a big purse . 
the exterior and interior enamel coating is very durable and easy to clean . 
there really weren t any when i put mine on . 
choose this model because of the mobility and larger capacity reservoir . 
i have them in the nylon tips and metal . 
small and compact without having a tangled mess to deal with . 
so i vacuum more frequent because of the conveniency . 
i love this phone ,  it s perfect for me . 
i ordered the seidio num_num mah and i m using it right now . 
it has a nice hand grip ,  not slippery . 
she s had it for about num_num months now . 
this west bend one s a breeze to use and clean . 
that is ,  it s performance is substantially less good on larger devices . 
i have been using cast iron pans for a long time . 
it is solid black and is fairly flat as pictured . 
it is just the thing for weak hands . 
case protects well and the color is awesome nice . 
i have several and this one fits right in with the others . 
a big pain to put on as well as most screen protectors are . 
the carafe drips all over when you pour . i have never experienced num_extend
i thank you and my fingers thank you . 
i would probably get a bumper if i had to do again . 
more sizes than most sets i looked at . 
ive had this pan for a long time now . 
she s quite a baker and uses them regularly . 
for like num_extend a apiece they are great extra covers to have . 
i bought this to replace my cuisinart griddler . 
evidently ,  durability improvements have been made in the model . 
my phone remained the same ,  it works perfectly . 
the fit all around is very good ,  but not excellent . 
makes a good filter if yo use a drip method . 
now i need to get some bubble bath supplies . 
the bread comes out great and the pizza dough is awesome . 
i ve cut my own fries by hand all of my num_extend years . 
first one was used for work black  and has taken much abuse . 
also ,  the warm glow radiating makes me feel like it s sunshine . 
great taste ,  will not go back to store bought now . 
i looked around a bit before i chose this brand of pan . 
it is light enough to leave in place all day long . 
it is bright and great to use for spring . 
plus the hoses could be like wrestling a boa constrictor . 
keep in mind i leave my car in num_num degree weather every day . 
i believe that it will do the same for you . 
i am hoping for the same with this one . 
the first one looked so good that i bought a second . 
in this case ,  i wanted to make some kimchi and saurkraut . 
and the six foot cord makes it better than the original  !  . 
this one does not have the light on unless you are charging . 
the price was great and i already used it for an event . 
i like this for toast when guests are over for breakfast or brunch . 
be sure you purchase from amazon . com llc or another authorized dealer . 
the galaxy note num_extend battery longevity is ridonculously good . 
i only buy lodge when it comes to cast iron . 
it has a couple games included and a few choices for ring tones . 
i just got back to canning since retirement . 
with this thing you will rip through the job in seconds . 
to clean up bottom just wipe the oil out . 
it comes with a gold tone filter and a water filter . 
i got it because my phone kept shutting off . 
this is my second pruchase of this model of knife sharpner . 
in a pinch you can use standard aa batteries . 
wish i had purchased it years ago .  .  .  . highly recommend . 
i haven t experienced the start up issues others have . 
i am thinking of buying more for gifts . 
it has a nice ammount of bass ,  wonderful for music . 
i also received a samsung stratosphere android cell phone . 
i couls see passing this thing down many generations . 
very nice charger ,  charge very fast matching with wall charger . 
the two things i like about this were its stability and safety . 
no harder to use than regular manual openers . 
the second one i bought sounds num_num or num_num percent num_extend
periwinkle and yellow are the colours of this server that we have . 
it is my second bluetooth and the fit is great . 
all the functions advertised works and works seamlessly with my motorola droid x . 
we bake our steak fries with this too . 
this is really annoying because other than that they still work great . 
the package and the battery are designed in an almost applesque manner . 
i agree with other reviews about the very short cord . 
so i returned it and got the razr . 
i ve now owned this kettle for at least num_num years . 
we use them as steak knives but also to chop veggies or else . 
it was ready to go before i was . 
i use it with olive oil and it gives a real mist . 
it s of great quality and pricing was excellent . 
first the picture does not look at all like what they send you . 
they work fine in the microwave and dishwasher too . 
mculloch was an american owned company ,  but is now owned by taiwan . 
but these totally bamboo twist chopsticks were very nearly perfect . 
it is super cute and i always get compliments on my case . 
good for small batches ,  not as good for larger ones . 
i have tried using vinegar ,  baking soda ,  etc . 
nothing sticks to it and it has very even heating . 
i have a cuisinart cake tester and this oxo . 
i would say it is perfect for one person to make treats . 
however ,  be prepared for a little clean up . 
so i wanted a white set with no decor on it . 
price point :  at $ i think it is a good num_extend
not to mention the protection and the price i got them for . 
i dont own that phone anymore but it works well with my iphone . 
a great buy for occasional use or for a dorm room . 
i love the fact the price was cheap . 
i took good care of it and it still worked only num_num year . 
they work great and haven t dulled at all . 
this oval roaster is perfect to make challan braided bread in . 
i live in an apartment rental that is tough on security deposits . 
for crisper pancakes ,  i use melted butter to coat each indentation . 
i just can t say enough good about it !  . 
did have some initial trouble feeling for the volume button . 
nice quality leather like material and fit great . 
so far this bottle isn t leaking around the cover . 
moshi moshi is apparently words japanese use to answer the phone . 
they were never as good as this pan . 
this one replaced a num_num year old sunbeam that finally wore out .

i think i cut the audio jack on the back . 
and i m sure it will hold just loads of dog poop . 
these glasses are not fancy ,  but can take a beating . 
purchased this rolling pin for my husband who makes pies . 
these work really great ,  but they are really wide . 
they re sturdy ,  nice looking and they nest well for easy storage . 
now this helps to put an end to that problem . 
the case still looks as good as new . 
it felt sturdy and well crafted when i picked it up originally . 
amazon has a short earbud for sale that is to short . 
this came first when i ordered my case as well as this . 
the aim simply won t log in  it s probably outdated  . 
this is a great bowl to have in my kitchen . 
a chemex ,  a glass tea kettle and good beans . 
i was quite surprised by how comfortable they are . 
i hesitated many years to buy cast iron . 
i use it every other day at least . 
it s hard to line the legs up properly . 
some reviewers have expressed both concerns and solutions about sanitation . 
they look decent on the cell phone ,  but forget much more . 
so humans and birds alike will love the ease of this . 
however ,  what is more valuable is otter box costumer service . 
this case was very inexpensive and shipping was fast . 
unfortunately the weather has not warranted putting ice outside yet . 
it works well for what it is ,  a snack maker . 
each case keeps cosmetic appearance for at least num_num months . 
at last i found a quality pot spoon like i remember from childhood . 
that was the first thing we tested when we got our discovery . 
you really can t go wrong with this vac !  . 
i paid $ a few weeks ago ,  it s now up to $
it does come with a belt clip which is optional to put on . 
it charges my phone and fits the usb ports nicely . 
mission accomplished :  we re both very happy with our purchase . 
a well made product in both function and finish . 
no dough hook hole in the final product this way . 
i was at a restaraunt and used a similiar glass and loved it . 
i only wish i had gotten one sooner !  . 
he said it fits well on his phone and he liked the colors . 
treat yourself to a basic tool that doesn t feel basic at all . 
i like the back and forth mechanism on this . 
this is the best case you could possibly buy for your iphone . 
i use the tiny ones to carry vitamins when i travel . 
thorough rubbing with a paper towel can clean the filter . 
it will make a beautiful addition to any dessert table . 
i would have done this anyways ,  but i find the practice deceptive . 
i have been using the same tiny food processor for num_num years . 
anyway it fits and works like it should . 
its small size is too convenient to complain . 
so far i have ground peppercorns ,  parsley and coarse salt . 
the oxo good grips flour sifter is recommeded for most people . 
this cover fits my htc inspire num_extend perfectly . 
hoping to nab a bundt pan at a good price soon !  . 
this does a great job on my carpets and on my hardwood floors . 
the delivery was very prompt and the packaging was excellent with no damages . 
it s a pretty tough rubber and doesn t fall off whatsoever . 
nothing fancy ,  just well priced and well made .

i ve had this pan  as well as the num_num qt . 
as you can see it definitely has the visual appeal . 
i ve used it exclusively for deep fat frying . 
this nonstick adjustable roast rack works perfect in my roasting pan . 
i bought these as they didn t require liquid and had good ratings .

i also have no issues with the screen lock during calls . 
this is the perfect keeper for my motorola command bluetooth headset . 
i have made everything from soup to roast and have never been disappointed .

besides ,  it conveys the authenticity of the folklore of the asian people . 
i bought these as a gift for my daughter in law for christmas . 
the bissel cleaning and stain solutions really do work outstandingly well . 
if you do ,  making this pin fit is simple . 
hamburgers ,  sausages and other red meats do well . 
i always store it without pressure so that it will last longer . 
this takes all the air out of the bottle and secures the cork . 
the back has the right cuts for camera and speaker so its perfect . 
it makes cleaning the leftover bits a breeze now . 
these are good if you don t need a long cable . 
this is a great machine which produces hot coffee ,  very quickly . 
i even make hash browned potatoes in this ring along with other things . 
then toss in the sauce and add cheese and toss again . 
i have ten of these bowls in my kitchen . 
discard the core or give it to our pet rabbit  minus seeds  . 
you don t want to open the oven to add water . 
the case might get a scratch or a lil dirty . 
viola !  done ! many other uses that have been mentioned previously . 
the pasta was too wet so we added a tbs . 
this is by far one of my favorite battery backups . 
this is an excellent and fast boiler that has some minor issues . 
it should be a little dry before the last rise . 
we use the otterbox defender series for all of our portable devices now . 
this one is very similar ,  but better ,  and works great . 
i love this set and definitely recommend them for their usefulness and quality . 
you can set the time for anything under num_num minutes . 
i am not going without one ever again . 
this is probably the best case you can buy for the price . 
not much to say other than it s long enough . 
given the price then listed at over $
it s effortless if you use an oscillator tool . 
i do not know what else you want it to do . 
it is a good heavy gauge stainless steel and heats quickly . 
what can i say its a tea kettle . 
this is a real deal on a great stockpot . 
the flavor is second to none and the pan are virtually indestructible . 
both pieces are of a very heavy and sturdy glass . 
the yogurt is creamy and delicious ,  and clean up is a snap . 
it takes num_num minutes top from prep to finish . 
even if it last half as long i will be thrilled . 
it took me almost an hour to scrub them off . 
it s so well made and feels really comfortable in my hand . 
these are sticks for making ice cream pops . 
i bought this pan several months ago and use alot . 
in my retirement i design foods for a small company i started . 
the knife is sharper than many mezzalunas and is well balanced . 
new filter will be order and we will be back in business . 
it causes absolutely no degradation in clarity or definition . 
more durable than the original ear hooks from samsung ,  which are crap . 
the cheese looks like little snow flakes are they fall to the ground . 
the motospeak i eneded up uninstalling because it was very wishy washy . 
the headset talks to you to coach you through pairing . 
zojirushi knows their cookers and this is as quality as they come . 
everything is moist and tasty and wonderfully textured . 
solid cable and long enough not to be next to the tv . 
 had to read some really fine print to find that little gem  . 
kudos to kitchen aid for standing behind it s customers . 
first ,  i went from premium ground coffee to grinding my own . 
its not uncomfortable but it could be better as well . 
i ve had them for num_num years ,  and i absolutely love them . 
they are rugged !  some aren t very comfortable though . 
also the rubber grip makes holding the pitcher comfortable and effortless . 
this is a very slim case and fits the phone perfectly . 
it requires a lot of work to assemble and clean . 
my husband received this knife as a christmas gift and is loving it . 
for the price ,  it really is designed very well . 
so far that s been true . i really like this thermometer . 
the protector does everything it says it will do . 
when the num_extend was announced i decided to go for it . 
of course ,  you can use it to peel things too . 
it made the best vanilla bean ice cream i have ever tasted . 
battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day . 
these are definitely worth the couple of bucks it takes to buy them . 
i will buy more of them for my friend . 
this works perfectly ,  right out of the box . 
these cutters are sturdy and durable; they do an excellent job . 
below are the num_num reasons why i chose this over the num_extend
the power pack num_num is small and light . 
this is the most essential gadget to my cooking . 
if you protect it ,  you wont regret getting it . 
i am ready to rock and roll this summer . 
any higher and it will pour out of the container . vi . 
the processor is not dual core ,  but it is super fast . 
they are glass of course ,  so they will break if mishandled . 
it cleans up beautifully and looks nice and shiny . 
there s no going back to manual for me !  . 
even the included recipe book offers a million options . 
these are great and i order them as needed . 
my sister got my mom a huge num_num pound mortadella for christmas . 
i ve owned this silverware for a year now . 
i use it for grilling hot dogs and sausages . 
it took me a few times to get used to this can opener . 
i have gotten multiple charges from the trent charger . 
overall i would say this is a good sharpener for this price . 
it made perfect slices and the amazon price was a bargaign . 
the picture looks like you are getting a privacy screen . 
the braun aquaexpress is easier to use and quieter . 
and it isn t cheap ,  it s just regular plastic . 
so ,  once the tricks are learned it was pretty good . 
we ve only used it twice ,  and both times it performed flawlessly . 
i purchased this about two years ago and it s held up fine . 
along with the weights i previously had ,  this makes quite enough . 
before we just threw the ring out since it was a huge pain . 
it holds my evo safely ,  looks nice and does the trick . 
for this price  ,  i would recommed it . 
it is a well built to protect a phone . 
it s classic design that s been around for years ,  no surprises . 
i returned at least num_num headsets until i came across this one . 
great all around lanyards for anything which needs to be keep close . 
and so it really creates a problem with plugging in the cord . 
i grew up ,  my parents used only a chemex pot . 
that does not mean we eat only hagen daas quality stuff  well . 
we have gone through one cheap vacuum after another . 
i looked at it like this : the num_num qt . 
it works as advertised even when our phones updated to ics . 
i love the ice cream this gadget makes . 
it s surprisingly light and works well other than the occasional disconnect . 
this thin rubber case is perfect for my use . 
great idea and i m mulling the idea of purchasing a couple more . 
and it s better than any knife i ve tried . 
not sure about using it on firmer raw veggies yet . 
the coffee press takes coffee to a different level of enjoyment . 
this item was recommended to me and i am pleased with its performance . 
this is a great way to protect your iphone screen . 
great for upholstery too . buy me i am worth the money . 
i use it at work to get up my tea water . 
purchased for swmbo ,  and she absolutely loves her cuisinart processor . 
it always have the air bubbles in them after putting it on . 
i do think ,  however ,  i will continue using this case . 
i haven t had this problem with any other headset . 
so far ,  i m not having any problems with it . 
it is fast ,  easy to use ,  and comfortable . 
i have always found amazonbasics items to be of great quality . 
i purchased this as a gift for a friend that lives in ny . 
and as usual it arrived promptly from amazon . com . 
the brushed chrome outside is easy to keep new looking as well . 
she is a fantastic cook  puts me to shame every time  . 
because i thought this would be incredibly difficult . 
no filling up each time ,  and the espresso tastes great . 
after repeated use in the microwave the lid expands . 
good for putting your hot coffee cup on a plastic tablecloth . 
handy size; rack can be used in either pan; great nonstick coating . 
i changed the ear clip and it still happens . 
i have a galaxy siii and it works great . 
this deep carpet cleaner is nothing new in my house . 
the controls are on the right ear side . 
this grill is great for hamburgers ,  chicken ,  hot dogs ,  etc . 
in short ,  buy num_num now ,  they are worth it . 
it is so good that i have purchased several as gifts . 
we don t even use our stove anymore since getting this . 
washable yet it stands over the mixer without being floppy . 
i holds good charge and does not overheat . 
it s great for bringing your coffee or tea to work . 
i got this as a gift for my cousin and she loves it . 
i bought a second steel bowl for convenience . 
love these when i want to smile ! highly recommended . jtg . 
i ve cleaned the unit once and it was a simple procedure . 
still not big enough for a htc thunderbolt . 
decent enough quality ,  i wash and dry by hand . 
this is a very good product for the price . 
what a bargain for the priceless feeling of security it gives me . 
but last fall i wanted some more and could not find these anywhere . 
the smaller attachments are conviently inside the top cover . 
i gave her the cover to keep it clean . 
wish it hard a sleeker design and extra ear gels with it . 
this is a good quality thick plastic and it has performed well . 
it is very sturdy and very well made . 
its very pretty and compliments my phone really well . 
it has the largest  very adequate  camera opening i have seen for num_extend
she said they are nice and work well . 
this is just one of the many pieces i have ordered from amazon . 
fill kettle with at least twice the water needed to brew . 
in truth i like it much better than my mia parer . 
works fine for data and charging on kindle num_extend
this is great grill ,  like the other foreman grills . 
the item was shipped fast and came as described with no problems . 
if you used it ,  you know what i mean . 
i am so glad i bought this for her . 
what a joy !  good coffee and quickly made . 
the only accessory i needed to add was a case . 
if you cook ,  bbq ,  or anything like that ,  get one . 
it sounds funny when i use a metal   !   utensil . 
i m surprised at all the reviews discussing  stains  on these knives . 
the magnets are quite large and have more strength than we expected . 
i did this after finding out how toxic teflon can be . 
the screen filter just lays inside and is not a tight fit . 
in particular ,  the earhooks pivot in one dimension only . 
i would like to buy another one for my holiday home in oregon . 
it has a heavy base ,  heats quickly and holds temperature well . 
i also loaded pictures from my computer to my phone . 
but for the price ,  so far i m satisfied . 
auto option works well and controls are user friendly . 
this headset is small ,  light and has good sound quality . 
prior to that i used the original verizon droid and the droid incredible . 
if this truly is the product pictured ,  it is the best . 
would like it to be easier to remove . 
we always use an exhaust fan while cooking . 
the magnetic flap holds the phone securely in all instances . 
getting rid of the fats is also a plus . 
so all in all this is a bargain and it works well . 
much heavier weight and higher quality than i anticipated . 
the bad reviews due to fake headphones are creating an incorrect rating . 
i have now since replaced my phone and don t need this charger . 
applications had to be reinstalled one by one . 
set of stylus came quite a bit earlier than estimated . 
i encourage you to try some of the dessert tortillas . 
it is espectacular for the touch electronics products . 
i bought this fan for the kids room . 
but other than that ,  this machine is a . 
drained water and placed couple of them in the ricer at a time . 
the bowl is easily cleaned and nothing sticks . 
bought this to supplant a smaller one with limited battery life . 
right ,  like it ll be deliver during the holidays . 
at these prices it makes it less expensive . 
i m particulary excited about being able to grind meats and make breads . 
worth the couple extra dollars from the cheaper ones around the net . 
it is big enough for measuring large quantities . 
this item works just fine on my verizon htc thunderbolt . 
this pizza pan is exactly what i was looking for . 
good advice for anyone who owns a bb . 
the professional series are durable and dishwasher safe . 
so i decided to get this . the back door sucks . 
sometimes i have to futze with it to get it started . 
but i saw these online and realized we could use them . 
it is far better than any paring knife or slicer i own . 
they are great when making a meal in the summer . 
i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys popcorn . 
had no issue once i started using my own cord s  though . 
protect your investment from those times you just cant  count on . 
i bought these protectors to protect my screen ,  they work just fine . 
i d strongly recommend this to any blackberry owner . 
i bought this and it worked great for a while . 
it makes great ice cream and is fun to make . 
so i save money both on initial purchase price and on monthly fee . 
i like it because of the size and the color . 
brings water to a steaming boil really quickly . 
my box shows the firmware at version num_extend
 no pun intended  this is a great pan . 
great quality and easy to install by yourself . 
i grind my own dehydrated peppers ,  and like to try different combinations . 
so far ,  two of my friends have ordered it . 
however ,  it doesn t add bulk like with the otterbox style cases . 
this machine i think sits right in the middle . 
i just put the meat on ,  and listen . 
the amazon photos of this doen t do it justice either . 
about the only use the range gets nowadays is to use the oven . 
the phone was brand new and worked great . 
there isn t much to say about this mitt except that it works . 
i also own a full set of wusthof kitchen knives . 
sometimes my baking recipe s would not come out as expected . 
all in all ,  a great product for the money . 
i bought this case for my verizon iphone num_num and it was great . 
a few small scratches ,  but they don t affect performance . 
i bought these after two sets of lg tones broke on me . 
the cord came when they said it would maybe earlier . 
i purchased this model after reading all of the positive reviews . 
it even works well when i was using it and riding my bike . 
plugs in and provides ample power for charging my droid . 
i have already bought two :  blue and purple . 
the original charger only charged half my battery over night . 
ground dried ancho or chipotle peppers add a bit more heat and flavor . 
and when they wear out ,  i ll just buy more . 
this would be about the num_extend bt headset i have owned . 
as a wood worker ,  drawing circles is a common problem . 
i have never tried it for making real donuts . 
i read the directions to the sharpener and began . 
despite the stickiness of the mix ,  the meatballs came out easily . 
it cleans easily and feels comfortable in my hand . 
over the past year i ve been quite satisfied with this opener . 
this was just what i thought i wanted ,  and it was great . 
we are a family of num_num and it s just perfect . 
if you want the best in customer service i highly recommend them . 
i was terrified of being stranded at night in this neighborhood . 
it took about fifteen minutes for me to get the entire phone covered . 
whenever she bakes german cakes here in the u . s . 
this granpappy fryer is exactly what i needed . 
usability of the commuter but with strength of the defender . 
i love the storage case that doubles as a charger . 
since these are not cut outs ,  they simply extend the buttons . 
i also used the other end makes the cakes look so good . 
num_num will perhaps charge your phone ,  but it s then entirely completed . 
this case provides for a slim ,  protective shell for your iphone num_extend
elegant container for sugar cubes to be serve with espresso  par example  . 
our house has wood  crown  moldings at the bottom of our cabinets . 
that makes it easier to get built up coffee grime out . 
otherwise ,  really ,  what more can you expect at any price ?  . 
this is the third blue tooth headset i ve owned . 
i m very satisfied with the way this peeler performs . 
like the way they detach from the ring . 
years ago my dad said this was the one brand to buy . 
returning to amazon ,  confident they ll send a properly marked set . 
it too is a fantastic pot for the price . 
it arrived with a few other items in a larger box . 
the different settings for toast and bagels is handy . 
it works well with cans of all sizes very small to very large . 
i wish i had bought two like i said . 
i have small ears so earbuds are difficult and uncomfortable . 
the one downside is they re a bit on the small size . 
have been using this unit for quite some time . 
this would be an excellent choice for an excellent price . 
have had one of these for a while . 
this is a worth while purchase for any  less than careful  iphone user . 
lets face it we all can t be great at everything . 
get out num_num pizzas ,  heat oven for first one . 
funny ,  i have never had a new one . 
it s exactly what i ve come to expect from the oxo line . 
if you re afraid of cast iron ,  don t be . 
this little unit works great for me ,  though it s not perfect . 
my wife wanted the big one so she can cook everything together . 
i a snap !  it came with some extra adhesive strips too . 
of the screen protectors out there i would definitely recommend theses . 
don t need a ladder anymore to change light pole lights . 
they are exactly as i d expected ,  and as described . 
they last reasonably well for the work they do . 
the droid x delivers in every other area . 
the microplane line of zesters and graters is worth every dime . 
the sound quality is great here with good bass . pairing was simple . 
it heats up fast and is the quietest kettle i ve ever used . 
calphalon makes amazing pans the quality is unsurpassed !  .

i used this grinder to grind up cooked chicken . 
the parts are solidly built and it is dishwasher safe . 
this is the second one i have purchased . 
i had the smaller num_num and it seemed to work . 
but the slices come out great and very even . 
still use it when the other phones go down . 
held up to making several hundred cookies right after it arrived . 
not this one  unless you still actually play cds  . 
it wipes clean with a dry paper towel . 
that being said ,  it works extremely well and maintains its blades nicely . 
both ends plug in smoothly and the charger works well . 
if you have an iphone ,  this accessory is a must have !  . 
second is it has the same size plug as an apple charger . 
i have bought all num_num from salton directly . 
would definitely recommend to someone who is rough on their things . 
easy to load and cover before pressing the start switch on our microwave . 
i keep flour ,  sugar and brown sugar in mine . 
i have avoided salad spinners for years because of past disappointments . 
love this !  bought it for my dad for christmas . 
from the first slice the knife has proven its weight in num_extend
and the battery lasts forever now !  i m sold on seidio products . 
it worked out great and was a great size . 
this toaster is reliable ,  reasonably fast and easy to clean . 
the battery seems to last a long time . 
thanks to amazon and customer reviews this caught my attention . 
they have a pleasant appearance and look nice on the frig . 
a lot nicer than the typical plastic rings . 
when you close the boom ,  it tends to  snap  shut . 
finish was not that of fine furniture but okay for the task . 
this holder for num_num knives does exactly what i want it to do . 
the dough comes out very easily and cleanly . 
unfortunately it broke with the first drop but i ll just order another . 
ok ,  so i bought this fan about a month ago . 
this is a handy addition to the food processor . 
takes decent pictures and videos and is quite thin . 
you can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet . 
to avoid scratching when scooping contents we use plastic measuring cups and spoons . 
these tongs are the perfect length for cooking on the grill . 
my sister asked for black measuring spoons and cups for christmas . 
when i want to resume resuming the ear buds are easy to retrieve . 
its a very high quality case for this price if you ask me . 
when open ,  the tongs are num_extend inches apart . 
i have never had a headset that paired as quickly as the extreme . 
oxo tongs ,  good quality for a china product . 
oxo makes solid products and nothing lasts forever . 
we have tried perk and press and melita and a dozen drip machines . 
after researching several grills ,  i decided upon this one . 
so far no scratches !  !  would definitely recommend buying . 
many of our friends who have never seen one are amazed . 
if you re considering the store protectors ,  go with this instead . 
it grinds the beans as course or as fine as you want . 
so impressed i m getting sizes for all my pans . 
a thoughtful gift for anyone who enjoys wine . 
frequency response appears to be about num_extend to num_extend thd about %
this product was inexpensive and my daughter loves it .

this is the best coffee pot in the world .

the unit is kind of ugly and quite large . 
i love the way they look and handle . 
i use it for all proteins and coffee in the morning . 
reaches every corner of my stainless steel large sink . 
my first one broke because i dropped it on my hard tile . 
however the replacement piece is designed much better and is easily available . 
definitely serves its purpose and does what its supposed to . 
plus i could dock it without having to take it off the phone . 
see youtube for tips on installation to avoid bubbles and dust . 
check the grind between pulses until you have the grind you want . 
i know some folks seem to be having a problem with it . 
the plates and bowls are slim and the mugs aren t oversized . 
a number num_num melita will also work with that hario filter . 
the size of this knife is just right . 
the price is high but anyway ,  it contains num_num filters . 
would prefer they were not teflon ,  but otherwise they are great . 
use the other vacuum to suck them away . 
the good news is that i know just exactly which one to buy . 
the motor speeds things up  no pun intended  . 
these were perfect for the short jars i purchased on amazon .

it works great and i would recommend it for most people . 
i ve used it when driving and could hear very well . 
overall ,  it s an excellent case and i highly recommend it . 
this sharpener does an excellent job in a matter of seconds . 
it has a little weight but is not too heavy . 
it shows when you need pairing and when the device is connected . 
that means it fits in a lifeproof and an otterbox case . 
these boxes are tough durable and most of all indistructable . 
the cradle can go both portrait and landscape . 
we make our own egg bacon muffins for breakfast . 
i wish i would have bought this case years ago . 
but certainly works great on this ambidextrous model . 
it is great for marinating my chicken or porkchops . 
as multiple reviewers have mentioned ,  speaker stands are terribly overpriced . 
when yours arrives ,  gaze at it and think of num_extend
the amcase is shorter than an acase stylus which i prefer . 
i look to many more years from this great appliance .

this has the adapter plus a travel charger for an amazing price . 
it is a great size for most utensils and pot lids .

you really can t beat it for the price . 
i consider it a good investment for my iphone . 
good range of features and specifications for the price . 
my mom told me not to about num_num years ago .

great price and exactly what one would expect from pyrex . 
and don t have to speak up to be heard . 
i tried several attempts precisely following the mfg . 
can t get a better case for the price . 
num_extend cut your food into bite sized pieces . 
becasue of this i am constantly battling congestion and dust of everything . 
the base ,  the stand and various parts are made of plastic .

the cable is also great for syncing with my pc . 
the device works well in a hotel room where signal is weak . 
when i opened the envelope the box was open . 
i bought num_num and all num_num work excellently . 
my daughter took it and is okay with it . 
i expect to get at least num_num out of this one . 
compare it to my other num_num inch pans ,  and was amazed . 
the stainless steel looks gorgeous too !  i love making pancakes in mine . 
the extreme ,  on the other hand ,  is very sleek .

it goes from refrigerator to the microwave oven with ease . 
easily makes two quarts of ice cream at a time . 
even my cat doesn t seem to mind it . 
they are easy to open ,  yet never pop open on their own .

i bought this item becuase we only eat home made bread . 
the stainless ones without liners smell icky and corrode from num_extend
inconvenient meaning it s slightly tough to get to turn off . 
this product works great and it is exactly how it is described . 
but then ,  i might not last that long ,  either . 
you can see the blue indicator in the product picture . 
then plug it in and wait until the light turns blue . 
i use it to scoop shrimp or other things out of larger pots . 
it does a nice job on all but the most stubborn stains . 
especially for someone setting up a new kitchen . 
i can put instructions for kitchen appliances under and still see num_extend
all i can say is what are you waiting for ?  . 
this juicer was bought for a friend after he visited and saw mine . 
the popcorn will burn and smoke if overcooked  . 
the others have a delay when you hit the key on the iphone . 
i bought num_num place settings in lemongrass ,  tangerine ,  turquoise and yellow . 
if you r looking for the original charger this is the one . 
i have had mine for well over a year now . 
it can charge my tablet too ,  though it has wonderful battery life . 
i love silicrylic s hard shell cases with the silicone . 
the price was better than sam s club and costco . 
this is an official blackberry oem car charger . 
even if it falls ,  the phone stays locked into place . 
highly recommendable and very convenient with the usb port . 
i also had no idea how to do this thing . 
until then ,  i ll just have to do the best i can . 
i hope they improve the earloop in the next version of this . 
that is about the only cons that come to mind . 
in part this can be due to its sensitivity . 
this charger was exactly what the doctor ordered . 
i can freeze individual serving sizes and use only what i need . 
it charges the phone very fast in about an hour . 
this was great bul buy that will supply me for a few months . 
but it works ok ,  especially if your phone has excellent angle views . 
no kitchen is complete without one of these hanging around . 
they do come out with a nice crisp crust . 
and as an added bonus ,  they look nice . 
i used it to bake a pair of baguettes . 
the heating elements in my unit are mostly uniform . 
i m happily munching on it as i type this review . 
i purchased this cable for my cell phone . 
the skin fit the face of the nexus s perfectly . 
the diagrams are small and vague ,  and not intuitive . 
we love the look of the fiesta pasta bowls . 
this can make better popcorn than the movie theater ,  easily . 
i have had this model for several years and just love it . 
that s why i give this a high rating . 
not having a frame makes it so nice and space saving . 
exact same battery that came with the phone !  perfect match . 
and one of the best soft cases i have ever tried . 
however it does just fine for that amount . 
i ordered this for a set of extra long twin box springs . 
theoutside will fit inside festool saw dust port openings . 
it s nothing you can t fix up with the enclosed wrench . 
it could use a better space for frozen food or ice cubes . 
after all ,  one s finger can very easily overlap both buttons . 
it s also very easy to use ,  and has a foolproof design . 
i am still astonished at how effective it is in that regard . 
the purchase of this espresso maker was for my sister . 
each screen protector included a little cleaning rag as well . 
i probably have around num_num popping sessions over the last num_num years . 
it has extremely long battery life and a quick recharge time . 
i really love this . very decent sound quality !  good range . 
i have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob . 
wish we d spent the extra money on this one to begin with . 
this is really a great tool for baking . 
makes great uniform balls and works well on tomatoes . 
so i broke the original carafe that came with my cappresso coffee maker . 
bought with the portfolio and writes well and handy as a stylus too . 
after num_extend years the first one broke at the top of the earloop . 
aside from the fit issue ,  i like the lid . 
i m pretty sure my mom liked the tiny one better . 
the unit is very sleek and pretty as well . 
what goes where and how to do it . 
i had no problems with the machine or with sticking or anything . 
this pot does the job in a few minutes . 
the container  like a comet can  is gold with blue and white writing . 
this one is perfect and i am very pleased with it . 
good thing that the unit is still working . 
have used it once to clean about num_num sq . 
peeling has never been more fun !  i love this peeler . 
i was so tired of dusting the shelves and hoped this would help . 
for these occasions ,  i will pop on the oem bumper case . 
basically ,  navigating an iphone app is an adventure ,  and not intuitive . 
they always have the best to choose from . 
i have taught my family the rule too . 
they work great ,  are sharp and perfect for cutting chicken breasts . 
i have six of them and highly recommend them . 
i gave up on them because of the lack of signal quality . 
it seems appropriate and looks quite nice and professional . 
this one was highly rated and it is a very good pan . 
it is a little large ,  but it is very sturdy and shiny . 
the pan is large enough to broil enough meat for two . 
the coffee brews quickly ,  and is hot and tastes perfect . 
the coasters are very well made and have no issues with the finish . 
i will still season this pan after every use . 
i usually just add butter and salt ,  but you can add anything . 
i put this together in just about num_num minutes . 
quick ,  easy ,  and clean up is a snap . 
believe me ,  this is a nice work perk . 
bought these for a friends birthday ! she loved them . 
the headset is light and comfortable enough to wear for extended periods . 
instructions are easy to follow ,  anyone can put them on . 
a flexible alternative to swealtering in still air . 
i like the way the handle works .  .  . so ingenious . 
for bigger things i use a chefs knife . 
a medium guitar pick works best for that ,  btw . 
with this case you can always see it !  . 
those flimsy metal tops that all jars come with become rusty quickly . 
it s very nearly too ghastly to tell you how brilliant it is . 
it looks very sharp especially if you re a steelers fan . 
sharpened every knife that i had with excellent results . 
and they turn out less bitter than when i brew manually . 
if mine ever broke i d buy another the same day . 
i have two other crock pots both larger . 
i cut that piece of with a razor knife .  . problem solved . 
these are great glasses other than the mislabling this time . 
it is definitely a part of the kitchen because it s heavy . 
i ve had this phone for about num_num weeks now . 
i feel that it is a marvelous product . 
then adds the rest of the fruits and vegetables . 
we switched to this chemex from a french press . 
needed a solid chefs knife and thought of getting a more expansive one . 
the press has large and comfortable handles ,  and a very solid feel . 
i disliked all of the various glass sets we had for various reasons . 
this case hits the sweet spot for protection and footprint . 
revive a old broken up phone holding everything in place . 
great for fixing breakfast for the family or just one person . 
i ordered this blade and disc holder as a replacement . 
they are very sturdy and pretty easy to clean . 
i just got this item and i have already enjoyed it very much . 
so for this phone i read both ways . 
easy to take care of and store not to mention clean . 
i do not use it to cut and or chop on . 
i screwed it into a stud and it works as advertised . 
i am so very happy i found this case . 
this large angled spatula is a great help with cooking and baking projects . 
it works better than i thought it would . 
have it in the basement in the walk in closet . 
i couldn t more surprised to say that i prefer the mr . 
this coffee grinder is a steal for this price . 
i experimented a bit making toast before giving my regular toaster away . 
this window fan is even better than i thought . 
this is exactly what my husband wanted and couldn t find locally . 
other companies make bluetooth gear that handles this more easily . 
touchwiz ,  while it looks pretty nice ,  performs pretty terribly . 
its just more easier to comprehend how to use it . 
i did have to make sure i popped it in just right . 
i took it out of the box and used it immediately . 
just what i ve come to expect from boxwave . 
and it would be nice if there were four of them . 
super easy to know when you ve got the right amount of liquid . 
what i opened with it was glass jars . 
i just made good use of the amazon promotion . 
i had been using pocket pouches with blackberry devices for years . 
finsh is sharp and perfect ,  and gives the machine more versatility . 
i can read my books as a passenger with it plugged in . 
this whisk is wonderful for  getting into corners  of containers with vertical sides . 
let your food processor do the work for you !  . 
it is just too small for normal tasks . 
learned that the hard way with my first one . 
 very fast if you order more than one phone . 
this brushed steel bottle opener is well designed and well made . 
it cleans pretty easily after you soak it . 
i used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on youtube . 
we just bought this one to have a bigger size . 
i purchased this because i make berry jams and jellies . 
so ,  if that s what you are looking for ,  skip these . 
so i got her a six foot cable to charge her iphone with . 
feel good to have this in my care incase my battery runs out . 
the burrs are ceramic and should last forever . 
i got this item very quick and in perfect shape . 
using this with my droid x multimedia desktop dock . 
however ,  i would not put this thermometer in the dishwasher . 
the skillet is a lodge ,  well made and easy to keep seasoned . 
the other reviewers are exactly right about the drips and leaks . 
i have been using foodsaver products for several years now . 
this one does what it should and holds up well in the dishwasher . 
they are east to get on and off amd make great gifts !  . 
this case looks cool and feels good in your hands . 
i have given them to friends and family too . 
i bought these for my dad after he seen them on tv . 
i have replaced the bowl once in that time because of cracks . 
this knife has successfully shucked num_num oysters on two separate occasions . 
figuring out how to use it is a bit of a frustration . 
it created lots of smoke ,  but seasoned it quickly . 
you can replace both items ,  but they re not cheap . 
my husband hated them and complained that they didn t roll right . 
perfect for giving the phone a bit more protection . 
bristles are not too stiff ,  nor too soft . 
the last time it nearly kicked the bucket  circuit ?   . 
i have the artisain num_num quart and now i have this one . 
spray or use cleaning cloths ,  then polish with the mitt . 
other than that ,  it holds my phone comfortably . 
especially since previous screen protectors were only good for a week or less . 
you also only get one pre screen cleaner . 
cr s best buy is a eureka model at almost double the cost . 
i will update review in a few more weeks . 
none the less i bought the product and it fits perfectly . 
it is quiet and does a great job mixing . 
it also tends to nudge a newly applied screen protector out of num_extend
you get the protection but lose the feel of pushing the buttons . 
i also like that it counts up as well as down . 
i would miss mashy it anything happened to him !  . 
this is probably because i am always connected to internet . 
this power connector s best feature i think is its small size . 
we bought four of these and gave them to him for his birthday . 
but ,  um ,  its like $ years of use ,  excellent performance . 
i use this to provide extra power for my gopro with skeleton housing . 
easy to clean if you follow the instructions . 
the num_num cutting boards arrived ,  and already i ve used all three . 
it is a wonderful solo skillet for cooking ,  serving ,  and baking . 
i like the ergonomics of the handle too . 
i still seasoned it more myself so food can just wipe out . 
it has easily assembly with only about num_num parts . 
i used this with an htc thunderbolt and everything worked fine . 
but this is what makes it such a great citrus zester . 
i plan on frying up some chicken in oil next . 
espresso is made by a completely different method using extremely finely ground coffee . 
the camera app has been improved so that it saves custom settings now . 
i should have bought it when i purchased the cooker . 
my wife had to get them out for me . 
super easy to clean and the cutest little size you can image . 
i really like the quality of screen protectors from splash . 
no fuss no frills just does what it says . 
it does everything the new phone of today do . 
it is a quality product and grates very fine . 
inexpensive but very sleek and nice ,  has a good non slip feel . 
i think i must have a cuisinart food processor fetish of some sort . 
nothing is like fresh popcorn with you controlling your own butter intake . 
i am also very pleased at how easy it is to clean . 
my old battery went bad after a long use . 
the only service used thru att is phone and text . 
i used this at least once a day . 
wife loves it she s happy so i can t complain . 
a broken solder joint inside the plug was the issue . 
this black and decker does none of that . 
i like this case overall and use it a lot . 
the screen protector was mirrored and it was not what i expected . 
the seidio cases are hands down much nicer . 
both ports arelabeled nicely so you can quickly distinguish between the two . 
this item is in my kitchen on my kitchen sink . 
i was pleasantly surprised by the plum bowl s rich ,  deep color . 
i bought this knfe for chopping and it does this task effortlessly . 
i m sure i left this feedback already but anyway here we go . 
what a great price for a good product . 
from the beginning ,  i could feel the excellent design quality . 
when my family lived at home ,  i loved the large ones . 
i washed it in the dishwasher and is still good as new . 
overall i find it a great case for the price . 
i have had no problems with it what so whatever . 
it should have a beep to let you know when to talk . 
not only does the water taste good ,  it is also much softer . 
the unit i bought included an extra mug which is also a great num_extend
it is very easy to use and works great . 
fits my phone perfectly and protects it too . 
very sharp ,  and stays really sharp with good care . 
ordered this armband and got it about one week later . 
many people report that their espresso tastes burnt . 
i received the product ,  it works as advertised . 
used it for num_num weeks away from home ,  no problems at all . 
i use all of them regularly except for the dough blade . 
but i have never received it last year after i ordered it . 
i use it frequently to make chicken breast fillets . 
have used this charger for more than a year . 
the only thing i can ask here is  .  .  . trust . 
the only drawback is that can get loud when turned to maximum speed . 
found this frother on amazon and boy does it work . 
the difference between breadwith or without it is amazing . 
i use it for downloading my canon num_extend dslr and it is perfect . 
with this phone the device has to be removed a certain way . 
the second was defective and spewed corn kernels all over the kitchen . 
i purchased it on a lightning deal and could not be happier . 
going to be using these for a while . 
the cheers set by mikasa make great bar and drinking glasses . 
a few minutes of cooking will then blend in the flavors . 
the connector fits perfectly in my galaxy num_extend epic num_extend touch from sprint . 
clip that can be used to attach wire to clothes breaks off easily . 
was replacing an older version of the same unit . 
the grill was even better than i expected after reading the other reviews . 
i had one ,  but lost it on my last vacation . 
it pops the popcorn kernals in about num_num minutes i would say . 
it is easy to reverse the unit from left ear to right ear . 
the screen is clearer and the sound volume is better . 
for some games with lots of tapping it is great . 
i also like the ear hook ,  which is a first . 
found this product to be a valuable addition for supporting microwave cooking . 
i can t wait to see how well this works over time . 
headset info :  it has audio based info  ie . 
it s difficult to review a product like this . 
this purifier seems to clear the room of dog hair and doggy odors . 
not as quiet as i would like ,  but still running strong . 
this is easy to clean ,  which is very important . 
i have used other brands but find these to hold up better . 
as other reviewers mentioned there are no inner seams . 
gone thru all num_num bc have replaced my phone that many times . 
but so far ,  all have arrived in perfect condition . 
snapped open more easily and snapped closed more easily . 
too much thinking for me !  plus ,  they were just so hokey . 
you can only time one thing at a time . 
it helps prevent the bottoms from burning before the tops are done . 
the glass itself is good quality without any bubbles . 
hope this lasts longer than that one did . 
i agree it is light ,  but it fits fine . 
makes for a perfect turkey every year !  worth the money . 
it matches my new white stove ,  which is why i ordered it . 
exactly what i needed to get rid of all my old plastic tupperware . 
doesn t add much weight or bulk to the phone either . 
it works great and i haven t had any problems with it . 
another pretty phone case that i really love . 
it is easy to mix any and everything in . 
they give a clean taste and i think they are worth it . 
it hasn t discolored ,  it still works just fine . 
i bought my first machine elsewhere online and paid several hundred dollars more . 
i guess in num_num i ll have to make a new strip . 
i just needed something inexpensive that i could have greater ringtone volume . 
this is the best whisk i ve every used . 
the coffee is excellent and it stores in a minimal space . 
my only cost is to ship back the broken one . 
you an spend more ,  but you will wish you didn t . 
that is like charging your iphone num_extend num_num times . 
it give you view option like real microsoft outlook . 
charges just fine and keeps a charge just fine . 
this is a really nice simple minimalist design that works . 
the itorch is just the thing i need to keep me connected . 
i like to cook ,  and my stove is fancy . 
i am pleased with this replacedment dough hook for my kitchenaid . 
so far i have no complaints and would order it again if needed . 
there is just something special about coffee made from a percolator . 
it mixes triple batches of heavy dough effortlessly . 
it will tip if things aren t evenly distributed . 
cut outs for camera and speaker holes are num_extend
i ended up purchasing another phone for this reason . 
well worth the $ i roughly paid per skillet . 
it s not going to be the ultimate media player . 
and i feel like more of a man as well . 
it makes the best expresso ever and is easy to clean . 
and loves her new rolling pin and base . 
the num_extend is a smartphone for the techie . 
now if only it had a hook so i could hang it . 
the num_num trays that come with it are a joke . 
i also like the stainless steel finish and the sturdy construction . 
i opened the box and an odor hit me like a hammer . 
i ve learned to closely monitor parts of the phone . 
i was willing to pay a little more for a good set . 
the negative comments may have been made by buyers of the  old  model . 
i ve found that his depends on the specific dishwasher . 
love the options and the case to protect them . 
and they are brand name ,  so i know they will work . 
this was an original otterbox at a great price . 
the ice cream will retain its smoothness for days this way . 
if there is a downside ,  cleanup would be it . 
it looks exactally the same down to the speckled black and white enamel . 
i like it but it weights a lot . 
this is fully functional ,  firmly gripping my iphone . 
i like the num_num inch so hot oil doesn t bite me . 
i do love to cook homemade apple sauce in my round ones . 
just the right color and style that i wanted . 
so if it ends up coming off i may need to glue it . 
the surface has just enough  texture  to keep the phone from sliding around . 
the fact that is reversible is very useful . 
there is nothing hd or high definition about this skin . 
made in usa ,  so wonderful in that sense . 
the sound is outstanding ,  much better than my motorola num_extend
everybody had good things to say about the braun . 
this is not going to be used any other way . 
they come flat and have to be folded to fit the cone . 
i like how these filters are a little more thicker than the averagefilters . 
this works great on fish and also had good luck turning fried eggs . 
i am highly impressed with the service and it also arrived within days . 
the iphone num_num had been out a couple of weeks . 
if you keep it seasoned and sprayed ,  the center won t stick . 
in truth ,  the serious baker will have different pins to select from . 
don t understand why people have trouble with it . 
i love it and use it several times a week . 
this is a very good product and i recommend it highly . 
i m sure there are good dutch ovens out there for less . 
i would never go back to plastic hangers after having these . 
it s a noisy little devil ,  but it makes wonderful popcorn . 
i am a fan of using a french press to make coffee . 
i had always purchased hard shell covers for my bb torch . 
the sound quality seems very good and has good volume . 
these gloves are the best capacitive gloves ever invented . 
i opened it and to my surprise it was in perfect condition . 
the health benefits derived from this good substitute for ice cream are manifold . 
when i opened the box i though ,   oh no  . 
great quality ,  very strong to use in mixing . 
they all work as expected and i was very pleased with the quality . 
originally i would see people walking around with these lt . 
overall this phone case is onlyfor look and style . 
this was exactly what i was looking for . 
the last thing ,  is that it only comes in black . 
came in a generic box ,  but packaged well . 
we have just purchased a third for my wife s art studio . 
the screen is still tight and filtering like a pro . 
a friend mentioned cell boosters and i was interested and started investigating . 
cleaning is a lot easier than a greasy frying pan would be . 
simple and safe coffee thanks ,  in part ,  to these filters . 
what i can tell you is the customer service has been great . 
covers the phone well with the exception of the face of the phone . 
if you have a droid num_num you should get this dock . 
i tried num_num different sensations and they all had the same issues . 
i use this for my coffee and it certainly does the job . 
i guess this is simply caused by heat . 
except for the gap in the handles it is a nice small appliance . 
this is a nice wireless headset w one caveat . 
i bought the larger one for sugar and flour . 
received this and used it immediately and was very very satisfied . 
the other way is to turn the phone off and back on again . 
new trent has hit the mark with this compact little battery pack . 
it has a pause button ,  but no volume buttons . 
i use this to mix gravy base before cooking in the sauce pan . 
this is still working several months after i bought it . 
would recommend to anyone who s looking for this style . 
i have no problem recommending this product and assigning num_num stars . 
it comes with the most common stuff you will need . 
this was just something i wanted to pick up for fun . 
everyone has the new iphone num_num which has a different jack . 
it s awesome for pancakes ,  eggs ,  french toast ,  etc . 
so now after using for awhile the rust has started . 
the infusing basket acts like a teabag and is really easy to clean . 
will probably buy another and take to the jobsite . 
however ,  swype and other keyboard apps can improve your virtual keyboard experience . 
i can sit my tablet up and watch movies . 
once we got this attachment ,  we haven t looked back . 
this product is not a heavy item ,  but it works very well . 
it is of wonderful quality and has held up beautifully . 
it works great and makes it plenty hot . 
i bought the culligan faucet filter a few months back . 
sticking is a none factor and cleans nice . 
i purchased num_num and will purchase num_num at a time until i have num_extend
scooping out num_num cup of soup from the pot is a breeze . 
i grind my coffee coarse as instructed ,  and the filter works great . 
this is very simply device that is inexpensive but works very very well . 
the kettle was what i expected and was great . 
i can t wait to make mashed potatoes with it . 
having it on low doesn t bother my sleeping either . 
seidio has really done a great job with this charger . 
it is the easiest ,  compact and powerful vac i had . 
i got this phone case today and i really like it . 
if you own the mixer then you have to purchase this utensil . 
my wife likes it enough to forgo her coach case for this case . 
i would never pay that much for something like this for myself . 
plus ,  it s le creuset and the price is super reasonable . 
this japanese kettle works well ,  looks well made . 
it leaves much of the pulp of medium and large oranges unprocessed . 
i also love the pocket on the outside . 
it seems like it s made of really good plastic . 
it lives on my counter and gets used every day . 
i often need to measure out the liquids i use . 
this grater will be with me a long time . 
learn to do that and no scrubbing or dishwasher will ever be missed . 
this was a good choice and the price is right . 
take it out and flip the dough over . 
i ordered this machine on friday and received it on saturday . 
seemed like it took forever to get here . 
the walnut wood is beautiful !  it fits nicely in the closet . 
maybe dark plum also ,  but its a great fit and very sturdy . 
arrived in a timely manner from amazon in perfect condition . 
guess it will be obsolete for me if i upgrade to the iphone num_extend
so it will wear out in four or five years with regular use . 
these are quality plastic and really do a good job . 
overall these shortcomings are outweighed by the positives of this device . 
 i ve used the recipe on the bisquick box with great num_extend
it also means that the image from the screen is unaffected . 
the weight should waggle but not bang against the vent stem . 
i use these boards for my triple layer num_num inch cakes . 
i use this peeler to work with my chocolate blocks . 
i num_extend these in num_num for ten dollars less each here at amazon . 
i agree with everyone else when it comes to their reviews . 
if you want more durable look for thicker bags . 
she clearly has minions to do all that . 
this works so great i bought a second one for office . 
it takes a little of effort to figure it our . 
the coffeemaker still makes perfect coffee and everything works like new . 
beans that are turned into  powder  don t brew very well . 
i basically like aroma stuff ,  they have good quality . 
very good grip ,  easy to hold and a strong steel spring . 
 it allows you to toast the cut side only  . 
does exactly what it needs to do and without the outrageous price . 
it is far safer than the $ fancy french folding model it replaced . 
the disassembly took about num_num minutes and wasn t too bad . 
the lifeproof is just num_num pieces ,  top and bottom . 
i ve used a lot of different screen protectors and options . 
i ve tried two of the tray type bacon cookers . 
after trying everything else ,  this is the one we use . 
has the same feel as all other magpul plastic products . 
it works very well and is an excellent additional power source . 
seems like it should ,  but just order num_extend
includes a video demonstration and couldn t be easier to use . 
check out beach camera for the new one in bulk packaging . 
this pot is easy to clean and is very versatile . 
i made the mistake of requesting the wrong battery . 
it also works well with a stiff cookie dough recipe i have . 
in no time at all i had evenly sliced five pounds of potatoes . 
i didn t get the matching chairs because they don t look comfortable . 
can t beat the price and the color is spot on . 
there really good headphones and i like that they were a good price . 
fits well ,  all buttons are operable and seems to embrace the phone . 
for a disabled person who has difficulty with working with knifes . 
also means you don t have to work so hard . 
this fan is great for blowing away some of the hot air . 
why i always struggled with manual can openers ,  i do not know . 
it s still reasonably priced ,  and an excellent value for the money . 
i initially purchased the smaller sibling of this rackj . k . 
i prefer the black to the original white ,  it shows less dirt . 
to finally have sharp nice knives feels good . 
no biggy !  being familiar with asian cuisine and technique helped . 
it fits very well ,  even with the num_extend extended battery . 
this was a good purchase but unfortunately this phone was lost or stolen . 
i replaced all my measuring cups with these glass pyrex ones . 
there are replacements through amazon or walmart ,  and the price is right . 
the blades are very sharp so be wary . 
seriously ,  this is another great pan at a fantastic price . 
whenever the batteries are installed ,  it is on . 
these are great for splitting raw chickens in half and similar chores . 
the battery life is amazing and the sound quality is top knoch . 
it heats perfectly even each and every time . 
this beats any cleaning product i have ever used . 
kill any apps running that are battery hoggs num_extend for example  . 
unfortantely the battery life of these is much worse than the num_extend
i was amazed at the quality of their products . 
my mom was amazed at how seasoned it really was . 
have had these over five years and could t be happier . 
perfect size  , holds an num_num lb roast easy . 
this is the best way to use them if your room design permits . 
charged with the micro usb connector included in this package . 
the older it gets the more flavorful your food turns out . 
it replaces my num_num year old mini cuisinart and is just as good . 
buying on amazon saves me a lot of money . 
i bought this grill because it fit my budget . 
you can even tell you have it on . 
it came in very basic package and good condition . 
i ve used them many times and they re great !  .

i couldn t believe how gray the dirty water was .

i needed a coat tree for my office  no closet  . 
he put up a rod over the center of the tub . 
although you should probably follow the washing instructions to a t . 
screen shattered to the point it needed to be replaced . 
just like the one i used in tasmania a few years ago . 
would have been num_num stars if not for the screen protector issue . 
the touch screen is iffy either too sensitive or inaccurate . 
it was my choice to purchase the model that calls for filters . 
closures on the side are tight and substantial . 
not a remote possibility ,  given his general character as revealed so far . 
at first i thought i had made an expensive mistake . 
since then i have bought two other combo units . 
wore an num_extend respirator outside ,  but that doesn t cover the eyes . 
with high electricity costs eating out isn t an option . 
delighted with the peeling action of this swivel peeler . 
tried cheaper bags and i always go back to these . 
i love using these flat whisks as opposed to bulbous type . 
i searched extensively for a pitcher to meet all my needs . 
utilizing the power of the mixer is ingenious . 
my cakes look great and not like some dinky little thing . 
the charger also works on any cell phone battery . 
the coating is slick and easy to clean ,  always . 
also ,  they go with any dishes you might already have . 
i only wish the handle was a bit bigger .

i bought the first one for my wife for christmas . 
and so much healthier for you than cooking over coals or gases . 
it is a button press to wake it up from standby . 
i have no problems with the handles bending . 
the only problem is that you can not wash the grinding part . 
it is also quiet and durable with multiple speeds . 
after a while of placing knives in it ,  it starts rusting . 
but i liked the stockpot so i replaced it with and identical model .

my son uses them with his nintendo dsi xl . 
better than the protector i had on my old iphone !  . 
you can only head one serving at a time . 
it heats up fast and works like a dream . 
its adjusts for all sizes of bread and it toasts evenly . 
in practice ,  it works ok when i pair it with two phones . 
i have a boost mobile num_extend and its battery drains quickly . 
these glass bowls clean easily ,  and are dishwasher safe . 
i like this much better than a vacuum type stopper . 
i ve experimented with toppings and will share a few of my favorites . 
my recipients agree that it s the best wok they ve ever used . 
saves on electricity and never burns any food . 
or maybe i just thought it would be too much work . 
so ,  i searched amazon and found a real deal . 
was just used this morning and worked great . 
having said that ,  the grill itself cleans easily . 
the bubbles were minimal ,  and easy to remove with massaging after . 
it is one or the other depending on the ear clip being used . 
the product is perfect ,  easy to install and holds two toothbrushes nicely . 
the travel cup lid cracked so i went looking for an actual thermos . 
but they don t tell you to use the tape . 
i m delighted to be able to find them on amazon . 
i ll try to remember to update when i know for sure . 
if you have a chemex coffee maker these are the filters to use . 
i m on my third and my mother is on her second . 
it only wraps around the back so your face is exposed . 
the battery life has been more than adequate for my very light usage . 
moderately priced and cleans up well i hand wash this . 
i recently moved into a condo that does not allow grilling outside . 
i liked it so much i ordered a pink one . 
would i buy this again  id i still had this phone  yes . 
the pots ,  lids and strainers and turkey stand are all aluminum . 
i will likely purchase more to use in the same manner . 
i find this handy car charger indispensable in my work !  . 
i ve not had any problems with it charging at all . 
looks nice in the kitchen and takes up very little space . 
if you drop the phone ,  it has a chance of cracking . 
it only covers the back and sides of the phone . 
the handle makes it easier to cut the dough . 
i hope it holds up to the test of time . 
but i m definately happy enough with this to buy again as gifts .

i have now had a response about it . 
i definitely recommend purchasing this for your phone . 
i purchased one as a gift for my son . 
the internals are identical to units much more expensive . 
the flashlight feature is an excellent bonus ,  too . 
and yes ,  i have only used it once . 
this little puppy makes that baking event % easier . 
made the iphone look different and so cool . 
this is a larger version of the paring knife . 
i suppose any unit in this price range will be similarly constructed . 
i enjoyed it ,  even though the process took me about num_num minutes . 
that is more of an apple complain than this unit though . 
 :   so ,  i m starting to think it s a refurbished phone . 
excellent product and will be back if it gives me trouble . 
multimedia :  this is a big of a mixed bag for me . 
this one has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum . 
about the only thing i wish it had was a keep warm setting . 
i had been making do with a smaller strainer which has been retired . 
i knew they could cut up to num_num ga . 
i can definitely hear every word of the tv .

love this thing !  i bought this oven after reading many reviews . 
i can leave my shoes on ,  or even slip them off .

the case feels good and is light weight . 
i used it to connect a digital cam with a flat screen . 
small and lightweight ,  gets the job done quickly . 
i had no real complaint about the product which would occasionally break . 
very nice quality and looks beautiful . really dresses up my kitchen table . 
i would recomend this to anyone thinking to purchase one . 
i haven t seen a better more effortless peeler .

plus it durable so that is an added plus . 
first ,  let s explore the differences and similarities between these three colanders . 
i ve had a several variations on the small george foreman champ grills . 
this cell phone is the best thing nokia to made . 
i can hear everyone and they can hear me with out yelling . 
it does fit close enough to use so i am satisfied . 
i recently developed a problem with connecting to my drone . 
all in all ,  pretty cool and priced to buy . 
i was looking for durable storage containers for leftovers ,  etc . 
the paper it s on is a good thickness . 
this skillet heats up quickly and has evenly distributed heat . 
i have not had any problems with heat or cold retention . 
it also no longer fit into my cradle . 
it has pretty much what every kitchen needs . 
it is especially useful for the mifi num_num which sucks battery really fast . 
it is easy to handle when cutting up food . 
if it gets knocked over in use it goes off . 
they released perfectly with a spritz of cooking spray . 
i like it ,  serves a great basic case . 
i actually didn t keep it more than a week . 
much hacking info available on the internet for this model . 
it seems to hold about one solid load of laundry . 
still it does what it is supposed to do . 
this was a great seller; i highly recommend !  . 
i m still perplexed and peeved that the cable isn t compatible . 
i like this for zesting and grating cheese . 
bravo to the company for creating such a wonderful product !  . 
it is very easy to fit to one s ears . 
this strong clear vinyl bag is perfect for that . 
be carefull of your fingers as it is very very sharp . 
i wish filling it was a little less cumbersome . 
i am sure i will get many years of use out of these . 
my xyboard num_extend has decent range ,  maybe num_num ft . 
hose good enough also ,  undamaged from stepping on it . 
i ordered this along with another oxo wooden spoon . 
i got my money s worth and then some . 
but based on our once use of it ,  it worked quite well . 
my only minor complaint is that i wish it was a bit taller . 
buy quality and you only have to buy it once . 
it went back down to $ and i scooped two more up . 
and found it to be a pretty heavy load . 
my idea of steam cleaning the carpet is  do it often  . 
this is a very good tea kettle for the money . 
reviews suggest some merchants are selling bad product under this listing . 
i am considering buying a second one just like it . 
never have to guess if your food is over or under cooked . 
this vacuum s power and attachments are first rate . 
aluminum distribute heat extremely well  second only to copper  . 
fit nicely over the slider and stayed in place . 
that is really the only thing that matters . 
i now have them in all cars and they work fantastic . 
it comes out of the pan great and looks great . 
the quality is good i only got one screw that was discolored . 
i m for anything that saves me time and works too . 
so far ,  i have recharged my iphone num_extend one complete time . 
i make about a gallon a juice a week on the average . 
planning to eat zucchini pasta twice a week now . 
let it cool completely and the lid wil work for years . 
cable works perfectly fine it is about num_extend long . 
high quality ,  fits like a glove and works nice . 
my kids love them and they will last a very long time . 
i finally caved and bought this one and i m glad i did . 
i would rather have that ,  but no big deal . 
so you won t bewasting your money shopping for new bags everymonth . 
just push the plunger and let it spin away . 
num_num times as expensive as this little guy for a good one . 
lay out paper towel s  on counter ,  set parts down . 
i can t tell you how many times i ve dropped corelle cookwear . 
if you cell service connection is poor the xlink connection quality also matches . 
probably as good as any other headset on the market . 
i went through motorolas on a yearly basis before i found this . 
this is the only grinder you will need . 
so i don t know if it s safe or not . 
you can read the other reviews about how awesome this phone is . 
we love them ,  they are sturdy and well made . 
a nice change from the old  and dirty  cloth filters . 
this is a tool ,  not a piece of heavy machinery . 
the slide switch is right at the top of the headset . 
blue s my favorite color so i m a happy camper . 
blue air num_num series we have works great . 
all the coffee goes into the carafe ,  every num_extend
nothing sticks to the pot so clean up is easy . 
it makes me happy just looking at it . 
i use my iphone charger block and it works fine . 
the quadrupling of volume that i mentioned above was with % milk . 
i know the company has a reputation for that . 
i would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a good case . 
the pen : i look for two things in a pen . 
after reading the reviews for the panasonic i decided to go for it . 
it works very well for all of the above . 
you must be careful to dry them though bc they will rust . 
i have used this before and ordered more they are perfect . 
i have no personal interaction with it ,  but he loves it . 
if you regularly use citrus juice in anything this is a must have . 
bought this set for my mother but have one of my own . 
i was afraid i was going to have to invent this myself . 
only time will tell if it is durable . 
highly recommend because it slices through everything ,  including bread ,  perfectly . 
these work ,  but they are not the same as the original . 
a quick rinse and it s ready for the next time . 
would recommend this to others if its going less than num_num dollars . 
one only lasted for a few uses before breaking . 
no issues with fitment or breakage like others mentioned . 
i ve had this unit about a week ,  or so . 
this is a nice bunch of handy tools to use for canning . 
the inflated  rail  around the edges kept him snug in bed all night . 
my other cases cover the volume controls and on and off button . 
we use it to slice home made breads as well as slicing roasts . 
you really notice the photograph and not the frame . 
it hangs on my wall above my butcher block . 
i to bought this knife because of the rating in cook s illustrated . 
resembles a num_extend movie when you are not wearing the glasses . 
magnetic towel bar has stays put on the side of the refrigerator . 
an excellent replacement for my lost ear hook . 
they re easy to use and easy to clean . 
the machine makes superb bread; no  door stops  here . 
i had no hassles with my order ,  they got here quickly . 
it does protect and it is small enough . 
the only problem is the front silicon peices . 
the cover for my new kitchenaid mixer is just wonderful . 
it fits very comfortably and looks a lot better than my plantronics . 
if you dont put it on just right it will keep coming off . 
mine doesnt pop out easily ,  its nice and sturdy and perfect  :   . 
the usb plugs into the base tightly also . 
be sure you measure your cabinet space before purchasing any of these baskets . 
then we saw these at amazon and ordered a set . 
my last case had a raised button with much better sensitivity . 
i do a lot of baking and helps me to measure things fast . 
sometimes warm up on num_num then cut back to one for the night . 
i ve even done the poaching and it worked out great too . 
all i can say is ,  i am so glad i did . 
i have had the same krups grinder for over num_num years . 
it is so roomy you can make an extra large batch . 
other than that ,  i am very satisfied and would buy again . 
only time will tell how much beating can it take . 
i ordered this to fit into one side of a double stainless sink . 
but now that i know ,  the rest are relegated to the garbage . 
it is just as described and pictured on website . 
thought i was going to get a cheap replacement  not the one pictured  . 
after consultation with the helpful sales assistant ,  we chose this casserole . 
my dil has some of these already and loves them . 
simple to use ,  many additional features if you want to use them . 
all the items i own are from the commercial line . 
i make small pancakes and it works the best . 
it also makes pouring the grinds easier somehow . 
i look forward to using it every morning . 
the service from the seller too was first class . 
i also received it much sooner than was expected . 
after two hours my phone was % charged . 
they are the perfect size to go with fondant flowers . 
i ike the stainless container to hold all the tools . 
this pair of headset fulfills all my requirements . 
i love that these keep stuff off my washer and dryer . 
i ate some of the popcorn ,  and i love it ,  too . 
it s a cheap trick to cut down on cleanup but . 
i prefer my french press over all other coffee i have tried . 
tried them out and they resolved every battery  issue  i thought i had . 
works great !  it looks like the oem charger and does the job . 
the mounting was easy ,  glued onto the tiles with silicone glue  included  . 
i have loved the cloth and now back to baking again . 
i tried it out the very first day after it arrived . 
seems the meltdown isn t as easy as some reviewers made it sound . 
my friend liked it so much ,  i got her one too . 
not so !  this boy takes some serious practice to get them right . 
i visited puerto rico and my hosts gave me coffee as a gift . 
i love my otterbox for my iphone great fit . 
it takes some rough use and had not dented yet . 
saute  pan with helper handle and lid for $
different from the iphone num_num case but works really well for my iphone num_extend
and the cut out for the ports are nicely done as well . 
i have also used it on my ipod num_extend
you cannot walk bare footed without feeling the grit . 
the first pair i got was defective when i first tried them . 
blades are always sharp and clean up is easy . 
the price is very fair considering the quality . 
these are the only dish brushes that i will use . 
they are also very stable when the rubber feet are applied . 
this replaced my old masher of num_extend years ,  love the oxo grip . 
it is the perfect size and fit for my car . 
two different sizes and a strainer make this a great funnel set . 
fgreat its the table well and easy care . 
i would not think twice about buying it again . 
i have had one of these knives for years . 
be careful ! it does a beautiful job on hard cheeses like parmesan . 
this model is great if you are a heavy baker . 
i ve used mostly stainless and plastic coffee mugs for the car . 
i wouldn t hesitate to get this case again . 
seems that era has passed . five stars for the product . 
can t think of any reason why you would want any other processor . 
works well ,  comfortable to hold and serve with . 
instead ,  you can wipe it clean with a dry paper towel . 
i bought the red ,  i wish i d gotten stainless steal . 
i was prepared to give this a poor rating . 
after num_num years i broke my first carafe . 
i tried riding around without the strap ,  and my phone fell out . 
looks cool and the rubber protects the iphone nicely . 
we use it for work ,  for communication ,  for entertainment etc . 
then life sets in and the white silicone quickly fades to a grayish . 
handle is a little lightweight ,  but not an issue for my uses . 
i got expensive designer bread at an excellent local bakery . 
the fondue maker is built very well and high quality . 
it tastes incredibly fresh and i love it . 
looks good and it is perfect for mixing drinks inside . 
you cover the top so it doesn t pop out . 
i was expecting a more baby pink and this is a clear pink . 
both were resolved with the wmf perfect plus . 
i handle it with care for fear of cracking it . 
great for wearing in the car during long drives . 
in any case ,  they work for both icon and era very well . 
i just bought this and have used it continuously . 
it is held loosely in place ,  which affects its sturdiness . 
dealing with this seller was so smooth and fast . 
pump it about num_num times and your readyto spray away . 
you have to make trade offs in areas . 
i put coffee in ,  water on top ,  and let it drip . 
i replaced them with stainless steel bowls and immediately regretted it . 
this is a perfect fit for the samsung droid charge . 
i believe that my children have used metal utensils in it . 
i even use it for pressing the burgers . 
the seller was quick and i am very pleased ,  awesome buy . 
i wanted another cheaper iphone to put on another line and chose the num_extend
i then tried out the shredder attachment and it shredded up carrots effortlessly . 
i hate cases that cover up the power buttons and volume rocker . 
these belts will ensure we can keep using it . 
i bought this slow cooker probably in the late num_extend
it s fun to experiment with the fruit combinations . 
some parts feel plasticy ,  but overall not bad quality . 
its slightly inconvenient but i highly recommend this route if possible . 
this is especially true for a precision instrument like a paring knife . 
it s also magnetized so it sticks to the white board we have . 
it s nice to always have an extra charged battery . 
this is the best way to cook bacon i have ever used . 
i use it mostly to grind flax seeds . 
the inexpensive price may cause some to turn up their nose . 
however ,  it had proved reliable and did a pretty good job . 
i ve made some baller java in this thing . 
this charger is very pretty and goes nice with my phone . 
i like little things ,  specifically little sweet things . 
i got my daughter a first phone and got a expensive glitter case . 
so at least with this she s looking to the side . 
guess i am lucky that mine is older . 
though there is a very slight gap along the top of the extensions . 
it s better if you use their brand of popcorn . 
i would definitely trade the extra usb port for an additional num_num mah . 
i have used my skillet a number of times now . 
i look forward to many years of faithful service from them . 
pretty fast charging ,  actually ,  when plugged into the wall . 
i love how it stands up in the cupboard . 
then it started not working and i realized because it is not forgiving . 
why ?  because the actual cooking area is too small for my needs . 
it makes having to refill smaller bags a thing of the past . 
we bought this set for a small desert house . 
stunningly beautiful ,  with a modern and yet timeless design . 
thus i could not use the bracket in the way it was intended . 
i like them better than hooks for many items . 
i was ready to return it but gave it one more shot . 
i purchased these to use with my steamfast mop . 
the price was great and had great delivery on this . 
it really is just the most adorable pitcher . 
i think it will shake more if the bread recipe was bigger . 
i don t understand how the cooker turns brown each time i cook . 
i have had my peeler almost num_num years . 
do not hesitate to treat yourself to these liners . 
you won t be dissapointed . thanks for reading my review !  . 
it works quickly and holds the battery well . 
cheap ,  but doesn t at all feel like it . 
this is the second order for these trays . 
i did ,  and i couldn t retire my old knives fast enough . 
this is an excellent product ,  i could not be more pleased . 
the mechanisms work smoothly and efficiently ,  with less effort . 
knob is marked off ,  low ,  medium ,  high and works well . 
we loved how nice and simple the knives look . 
i have to say i am very satisfied so far . 
ps my neighbor has num_num of these units !  !  !  !  !  . 
i have purchased patton fans in the past . 
hope that helps anyone who was as stuck as i was . 
my only complaint is that i wish it were a little bit louder . 
however ,  the linx roller stopped working within a year . 
and also pretty old with old tech into it . 
i wash it right away after every use . 
these work just perfect for my toaster oven . 
it makes it easier to open and no metal smell . 
i need to find a bit cooler place . 
i highly recommend these if you re looking for a pair of tongs . 
i ve been using liquid but i hate the drippy ,  sticky mess . 
i don t understand why this item has received so many bad reviews . 
so just rinse right away and there should be no problem . 
for an animal or cat lover this is super cute . 
if you want clean air ,  this purifier will flat out do it . 
they are ceramic and chip when my kids knock them num_extend
thankfully the sheet that comes with it is perfect . 
spanish rice was fantastic and will be trying split pea soup next . 
the construction is sound and consistency in cooking is great . 
but i m used to a much heaver chef s knife . 
i also purchase extra filters and the extra battery pack . 
no more scraped knuckles !  i love this item !  . 
plantronics really needs to make the phone a bit more friendlier to use . 
i wish amazon had offered all of the options . 
they re not bad at all ,  very good for the price actually . 
i do still appreciate my tupperware bowls for storing larger items . 
but for my purposes ,  white is just fine . 
two things keep this from being a num_num star rating . 
new canner here and this is my first pressure canner . 
i got that package with num_num of each plate broken . 
it conforms well to the hand as you scoop . 
your taste buds will thank you for it . 
i bought this one and am so impressed by it . 
overall it is less bulky than carrying a wallet and my phone . 
i bought this for my husband who cooks constantly . 
i figured for the price i really had nothing to lose . 
my email is gmail so all that was seamless . 
i would buy again and would recommend to a friend . 
had to stop using it when i upgraded to iphone num_extend
the design is perfect and it functions well . 
i received it today and it is perfect . 
the actual wheel is very sturdy and does not wiggle . 
i use screen savers on all the cell phones in the family . 
it whips the frozen fruit into a wonderful smoothie . 
i like the length of the base of the whisk . 
cannot say enough good things about this platter . 
obviously ,  more expensive than the glass or plastic varieties . for num_extend
i have a older model of this time . 
this is perfect for easily sliding your shower current across the bar . 
they are expensive but well worth the cost . 
love not having to wash the pitcher every day . 
the cutouts for the volume keys and camera are all correct . 
just received my amazonbasics tpu case for my iphone num_extend
good heft which makes it stay in place on the counter . 
i can hang jeans and cargo pants on them with no issues . 
they worked great to keep the wine bottles cooled once they were opened . 
this is by far the easiest can opener that i ve ever used . 
whip up a frozen treat in less than num_num mins !  . 
like a lot of other cases ,  this one does the job . 
for the price ,  this is a great set of three . 
i didn t even need to look at the directions . 
it does a nice job of making dull knives moderately sharp . 
i would not hesitate to buy another if this ever quits . 
as a result ,  i have five different types of openers . 
this is a very nice ,  heavyweight measuring cup . 
however ,  i think this will be a great purchase . 
if the knife is not sharp enough repeat procedure . 
these are wonderful tools and make great stocking stuffers . 
it does not have the new usb num_extend
this said , you will want to protect your investment . 
this was the workhorse of the imaxpower line of products . 
i ve been using a plantronics voyager num_num headset the last few years . 
all of the buttons and ports are easily accessible . 
the reviews concerning the volume of heat is true . 
go to their individual profile and leave your bad reviews . 
you will need at least two packages but they re worth it !  . 
the wilton lifter is excellent for eight inch cakes . 
i love looking at it on my kitchen counter . 
i wouldn t advise using this skillet on a glass top . 
it cools wine in num_num minutes as advertised and looks sleek and stylish . 
we use the actual insert for all types of charger accesories . 
sharpens knifes ,  but i suspect the angle is a bit too steep . 
my larger ,  heavier jawbone will transmit up to num_num feet or so . 
i like them very much and am happy with the purchase . 
i did what the other reviewers said to do . 
the recommendations on antenna placement seemed really difficult to comprehend . 
i have one for myself and i purchased this one for my mom . 
it is very nice and well worth it . 
but i got the silicone extended battery case and this fixed that problem . 
the blue is a bit darker than pictured  nicer ,  in my opinion  . 
big enough to put on sixteen plus cookies . 
the fit and finish is good but not great . 
i have owned this can opener for a couple years now . 
the shelf is sturdy and expands to just the right size . 
i would recommend it to some people who like s flowers . 
now i am happier to cut my slices of apples without hurting myself . 
the entire case is also very easy to install and also to remove . 
it also comes with extra ear wrap and inner ear pieces . 
my wife tends to be  can opener challenged  .

muy buena experiencia con el sonido del mismo . 
doesn t add much bulk and still offers a good level of protection . 
this device is practical and reasonably priced when compared to other air purifiers . 
also doesn t include and screen protection ,  just body protection . 
however ,  before the num_extend phone arrived ,  i got these new batteries .

i mean really who is going to steal a cassette tape . 
be sure to begin with pulse and check the progress . 
so i bought the expensive high grade version and i m very please . 
so far the blade has stayed sharp and there s been no leaking .

when i first got this waffle baker ,  i really was disappointed .

the buttons are a bit sticky and recessed too much for reach . 
this thing is also very hard to clean . 
i bought this one after purchasing another for my other phone . 
they worked just fine ,  and the num_num count is worth the price . 
it is dishwasher safe and it is already a very good point . 
had previously had anchor hocking but the dishwasher washed off the measurements .

it has worked as advertised and exceeded my expectations . 
this is a nice charger that works perfectly with the iphone num_extend
it is easy to use and takes care of the job lickety split . 
this is the best leather case you can get in this price range .

as of this writing ,  this fry pan is a killer deal . 
makes getting cheese platters ready very easy and fast . 
life with the itorch num_num is very easy for someone on the go .

you can slice paper thin or any width you prefer . 
i don t know why i didn t have this sooner . 
must admit that i am very pleased with it . 
i owned kershaw knives before i ever even heard of shun . 
stainless steel ,  carbon steel and cast iron can handle the high temperature .

exactly what i need for my samsung galaxy ii . 
and yes i was peeling the the skin off tomatoes . 
it s put together well and remember this is not an expensive screen .

it was unwieldy and i did not need two smaller sized bins .

liquids run across the cooking surface like they re molten lava . 
use that extra time you save to concentrate more on the main dish . 
we are using these to hang christmas lights . 
with a sticker ,  you better get it right the first time . 
the cons is when changing it ,  the old one can get stuck . 
this is all you need for a simple bar look . 
hopefully i ll have better luck this time around . 
this thing is a little odd looking but it s just beautifully engineered . 
this also prohibits pocket calls and have recommended to other friends . 
function meets form and works great !  highly recommended . 
this charger works excellent for my evo and the wife s evo shift . 
i had no clue that it came with that feature . 
there s always the fear of sliced fingers ,  cuts and deep wounds .

you ll only have to refill it every couple of weeks . 
calibrate it ,  and this battery will last all day under heavy use . 
it took a while for it to boot up . 
keeps pasta fresh and takes up a very small footprint in my pantry . 
the steaks came out much more tender than cooking on the stove .

i bought this for my sister for christmas . 
but it also has benefits in terms of num_extend

if you clean these properly they will never crack and last forever . 
this is easy to fix . the case issue fix . 
this meat hammer arrived quickly and is of great quality . 
we mostly use it to cook up greasy breakfast foods and steaks . 
easy to use and the results are spectacular . 
results are identical to using a conventional oven . 
the adjustable temperature setting is my favorite feature . 
and like everyone else ,  i wish the cord was longer . 
this fan is built in the usa ,  which is nice . 
the arm band is a typical ,  the belt clip is terrible . 
i have had troubles applying screen protector in the past . 
so much easier to just set your phone down and charge it . 
wonderful aroma ,  great texture ,  and using this cooker is ridiculously easy . 
the knife is not actually touching the counter or anything . 
although it is plastic ,  it seems very durable . 
once again ,  they said they would send it but never did . 
wonderful buy from amazon ,  my favorite place to shop !  . 
you don t catch me saying that very often ,  either . 
no big deal for me but some may not like it . 
this fits my epic num_extend touch very well . 
popped it out of the dishwasher last night and it looks like new . 
this is a great value case for the iphone .

i love the smell of the baking bread in the house . 
i have to bend it and twist it for it to charge . 
this coffee grinder works well and looks great on our countertop . 
i see this as a handy item to have around . 
the nordic ware releases beautifully with a minimum of greasing and flouring . 
so far ,  so good and it keeps my small room cool . 
we shouldn t have to compromise great hardware for poor battery life . 
the presto saves all but one paper towel and the paper plate . 
mesh fine enough so that grease doesn t splatter . 
the blade is thin so it cuts through ,  but is very strong . 
does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
i would order them again but believe they will last quite some time . 
and a host of other things like uninstalling apps you no longer num_extend
also made pizza dough and an incredible pie crust using this device . 
the fan works well and it s too noisy . 
keypad took a little getting used to  touchscreen  and switching to other characters . 
 so plan on num_extend is fairly well designed . 
a nice quality product that protects your phone and is priced right . 
i use this rice cooker several times a week . 
i purchased the otter box and she bought this ballistic case . 
i also like the stainless steel because i think it is more sanitary . 
set up for wine storage in my closet pantry . 
cheap ,  easy and delicious waffles is what you ll get . 
these are great for serving a variety of hot or cold foods . 
if you happen to get a phone that doesn t reboot keep it . 
the can weighs next to nothing ,  even when full . 
i was really dissappointed at first and emailed kmart complaining . 
it s also fairly light ,  and overall very convenient and portable .

this produces a very fine grind my herbs . 
many people mentioned that it s noisy but i don t think so . 
you only receive the box with a bag full of silica gel beads . 
i tried every kind of opener known to man . 
my only concern is that you have to refill the tank a lot . 
not by a little bit ,  but by a huge amount . 
this is my second purchase of this pan . 
i have no complaints a really good product . 
it is built very well and is sturdy . 
this dutch oven is a bit larger than you might think . 
the muffin rings arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion .

pizzas just slide right out ,  and washing up is a breeze .

just what the title says my daughters loved these . 
the phone takes up to a num_extend micro sd card for memory . 
this is the best fool proof way of making ice cream . 
i have the spatula and perforated scoop as well . 
note these are longer than your usual tootsie or blow pop length sticks . 
she uses her fingernails and has small num_extend
so ,  being glass ,  this pot requires care in use .

if you are a tech junkie or not . 
for a pack of num_extend they are quite affordable . 
love the color and it s beautiful just want you wanted . 
i ve noticed a little mechanical burning smell when grinding non stop . 
does it remove lead like it said its suppose to ?  dunno . 
i have never been disappointed with any wilton product . 
also like the quick apps on the screen that you can customize . 
set the houdini on top of the cork . 
this bag is far superior to the framed bags which collapse eventually .

if needed to purchase more would order from this company . 
i was using a incipio case at the time . 
very professional shape when done !  i am very pleased with this product . 
the unit was easy to put together and to install . 
i purchased these about a year ago and never wrote a review . 
i like to dehydrate jerky made from a jerky gun . 
i think it s the type of material it s made of . 
doing some research online i discovered this is a common problem . 
i do highly recommend slowly heating and cooling it to prevent cracking . 
no more running back to the office or home to check for orders . 
it grinds lots of spices at a time and grinds them perfectly . 
they do have a tendency to scratch rather easy . 
i love the variety in these cookie cutters . 
this is very thick and also very sharp . 
i just received this as a gift this week .

would give more stars if it did not . 
 one cup brown rice ,  two cups chicken broth ,  pinch salt . 
used these like they are going out of style .

its camera is pretty descent as far as cell phones go . 
their very easy to clean with no mess . 
that s where this wonderful set of knives comes in .

there is nothing to configure ,  but it is networking gear . 
and corelle has come a long way with these modern patterns . 
i had to learn this via a user submitted youtube video . 
i did not know what i was missing not having this scoop collection . 
this holder was the perfect size and is much stronger . 
i would like to add a review to this lcd screen protector .

the adapter works great and charges my extra battery with no problems . 
this was a great find since i have num_num of these vacuums . 
when you have a family ,  that is really really nice . 
the leather looks good and holds the case well . shipping is expensive . 
i really like this case ,  but the colors are very dark . 
works nice for every day in my kitchen . 
also if your recipe has some oil in it ,  that helps . 
a great product and received exactly how it was described . 
if you mess up at all ,  it ll deliver crap to you . 
many bagless vacs fall short in this area . 
the design in the back gives it a nice accent . 
i don t understand the physics of this but this does work . 
this was a great way to make my good gift awesome . 
so ,  we ve gone through a string of inexpensive waffle irons .

there is no seal whatsoever to keep the liquid in . 
i have never had a bad loaf come from this machine . 
it smoothes out icing nice ,  easy to wash ,  and simple design .

porbably only works for num_num ft which is still good . 
these are excellent ,  connected to my generic bt adapter with little effort . 
if you have never used a food processor ,  now is the time . 
the hand tools make it great for small jobs ,  too . 
seems to be as sturdy as it is attractive . 
they stack on top of each other and won t separate . 
b  the quality of oil and seasoning are questionable . 
the voice prompts for everything are very helpful . 
for more info on shun ,  check out alton brown s website . 
highly recommend to anyone with a kitchenaid stand mixer . 
fondue doesn t stick ,  quick temperature control and cleans easily . 
it suddenly began heating up until the heat made my ear very uncomfortable .

heats up pretty quick and keeps it warm . 
it works perfect juicing the oranges right down to the rine . 
of course the last one had major issues with the dropped reception . 
it s a great cable ,  especially for the price . 
i was looking for a middle of the road stainless steel pan set . 
spring prob wont last too long but have to wait and see . 
i like that the pot turns itself off after the cup has brewed . 
it works very well and i d recommend to anyone !  . 
also check calphalon s web site occasionally they have great sales . 
but you do notice num_num min later since you still have cold water . 
will certainly find more uses in days to come . 
and no problems with it getting stained or dirty or looking worn . 
it just sits in my suitcase until i need it . 
they last about a year and are pretty durable . 
turn off the heat as soon as done . 
they are much cheaper than the ones from sprint . 
the stoppers work great and can be thrown in the dishwasher between use .

i have to refill water almost twice a day for num_extend ft apartment . 
these cables do not have a long life . 
i went by the reviews and tried this blender . 
perfect for making coffee with a french press in my office . 
they never produced good palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless . 
bunn makes the best coffee machines ,  none can compare . 
the rubber seems to be of much higher quality . 
the good thing about this thermometer is that it requires no batteries . 
they work as needed and are the sizes called for in the rescepies . 
velcro is easily replaceable if the case holds up . 
this seems tightly held ,  but could potentially snag or pull off . 
plus it feels good in my hand and is weighted well . 
fit and finish is easily as good as original . 
it was super great it was cheaper than buying it directly from irobot . 
easy to take off to access the battery and cards . 
ease of cleaning is a huge plus for this blender .

this charge the iphone num_extend about half way . 
they came well wrapped and intact and are very solid pitchers . 
the wood is nice and smooth ,  it feels good in my hands .

like the previous reviewer ,  i owned a braun for over num_num yrs . 
the weight of the material makes it much better than the wood ones . 
the smaller size is perfect for num_num pcs of french toast or pancakes . 
these are great for keeping the smudges off your tablet or smartphone . 
he is looking forward to using this mixer for a long time . 
more for visual on the table or end result than practical . 
my household has this gf grill as well as a second larger one . 
it s a nice case and i have received many compliments on it . 
i hope this doesn t build up over time . 
in the old model it opened clockwise  viewed from above  . 
this is one of the best kitchen appliances i have ever bought .

no num_extend you can clean the pan in the dishwasher . 
i put it on the stove and burned the fibrox . 
i love how it has the extra usb for other chargers . 
i have fallen in love with le creuset over the past year . 
it is possible not to get good results with lack of experience . 
i have this same set in my home up north . 
i did a lot of researching on good cases . 
don t expect it to last much longer than stock . 
these are great ,  especially if you have a foodsaver vacuum appliance . 
i love how the cake turns out because of the aluminum . 
seems the plastic auger deteriorates over time and the juice along with it . 
definitely a must buy if your looking for an effective case . 
the num_extend one worked so well i bought another . 
and he is not necessarily gentle when it comes to technology . 
i love all the foodsaver accessories i have purchased . 
i only use my blender for smoothies nowadays . 
they feel like a fresh pedicure each and everytime . 
i was also influenced by consumer reports  evaluation . 
this spoon is well worth the cost even at list price . 
i recommend this press and think it is a great value . 
the apple interconnect plugs right in without any problem . 
no feet or notches to hold a bowl . 
it is great quality and a must in the kitchen .

was able to toss my rusty standby with confidence !  . 
i ve had this flatware for several years now . 
if you are using these for home use ,  they work pretty well . 
has the usual frustrations that come with putting screens on . 
they do not stain ,  melt ,  or degrade in any way . 
i don t think you could find a better buy . 
the holster protects my phone very well ,  while still providing easy access . 
you won t want to drop this ,  it s heavy . 
i own a full set ,  and keep buying more . 
good price for a set of sturdy pyrex storage pieces . 
i found that num_num tablespoon per cup of coffee is the best . 
i ve been going from phone to phone for quite some time now . 
it s in the glass and can t be removed . 
it does this not matter how much or little potato you add . 
we had our vacuum for two years before replacing this . 
the machine brews a good good cup of coffee in a reasonable time . 
they were extremely nice ,  and sent me a replacement right away . 
and the opening is num_extend easy to load and unload . 
started to peal off after a while and came off . 
and she no longer has to struggle with an old fashioned manual opener . 
they fit well ,  and the controls work well . 
i have this mounted to the back of my laundry door . 
the back has a num_num level led battery indicator . 
and for this price you can t go wrong .

works well to monitor the temperature in my fridge and freezer . 
clean up on these calphalon pans is a snap . 
we did and are very pleased with it . 
i ve had no problems at all with this . 
i ordered this for my traditional jelly roll pan and it fits perfectly . 
wash by hand and dry the parts immediately . 
all functions are controlled from the right earphone . 
the food doesn t sit flat on the metal and turn mushy . 
the only glitch is the brightness of the display . 
i read the other reviews and was skeptical to purchase . 
i can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands . 
these knives should always be washed immediately after use . 
i bought this little gem to bake my christmas cookies on . 
i might buy these as gifts for my sisters and friends . 
look to investing in more breadmaker cookbooks if you purchase this . 
the one advantage is that it is easier to clean . 
i sometimes lick the suction cup ,  so that s a suggestion . 
and i saw a review that chef n would replace it . 
this was an impulse purchase ,  but i use it almost every day . 
eventually it gets too gross to keep using . 
i use it to warm up my master bathroom in the morning . 
just sent it today but i m sure she will love it . 
the price is very reasonable and the product is a very good value . 
very nice little cookbook with loads of cast iron southern recipes . 
you can t beat that !  i will be ordering a new one .

i actually haven t owned a bluetooth headset for a number of years . 
i have been looking for something like this for a long time . 
this juicer is easy to use and does a great job of juicing .

my phone pairs to the gateway every time i start the car . 
it will easily fit in a purse or pocket . 
using the minimal amount of oil thought i d try a mister . 
this is a stylish design and a great coffee maker . 
i ordered this set as an extra set for our summer home . 
the water filters through and ends up in the pitcher . 
this filter fits perfectly as a replacement filter . 
if you don t mount it ,  it s too short . 
the best thing about this whisk is that the wires are not intertwined . 
will probably test product out before ordering next time . 
successive resharpening using num_extend and num_extend stage takes about num_num seconds . 
the oscillator works great and the fan even tilts all the way up . 
it hardly adds any additional girth to the phone at all . 
the description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene . 
it arrived yesterday and i immediately tested it . 
i added to my wish list before i saw that it was refurbished . 
the pan is very nice looking and cooks like a dream .

they were all in the trash bin long ago . 
we have been looking for the orange for oranges as a replacement .

mincing herbs and chili peppers come to mind .

i just wish these filters didn t cost so much . 
if you don t abuse it ,  it should last forever . 
also handy for simply keeping your lid out of the dirt . 
the battery lasts a full num_num hrs of talk time . 
coffee machine that was just too much trouble . 
the service is terrific and i recommend this grinder . 
plus ,  i had to spend money on the extra cable .

i highly recommend plugging it in before you sleep . 
i only wish it would have come sooner . 
this was given to my neice with num_num kids . 
this is a great toaster for my cinnamon toast addiction . 
it was a good case but i could be made better . 
i read a lot of the reviews of this before i bought it . 
i ve made four batches ,  over the last month or so . 
it is easy to use and cleans up very easily . 
this is like having a micro mini dish drain for canning lids . 
this battery makes this great phone only better . 
i use the bass booster function to get what seems best to me . 
these aren t fancy but do what they are made to do . 
the right length for grilling and they work well . 
it feels substantial in my hand and i enjoy writing with it . 
but i keep it in my bag and deal . 
they have been banged up pretty well since them . 
if you like a santoku another brand may be better for you . 
each bin holds about num_num num_extend or num_extend
it s just a little bit further away than i would like . 
it is wide enough to use my egg beater to whip cream . 
this cover helps you not to do that . 
it is useful gadget for a bread lover . 
i ve been making shortbread for over num_num years . 
mostly user error ,  but the quality could have been a little better . 
it inflates in under num_num seconds ,  and deflates just as quickly . 
still learning how to use this new kitchen tool . 
i had been looking for pastery sheets but they were so castly . 
i use this little grill for wax painting . 
it works great and was exciting to see the kids watch it . 
we think it worked better than the bissel we had . 
little things like the canister are easy to remove ,  clean and replace . 
then it would be a perfect bread machine . 
no problems at all as far as reliability ,  electrical ,  etc . 
i purchased num_num of these ,  for num_num iphones num_extend
both protects and helps you almost get trough the day without charging . 
the unit itself is made well ,  and easy to use . 
i drained my num_extend and ipad num_num to less than %
one warning is that many of these recipes use raw eggs . 
no more waiting for the coals to get hot . 
other times i ll use coconut oil and a bit of olive oil . 
i m still in pursuit of a  solid  stainless steel juicer . 
still using it to the day would def buy again . 
this won t work for larger batches of coffee . 
dishwashers are a huge waste of electricity and accomplish nothing . 
it s got a bit of mustard yellow to it . 
i bought it to use inside of my kitchen sink cabinet door . 
he sent me a set with the filters ,  etc . 
yes ,  i was suprised by how easy this can opener worked . 
has a nice sharp edge and cuts well . 
i ve only had pyrex measuring cups and plastic ones through the years . 
exactly the same as the battery that came with my phone . 
the design blades offer various choices in decorating . 
i ve used it twice and have no complaints . 
wife likes the bright color so she would not loose it easily . 
this case hands down is the best case i ve had . 
unlike some others ,  this model is a credit to the brand . 
very shiny ,  simple to put on ,  and sturdy . 
it holds the phone well in landscape and portrait mode . 
using these filters with the atlantis pitcher and i have no complaints . 
fast delivery ,  and the cradle is very convenient . 
i have only tested this as a charger ,  so far . 
i bought this blender used on craigslist for $
at the time ,  it was only available through mac knives . 
also ,  this is the best deal i have come across . 
it is magnetic bottom which tells me it is induction safe as well . 
this case looks great and has been pretty durable . 
they look great with my fine crystal wine glasses . 
the plastic is very scratch resistant and look brand new . 
it is a bit light but im sure it will work well . 
they are very durable and are well worth the money . 
i knew there had to be a better way . 
the touch buttons are a breeze to operate . 
nice little honing stick but i wish it were a bit longer . 
i imagine it is filled with solid epoxy or something very hard . 
it is lightweight ,  has great suction and is very easy to empty . 
just as stable as the oem samsung battery . 
 when i dump water i dump it on veggies or flowers  . 
we have large fry pans and and dutch ovens . 
i had an incase previously and protected better but it was wearing out . 
but anyway ,  even i can use this thing . 
it s a beautiful case and has front protection too . 
i have had no warping or problems with the finish . 
one star off for not being made in the usa . 
i have it suctioned to a beanbag type mount . 
it does exactly as advertised and saved me money . 
highest recommendation for lc in general and this pan in particular . 
flexible and the handle fits nicely in the palm . 
the color is very bright and lovely to look at . 
if you have never used corelle ,  make sure you get a set . 
if it is from oxo for the kitchen i am all for it . 
once they are on they work great . buy these . 
 look up the product here on amazon . com for more info  . 
definitely a good value and buy on this . 
i trust a  real  one with real numbers . 
it is small and light weight and takes up no space . 
love the seal on this keeping germs out . 
my kitchen sports num_num magnetic knife holders filled with expensive knives . 
this is the second one of these i have had . 
led glows to help one locate this at night . 
i sterilized the jar and a spoon in boiling water . 
has never fallen off my frig via magnet . 
it is so nice in your hands ,  love oxo !  . 
the chef s knife has a nice weight to it . 
my nine year old has no trouble using it . 
the bases are weighted ,  so they sit solidly on a flat surface . 
this is my third blender in the past num_num years . 
often you ll find it cheaper ,  and sometimes with free shipping . 
this is a good item but i hate to keep buying them . 
i use them whenever i make a cake or similar . 
i was a little leary about buying this pan . 
if you need to can then you would def . 
the card will work with many other types of cell phones as well . 
this case would impress the hard to please teen . 
new batteries again ,  and finally saw a flicker . 
the holster is cool ,  but i never really use it . 
again ,  this is even better than it s advertising says it is . 
i use it for everything ,  and it has never failed me . 
rice is not the only thing you can make in it . 
with this pan i get a nice tall bread . 
with the earloop ,  however ,  i could barely hear the unit . 
simple to use and does as it was designed to do . 
it has performed way beyond my thoughts of how well it would work . 
also never scrub it ,  wash with a little soap and soft sponge . 
the blade shape and overall balance make it a joy to work with . 
i usually compromise and use this popper to make healthier popcorn . 
it works just as expected if you re expecting convenience . 
we gave it to my father for christmas . 
i really don t have any previous models to base it on . 
i really like anker s chargers because they are very universal . 
this has been a great addition to my travel accessories . 
this whisk is the first one out of the drawer for the task . 
i now use them mainly as stoppers and pop them off to pour . 
this thing is indeed extremely heavy and the helper handle is indeed helpful . 
i purchased otter case for my num_extend which was designed for num_extend
i look forward to findingexperiencing the quality of this product . 
amazon had the best price by far than any other dealer anywhere . 
just a dab but enough to make it slippery . 
the device around the neck takes a little to get used to . 
so ,  aside from nokia compatibility ,  still no complaints . 
the little nub on the handle is also a nice feature . 
but other than those two things ,  it does charge my phone . 
i bake pizza on this stone once a week . 
the shipment came in over a week early . 
at this price ,  you can have a charger in every room . 
i don t think it should  or could  be placed in the dishwasher . 
but the lid  sold separately  doesn t fit perfectly . 
it seems to have minimal scratching and still appears clear . 
i would be lost without these easy on ,  easy off twist caps . 
the photos of the cases do not do them justice . 
makes more coffee than most ,  which is a good thing . 
i use it a lot to clean up the misses in the bathroom . 
quality made and ease of use and set up . 
i had a model similar to this one that lasted around num_num years . 
i have found the measures are not precise though . 
i sometimes make a seasoning mix to freeze . 
i have it sharpened about once a year . 
i bought several to try them out and see which i liked best . 
don t waste your money on an expensive roaster . 
i purchased this charger because you can never have enough back up . 
i have eight ,  a mixture of the fine and coarse mills . 
unless you step on it or intentionally try to break it . 
i am so grateful to the reviewers who wrote about this product . 
the call reception has been clear and virtually distortion free . 
this grill pan is just perfect for on the stove grilling . 
my original battery wasnt holding a charge anymore . 
that s to maintain the edges of fiskars axes ,  etc . 
i can confirm that those two work fine . 
i bought this for lasagna and serving from casserole dishes . 
but ,  frankly ,  these measuring spoons are made to last !  . 
we purchased similar ones for our other cars . 
its not like the phone is never going to be outdated or replaced . 
i purposely kept my phone on battery until it got low . 
it s easy to clean and easy to store . 
the large size prevents my pasta from sticking and gives it plenty room . 
however ,  i bet many people just need to clean their grinder out . 
we use this almost every day and it works great . 
now ,  gotta get back to drinking my espresso . 
they make using your device a much better experience . 
it works really well  it is my second one  . 
its quite simple to use and very handy in times of wobbly trouble . 
the rubberized grip surrounding the center provides a comfortable and secure num_extend
i think the coffee tastes much better when dripped through a paper filter . 
when it becomes a problem ,  i will definitely consider purchasing this armband . 
big ,  classic shape ,  and perfect for everyday or diner parties . 
they have great sound and are very comfortable . 
i have used it both with my computer  sony vaio  and motorola razr . 
i have bought at least half a dozen cases for my num_extend
frenchfries are better; the toast and bagels are terrific . 
bought this for the wife and she loves it ,  it works great . 
i have always had excellent experience with pyrex . 
i haven t used it much yet but so far so good . 
ordered this for my grandmothers phone and know she is rocking and rolling . 
i do like the box and that is is not too bullky . 
i have nothing but good things to say about this cleaner . 
overall ,  a great design and it works well . 
messy pan and spashes all over the oven . 
not only is it a more attractive unit ,  it s quieter . 
the design and material of the case iselegant and well thought out . 
i have been an igo user for many years . 
pour in juice ,  freeze num_num minutes or until slushy . 
i looked around and lodge has the best price . 
es como una laptop en la palma de tu mano . 
we suggest adding a portable ozonator to help keep up the filter . 
i bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking . 
it is heavy duty ,  and has never failed me yet . 
i just add num_num more tablespoon of coffee and drink the grit . 
purchased a few of these and have only had one problem . 
it is attractive and the brushed finish matches our big appliances . 
the phones work fine ,  no problem activating them . 
that s probably the one thing i didn t like about this . 
it stores easy and works great ,  and it was a great price . 
they are perfect to bake sweet and savoury pies . 
nothing wrong with its cooking time or performance at all . 
other than that it seems be sharp and easy to handle . 
it performs the same and is just as beautiful so who cares . 
as usual ,  oxo has made an excellent product . 
i had an otterbox before but it was just to huge . 
i use sony ericsson bluetooth for years until i got this one . 
google navigator for turn by turn gps function num_extend
it is somewhat messy ,  but it does the job . 
i haven t tried to wash or clean it yet . 
we love our bunn brewer  actually on the second one . 
i had to use a hand mixer for the second . 
it s a must have for any kitchen hands down . 
i use my android phone for everything from music to navigation . 
i was them in the dishwasher without any problems . 
both were not truly nonstick and cuisinart has a titanium coating . 
it doesn t take up a lot of space on the counter . 
i am extremely happy with these cutting boards . 
i change my rating from num_num stars to num_num stars . 
i bought this as a christmas present to myself last year . 
i have nothing but positive things to say about it . 
if this is what your needs are ,  then ,  look no further . 
a very good headset for my motorola android phone . 
i cannot say enough good things about this case . 
the smell is quite minimal with this kind of upkeep . 
you put this in your car and charge your phone on the go . 
takes a few minutes after the ready light goes on to reach temp . 
i use it to cut veggies and meat . 
i was excited to get my ar drone . 
it makes good ,  hot coffee and has been reliable . 
it works pretty well across all the platforms . 
i love all the different grating options on each side . 
it will be the last scoop you buy . 
but this is what you get for a universal type charger . 
highly recommend this product to any and all phone owners !  . 
it steams great and works almost like an iron . 
love fiesta and have a lot of it . 
smudges seems to be easy to handle also . 
absolutely perfect ,  just as advertised !  easy to place on . 
all in all ,  it s the easiest way to make poached eggs . 
what a great addition to our calphalon collection . 
i ve been using the chef s choice for years now . 
makes the best fried eggs and fried rice . 
i ve never had a problem with getting the grease off either . 
its good battery and its gives you extended juice . 
it seems to help make them more uniform in shape and profile . 
the ease of clean up is amazing as well . 
this has a permanent place on our stove top . 
it also looks really ugly on white iphones . 
i use mine on a daily basis and hone it ocassionally . 
i havent even been able to use the whole pack yet . 
however ,  i ve bought several packs and use them allllll the time . 
i am very happy to have a new one . 
this is a basic rubber case that does the job . 
primarily ,  i like to make my own pizza sauce with it . 
i just ordered another grinder just for my spices . 
when choosing colors they are also all different prices . 
these are all of these at a wonderful price . 
neither of these problems occur with this one . 
i like that it is white so blends in with my white door . 
just make sure you get the right seeds . 
the pattern is a little more modern than the standard flower corelle pattern . 
i needed one fruit bowl in this color and bought . 
in fact ,  when i opened the box one was broken . 
i bought it for my bf and he loved it !  amazing price . 
i couldn t understand how to turn the led light on . 
the arrived quickly ,  well packaged and just as pictured . 
other than this ,  i expect a long time of protection for my num_extend
and talk about a machine that makes an awesome espresso or cappuccino . 
i ve owned and used this product for at least two years . 
this was a cheap charger and works great . 
i use my phone pretty much all day long . 
i have used it innumerable number of times . 
this is a great pot if you know what you are getting . 
just slip out the old tube and slip on a new one . 
i filled it once ,  dumped it out ,  and filled it again . 
although the most standard is to put strawberrys and whip cream on them . 
when one goes you still have the two . 
when i put this on ,  it s slightly bulkier but who cares . 
i hand wash the stamp when i am done using it . 
i bought this to juice my wheat grass and it works well . 
the owner s guide specifically gave instructions on how to juice thin greens . 
i love my iphone and use it constantly . 
different and good once you adjust to how it fits on the can . 
seems to be fairly well built for this type of product . 
she tells me that it is performing well . 
you will not be sorry you bought this . 
for a basic phone ,  this has a lot of features . 
i previously used a kettle on the stove to heat the water . 
the instructions were easy to follow and it assembled very easily . 
this is a perfect case for the iphone num_extend
i will try later on this week on making raw soup with it . 
i have had this timer for maybe num_num years . 
if i could give it num_num stars i would . 
all that time the other vacuum wasn t get close to clean . 
but i left the massage to the seller . 
i have been using these for about num_num years now . 
we love the fact that this machine is sturdy and makes great coffee . 
all clad happens to be my all time choice for cookware . 
i do not know why i did not buy this before . 
nokia may formally allow user to download and install the east asian fonts . 
this replaces a cheapie i bought at ikea . 
made in the usa ,  heavy duty in my opinion . 
voice menus talk the wearer through battery levels ,  connections and caller ids . 
i serve our family of num_num in them . 
it s a high end iron for a middle of the road price . 
i have an electrolux canister vacuum that i love . 
each morning while the water is heating i grind the coffee . 
i don t store a lot of music or pictures on my num_extend
but for me this size is just fine . 
the food was very hot when i was done . 
it pours cleanly and is easy to clean . 
the fine one is my preferred potato mashing disc . 
getting lots of use and haven t needed to be sharpened yet . 
these fit the ticket at a very reasonable price . 
they are even heating and easy to clean . 
broke the glass in my evo and replaced it . 
french press coffee should be discarded after num_num minutes or so . 
i used this with my tagine for cooking and it works wonderfully . 
both screens are breathtaking in their brightness ,  clarity and resolution . 
easy to use ,  simple clean up ,  and finger saving . 
sound of bose is super ,  battery life though disappointing . 
based on the reviews ,  i decided to give it a try . 
i ve had this sharpener for at least num_num years . 
i use num_extend bamboo spoons and they lay flat . 
the temp options are num_extend num_extend num_extend num_num and num_extend
unfortunately they are less than adequate as gym socks . 
i have had my own for num_num years without missing a beat . 
it is extremely well made and has been a star performer . 
i actually paid $ so i am one happy customer !  . 
this press makes that much easier to do . 
this toaster oven is much better than those of num_num years ago . 
very nice for such a variety of users . 
it saves me from cleaning up a skillet or dutch oven . 
but everything else is cool  !  i would recommend . 
in my opinion they are a good value . 
this is a fine egg cooker for a number of reasons . 
it keeps them safe and my hands safe from the sharp blades . 
this is a well made and great looking measuring cup . 
its special ingredient is a packet of dry yeast . 
this pan will become a valued partner in the kitchen . 
i liked the knife so much that i bought another . 
i had a eureka mighty mite years ago . 
 nothing but problems i saw this one on amazon and ordered it . 
it s hard to believe they re a children s set ,  frankly . 
tough enough to survive both my gadget drawer and taken on camping trips . 
these would also be great for organizing accessories like purses . 
oh ,  also a better way to wrap the cord would be beneficial . 
would recommend if needing the difference sizes for whisking a food product . 
it neutralizes the acids and the stains literally strip away from stainless steel . 
the small grooves supposedly make it so the vegetables do not stick . 
this one actually fits and is rigid enough to stay on the phone . 
much better than the hooks they come with originally . 
needless to say i needed some heavy duty suction power . 
i love the fact that it has a raised edge on the side . 
slips on and off easily and the cutouts are perfect . 
the cardboard is nice and thick and can withstand a heavy cake . 
a good idea but a little awkward to use . 
i am glad that amazon carries things like this . 
its not perfect ,  but nothing can be made for everyone . 
this phone is amazing after the ics upgrade . 
i sanded down the top and edges to clean up the knife marks . 
this is a ergonomic and easy to clean garlic press . 
i bought this to get over the limit for free shipping . 
it worked great on my sony android phone . 
i m able to hang up to num_num on one hook . 
again ,  this was a problem with my plantronics . 
overall a great vaccum at a bargain price . 
the device suctions onto my counter top with impressive force . 
i am very pleased about how the delivery . 
it is a very nice knife with a comfortable handle . 
this is a machine we will also be giving as a gift . 
a little searing on the ridges ,  burnt fat . 
 :  the blending ability of this unit is really something else . 
love the soft finish and the gray color . 
it is a remarkable tool that i thoroughly enjoy using . 
we purchased this as an alternative for more expensive breville own pizza stone . 
especially as i am not aware of the arctic brand . 
so ,  this seller seems to be quite good . 
the directions are excellent and the product works as described . 
people can hear me just fine in the car . 
there was no click or anything like that . 
i m reading into this as simply a defective product or poor installation . 
feels like an old friend to measure or to scramble eggs . 
this gets so much use at my house . 
it charges and the data connect works too . 
i don t even use a case just slide it into my pocket . 
i feel sure it would be an appreciated addition to the main gift . 
bought as a gift for a friend who loves fresh fruit juice . 
but i had a pretty good experience testing out this etymotic research headset . 
smooth easy operation and the blades work perfectly . 
works great to answer calls and its totally iphone compatible . 
would definately buy again if another is needed . 
i filled them up using a turkey baster . 
it doesn t mess up my screen protector on the edges . 
the glass bowls are heavy too and not at all fragile . 
love the three size set in different colors . 
love this addition to make my baths more enjoyable . 
yet ,  it is far from merely being a storage bottle . 
i have owned a lot of battery packs . 
now i m convinced it was worth the price . 
but these have stuck really well so far . 
but the price i paid for this product which is also not high . 
i was very pleased with these cooling racks . 
the feel and action of the protector changes the way you phone feels . 
a must have item if you like poached eggs . 
the lodge dutch oven is the perfect place to start . 
its the same type that many android phones use to charge . 
it was in my hands num_num days after placing the order . 
i say ,  get this phone ,  and go for a cheap gsm num_extend
quality is first rate and no issues of any kind . 
the chef s choice met these conditions and more . 
this product worked very well in my tub . 
others have noted the handles tend to bend . 
it fits the iphone num_extend like a glove . 
the entire unit is quality and is not flimsy or light weight . 
getting it on and off is a real pain . 
i can live with a few kernels in the microwave . 
there are two size mounts for taller speakers . 
its flaps are not staying in as they are supposed to . 
buy this mixer and enjoy all your home made goodies . 
i have used russet potatoes ,  and yukon gold . 
the mm wipes clean with a damp paper towel . 
this little wrought iron coaster holder is inexpensive but attractive . 
that said the sound in these headsets were amazing . 
not a big deal ,  but a little disappointing . 
you never have to worry if you should forget to turn it off . 
best of all ,  the thing is reasonably priced !  a solid investment . 
about num_num hours per day talk time is all you get . 
the coating seems like it will last a long time . 
this has not been so for some skillets i ve owned . 
just keep pumping until you hear the clicking and it s closed . 
the case is soft to the touch and durable . 
the stylus feels like quality and has cool styling to match . 
i also ordered the new blue clarins filters also a great value here . 
if you can afford it ,  get this one . 
the new one fits nicely and recharges fine . 
did not work at first and technical support solved the problem . 
maybe i should have ordered the num_extend pan instead of the num_extend pan . 
you ll get a workout too ,  so another plus . 
it is a very nice fan ,  and i really enjoy it !  . 
theclip unfolds to enable viewing a youtube video with ease . 
it reconnects quickly when brought back into range . 
the price was right as well as compared with the grocery store . 
like most other droid users battery issues are rampant . 
overall i would definitely buy this case again . 
a great tool is something that simplifies even the most mundane of tasks . 
actually ,  what did it in was my feeble attempt to clean it . 
i don t like to boil water or other liquids inside . 
as one reviewer put it and i agree . 
it just feels unnatural eating a triangular egg . 
again ,  this is not an issue for me . 
she uses it all the time to take pictures of herself under water . 
slowly turn on the valve on the filter head . 
this is light enough that i can carry it around . 
i wish the ear pieces fit a little better than they do . 
i especially love the brush aluminum shell ,  and the packaging is professional . 
this headset is very comfortable ,  like any other . 
it has cleaned up very well which was a wonderful surprise . 
good lenght and ,  obviously ,  very easy to plug and play . 
two of them are braun num_extend one white ,  one black . 
nicely weighted ,  but not overbearing on the wrist . 
it does a great job in the car ,  and around my shop . 
this is my num_extend oj juicer in num_num yrs . 
downfall was the opening to insert the headset jack was too narrow . 
you get a num_num ounce bottle with the steamvac . 
i can live with that considering the price i paid . 
these are the best this is my second set . 
it ground coffee pretty well but the timer was grossly inaccurate . 
the microphone is built into left side of headset . 
i ve used this popper almost daily since i ve bought it . 
virgin mobile s phones operate on their parent company ,  sprint s network . 
these flexible cutting boards do exactly what i purchased them to num_extend
i even have an otterbox case on my ipad . 
the stainless steel is easy to work with and clean . 
all of a sudden i was holding a completely different phone . 
the size is perfect for covering larger dinner plates . 
i charged it fully when it first num_extend
this case looks just like the picture and is very pretty . 
didn t think it would work but works great !  . 
it s very pretty ,  looks great in my kitchen . 
well ,  this unit works just fine for me . 
let all other parts dry completely after cleaning . 
cooks quickly and everly and cleans up very easily . 
great for just a light coat of oil and whatever . 
it catches a bunch of small dust that the bag doesn t catch . 
are you going to play games with it ?  ?  most likely not . 
i will update this review at a later time . 
it makes very little difference from what i can tell . 
the first batch was fettuccine that i served with a cheesy alfredo sauce . 
verizon sold num_num for $ and i bought these num_num for $
if that last sentence made you a little worried ,  don t be . 
the hamilton barely even touched the the pills but the krups was great . 
couldn t ask for more and they were prime so i was happy . 
looks very nice if you have a white iphone . 
i don t want anyone else to have a stroke too . 
the product is also reasonable protection for the phone itself . 
and ,  as others have noted ,  the price is amazing . 
i like these screen protectors there unnoticeable and not easy to scratch up . 
this household will never see boxed pasta again . 
this product is wonderful for scrambled eggs and other light and soft items . 
medium heat is the key to perfect popcorn . 
just something for storing things in the cabinet . 
i bought two more for my kids ,  they love it . 
it is very quiet and has excellent safety festures . 
it is so heavy that oftentimes i pass on using it . 
they are a good substitute for the high end glasses . 
however putting them on is a bit hard . 
the one that broke was just a flat piece of fired clay . 
i am comfortable with my two sons operating this as well . 
it worked well with the hoover platinum collection solution . 
i bought one for my vizio tablet and loved the construction of it . 
it will hold num_num to num_num average sized spice bottles . 
not a lot to say ,  it works exactly like it should . 
i think this is the best size i think . 
i bought this case for my wireless headset ,  for my gym bag . 
this would have been the second one i ve purchased . 
product arrived on time and was well packaged . 
it is a good spoon rest at the stove . 
the capresso num_extend infinity burr grinder has held up well over the years . 
i can apple slices and dehydrate them too . 
still ,  most files do play and very nicely . 
i measured my stove ,  specifically across the num_num burners before ordering . 
took it along with the rest and put under her tree last sat . 
i agree that this product takes some getting used to . 
beats paying the same amount for just one . 
why it needs to be reset ,  i am not sure . 
i use the plastic knob from the top of the pot . 
i have yet to use these until the battery is depleted . 
it seems to move num_num or num_num times the air . 
very nice looking and sturdy case for my iphone . 
i would say that the results are almost restaurant quality . 
there s no glare and it won t scratch up . 
comes direct from amazon and quality seems to be good . 
not that it is really great ,  and not that it is awful . 
i have been replacing everything in my kitchen with the fiesta pieces . 
you can t slice things on a rippled surface . 
a british voice announced the incoming phone number . 
is still shiny after decades of hard num_extend
use these as much or more than quart bags . 
dig into your savings and buy a decent corkscrew for a change . 
these are for the kitchen and the other for the dining room . 
they are accurate to pick up small pieces . 
it was hard to keep the food and snacks in one place . 
easy to fill small portions as well as big ones . 
i really like the feel of this case . 
finally i was able to find another one . 
i ve cooked in professional kitchens and this pan is commercial cook where . 
when they came ,  i got my baking book and got to work . 
gives a classy look and i m getting lots of compliments on it . 
good looks and protection ,  also very easy to use . 
but ,  for the price ,  i m quite happy with it . 
i bought it at walmart where they had it on clearance for $
it s the perfect size for left over stews etc . 
you don t know the power of the master chef . 
i purchased this little set of pans along with the cuisnart toaster oven . 
it s not quite as simple as the volume adjustment but easy nonetheless . 
just add the water and let it do it s thing . 
it s practical ,  well made and easy to clean . 
it is well worth the price for it . 
i got this for myself ,  for a single person apt . 
it s designed to fit any size arm ,  it is easily adjustable . 
the case comes to your house ,  you snap it on and . 
i have num_num machines so this will be a good value for me . 
i love the design as well !  recommendations are in order !  . 
because nothing sticks to them ,  they are easy to clean . 
so my statement about it being a great car mount still stands . 
works great with bb bold num_extend bb original . 
don t be distracted by the thought this is only good for cookies . 
i found this set a good value so i purchased it . 
sauce pan for something else or the high sides would be awkward . 
this is the best small crock pot with the most features available . 
fantastic product and highly recommend as a replacement to old worn batteries . 
i don t know what i d do without them . 
great to have in the closet for all my present making supplies . 
can also be used as a strainer in a pinch . 
i like the slimmer design of the silicone vs . 
i also bought great party fondues book by peggy fallon with it . 
it s much cheaper ,  and works just as well . 
i previously bought protectors for other cell phones from best buy . 
then i ordered this one for my feet below the computer . 
the plastic parts melted and burst into blue flames . 
i don t care if it says it can do carpets . 
easy to clean and great to use all the time . 
i have an iphone num_extend with which it paired at once . 
i bought this on sale and was pleased to see that it works . 
these were a very good price during the past christmas shopping season . 
the plastic texture seems to be a scratch resistant plastic with matte finish . 
now i need another one just to keep in the kitchen . 
buy it; but only if you need one . 
it gives the phone style and i enjoyed it . 
if only the end result was just a bit hotter . 
i have used warmrails for num_num years and have been totally satisfied . 
we make bread and also love its dough mixing feature . 
you can get this thing any way you want . 
great buy at $ and lives up to wusthof quality and simplicity . 
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
i was afraid to use sticks that said they were for crafts vs . 
wish this one was cheaper ,  but no complaints of any kind . 
not the end of the world but a little inconvenient . 
apple would charge you an arm and a leg for this . 
imagine my disappointment upon discovering their utensils have been outsourced to china . 
this is a nice pan ,  but num_num num_extend
i have not had this problem at all . 
plenty of steam to last for an hour of cleaning . 
the meat in its fresh state was hard to work with . 
get it if you need a case to protect your phone . 
great job and i would recommend this product highly . 
stuck in the cold meat it registers it as done . 
and the water would get cold pretty quickly . 
nice sized pot rack fit perfectly over my new sink . 
update :  after several motnhs of use ,  this unit is working great . 
this is one of many that i have bought on short notice . 
its much easier to use and most important . 
mine says kenwood ,  but it is the same machine . 
this henckels set meets all of our criteria . 
i like the lid .  .  . food cooks quicker that way . 
it does what a food tray is supposed to do . 
the political commentary on germany of one reviewer notwithstanding ,  this thing works . 
its entirely useless i ll admit ,  but amazingly cool nevertheless . 
i was prepared for the oasis to be equally frustrating . 
each recipe i ve tried has come out perfect . 
now i don t need to use a pan to cook the burgers . 
i love how the cord winds up into the bottom of the unit . 
fun color and works just fine with my num_extend
it is well constructed and the flat bottom helps the roasting process well . 
i make popcorn using peanut oil and i use a gourmet popcorn . 
he knows i like making my own lattes . 
the price that i bought it for was great . 
what can you say about twine ?  it is very handy . 
a liberal application of nonstick spray keeps eggs from sticking to rings . 
i like using it instead of getting fingerprints all over my touch devices . 
for what it is ,  it s on the expensive side . 
my screen still looks brand new because of these protectors !  !  . 
others may prefer the aeron ,  i know i liked it . 
does not look big and bulky like most cases . 
the slider and can are sturdy and easy to use . 
easy to assemble ,  and it holds a good amount of pasta . 
easy to handle and easy on my old arthritic wrist . 
it charges to full power overnight from fully drained . 
i don t think you can go worn with this one . 
this will work for any size or shape of knife . 
the machine has nothing to do with any of this . 
still ,  it dried faster and nicer than with a regular towel . 
otherwise i would not have heard statement num_extend
i just really appreciate the style and quality of these cups . 
when i put it in my phone it was also fine . 
i finally bought it because the price was right . 
she loves the color red ,  so it was a perfect choice . 
i would highly recommend this thermos to everyone . 
i m very pleased with the fit of this skin . 
you can find a more complete review on the zo mini product page . 
i recently ordered this knife sharpener as a gift for my son . 
be sure to read and follow the instructions to the  t  . 
your ice cream will be a trouble free gourmet quality ice cream experience . 
this is a great addition to the kitchen . 
the item was perfect fit replacement for my wife s lost back door . 
i suggest it if you are looking for one . 
this is my second purchase for this pan . 
the handle grip is comfortable and the whisks themselves are durable . 
the model number i am reviewing is the num_extend
it s the third one i ve tried with my iphone num_extend
my wife says the quick cook settings actually makes better rice . 
they work well and i am happy with this one . charles . 
i purchased it as a gift and they are happy with it . 
they cut the meat and don t tear it . 
at the pricepoint ,  the krups is a great deal . 
i love it and will buy it again when this one wears out . 
i went to the local kitchen store to get a replacement . 
it is very light weight and stays on my ear . 
i love the fact that this is made in the usa . 
plates take up a lot of room but you can stack with pyrex . 
and they cost a fraction of the price in verizon . 
sometimes the clear screen protectors can get a little sticky . 
the entire face is exposed and there is no cushioning power . 
each rack holds a few loaves  i have two  . 
i purchased and review only the round one with corner and bottom openings . 
that will eliminate splatter and keeps your microwave clean . 
the shape of the loaf is really a traditional shape . 
i ordered it on sunday and received it today from amazon . 
but this doesn t affect my review of the num_extend
first off ,  i ve never owned a cast iron skillet . 
the software version i received on the phone purchased in february num_num is num_extend
this works with the htc incredible num_extend but isn t a perfect fit . 
the accuracy depends on your tablet .  . not the pen itself . 
al .  ,  i ll put servings into these cups and freeze . 
the screw top cup works well too and is a perfect size . 
and the difficultly of finding anything but the general purpose filters in stores . 
i ve brewed some kits from brooklyn brew shop  available here on amazon  . 
i bought this for my husband ,  who loves peanut butter . 
the phone cover fit perfectly on my phone . 
this is the one i use all the time . 
easy to take off to clean the num_extend
i have had a farberware double boiler since the late num_extend
will definitely purchase another one when the time comes . 
we have been using these types of espresso makers for decades . 
i got my green roomba for christmas last year num_extend
okay the incredible is an old android at this point . 
some tips do not come with the set . 
i would order from them again with confidence in their promise . 
for $ you are getting a charger and a cable . 
i barely got num_num use out of it before it just conked out . 
it works great and sure helps my arthritic hands . 
i m a minimalist and i try to carry as little as possible . 
not much to say that hasn t been said already . 
black and decker has a super winner here . 
suggest adding a watery sauce to the dish to help . 
i think that this is going to work out just great . 
it does not pretend to be a high end cookie press . 
i just received my muffin magic this afternoon . 
however ,  the blade is a little on the small side . 
it cleans my tile and wood floors beautifully before i mop . 
i am happy with the product over all . 
have used this coffee maker for several years . 
i have used this french fry cutter numerous times without any problems . 
now my children want me to order one for our house . 
the handle isn t as cool  gets hot  as the old one . 
i would not recommend purposely submerging your phone in water with this case . 
this steel has been a very good purchase . 
the only thing i wish is the battery would last a hair longer . 
the blade seems a bit safer and easier to handle for cleaning . 
those car navigation systems that use a cd are so stupid . 
no signs of falling apart any time soon . 
i bought this for my brother for christmas . 
nice convienent ,  plugs in correctly to my i num_extend
the ends haven t degraded noticeably ,  still providing a reliable charge . 
this board is our old friend these num_num years ,  at least . 
if you don t like it ,  just leave it num_extend
nothing works as well as foodsaver bags for your foodsaver vacuum sealer . 
that is four pair and all of us love them . 
num_extend there is ample space to hold liquid soap . 
it is hard to find these little things in the dept . 
this little pan insert is great and easy to use . 
i love mine ,  though ,  and will never buy any other brand . 
they have retained their sharp edge and perform very well . 
may need to purchase one for smaller cakes . 
let me start by saying that i love this little machine . 
i have several recipes posted using this pan . 
my first blackberry was a num_num back in num_num on verizon . 
she loves it and uses it for more then just coffee beans . 
this is a nice thick board for a good price . 
i can t rave enough about switching over to hard anodized cookware . 
they are a perfect addition to any kitchen !  . 
this pizzelle baker is so much fun ,  and easy to use . 
i was very satisfied with it and the tear off thing worked great . 
i like the numerous features on this charger . 
slide your finger up ,  and the volume rises . 
we replaced our very messy tupperware draw with this set . 
my kitchen couldn t operate without my cast iron cookware . 
maximizes precious oven space when i bake several loaves of bread . 
however ,  the repairs are not really noticeable as they are small . 
its small and easy to store away and the functions are easy . 
i like the all stainless version of this grater . 
i always look for oxo before purchasing other brushes or kitchen items . 
this baby will take care of that for you . 
they roll as smooth as butter and are quiet . 
okay ,  i am going to give it a very very small nudge . 
both a few other ones and was not very satisfied with the quality . 
the sound and clarity are about three steps above my old headset . 
i live in nyc ,  and as everyone knows its noisy here . 
i starting experimenting with loose teas but did not like the mess . 
great for straining grease after frying and resaving it for another time . 
cause i m not going to pay anywhere near $ for num_extend
there is no way you will find a deal like this anywhere else . 
it s only happened once ,  but it was a mess . 
my coffee maker is collecting dust now after using this awesome thing . 
flip it over and you can chop veggies on it all day . 
no parts breaking or falling off ,  as some have experienced . 
it has become my favorite skillet ,  even over my cast iron . 
i mean straight out of the box perfect . 
these i wanted for leftovers ,  or to microwave . 
all in all ,  a good screen protector for the iphone num_extend
not an attractive way to display your knives ,  and potentially hazardous . 
easy to clean ,  deep enough for tall items . 
i keep in mine in the bottom of my half sheet pans . 
i do love this on the white iphone as it looks sharp . 
this isn t always the case with some other bb s . 
that being said ,  i am not against better mousetraps . 
seems durable plus its a life time free replacement . 
i just wanted a base line type phone with no web surfing . 
this product cuts through shortening and butter easily . 
however ,  my bacon comes out fast and yummy . 
price on amazon was great at less than $
it works as a head unit in my car . 
i bake a lot of bread ,  but hav not tried any yet . 
i believe this issue willremedy itself with regular use . 
a cool design on the back enhances the appearance there . 
however ,  my husband loves the new lapis color the best . 
i ve had no problems and i think they are great !  . 
it cooks the best chicken and leg of lamb ever . 
perfect product and i am so glad that i purchased this . 
the rubber feet at the bottom work great to prevent movement . 
just add coffee and water and push a button and your done . 
we all have apple earbuds lying around somewhere . 
i was very pleased with the quality of this product . 
they are extremely lightweight and feel natural when worn . 
water heats up to boiling in num_num minutes if the kettle is full . 
the cell apple iphone num_num  black  num_extend  factory unlocked  was very good . 
could do without the blue light but not the end of the world . 
i bought a made in usa and had to return it . 
they are made extremely well to take that amount of work . 
i you want a num_num gallon can ,  go for it !  . 
the phone is totally white ,  which i love !  . 
this means i can only use this device to place or receive calls . 
the kitchenaid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect . 
have my voice fades away but now no one complains . 
sometimes you get more than you pay for . 
still a couple more days before the release of the num_extend
i will update this review if i hear of any issues with it . 
the issue with just covering the dishes is storage in the fridge . 
the unit paired immediately and simply with my motorola droid phone  running android num_extend
ive had one fail on my motorola xoom tablet . 
pairing the device and set up took seconds and was easy . 
it comes with a really great instruction book with recipes included . 
i m just upset that i have to return it . 
its very shiny but doesnt get all greasy and dirty from my hands . 
i never wash my metal pans in the dishwasher . p . s . 
i originally paid $ for a screen protector from another company . 
and the thermal carafe on this machine keep the coffee hot for hours . 
i purchased one and then a few weeks later lost it . 
my only gripe is the num_num cup really isn t big enough . 
this is very handy since you can use it indoors or out . 
it really helps when you have small amounts to whisk !  . 
i can find a lot of uses for these and my camera equipment . 
i also warm up other frozen snacks and it does a wonderful job . 
but otherwise great !  i need to type seven more words apparently . 
no delamination ,  no deforming ,  just some discoloration and carbon marks . 
it is a perfect fit with the antenna on the treo num_num or num_extend
it s like a part of my body now . 
at home ,  in quiet room ,  the bass might be overpowering . 
it s as if they had a different product . 
bought it for a gift for my husband ,  he loves it . 
instead you have to pack them around with you . 
the only problem is i ended breaking it lol i m to rough . 
the screen protector fit great and looks good . 
update :  i originally purchased this in november num_extend
first of all ,  i had a num_num oz . 
i love deep fried foods and this unit performs very well . 
it s subtle ,  takes no space ,  and it works . 
i do not see anything difference in any chargers . 
nice clear screen even in the out num_extend
this allows me to do that right in the can under the faucet . 
hope that they last as long as the current iphone . 
but i am so far very happy with these canisters . 
now made in china instead of the usa . 
i know i will be using much more garlic in the future !  . 
i am late to the game on salad spinners . 
it will amaze people how you play your music wirelessly . 
we have a golden retriever so lots of dog fur hits the rug . 
this is a device you will wonder how you got along without it . 
i have one of these and it s many ,  years old . 
keeping it out of the dishwasher is the way to make it last . 
microwave for num_num mins and a perfect result comes out . 
and ,  they look so much better than my old ones . 
i take my spare battery to outdoor events . 
these pans and liners fit perfectly in my countertop oven . 
i have had no issues with poor suction . 
so i can t compare this one to any other . 
used knife to cut the guaze in half . 
great supplemental speeaker ,  just don t get all excited for bt . 
for storage ,  i simply keep it inside the microwave at all times . 
the unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office . 
the product arrived on time and was in the condition i expected . 
i had a good result with some craft num_extend
i will do my christmas batches in august or september . 
i wanted something to listen to music and answer calls while being wireless . 
our very small toddler potty trained at num_num months and only num_extend tall . 
i am quite satisfied with it and the tea it makes . 
you can cut a slice as big or small as you like . 
it also never burns a single kernel ,  and leaves relatively few unpopped . 
this keeper shows off my beautiful bundts for all the world to see . 
the only thing i wish is that they were a little bit louder . 
i loved this case as soon as i opened the package . 
extension cords aren t the end of the world . 
i remove when they just start turning brown at the edges . 
my friend really wanted to find bigger bowls to use for salads . 
an extra step that s very well worth the time . 
heavy duty ,  well built ,  stamped rather than printed on sizes . 
just purchased the one for the disposal side with hole in center . 
it automatically connects to my smartphone when i turn the headset on . 
this is now my go to small appliance . 
it comes with washable filter which is very economical . 
hopefully this will be the last can opener that i ll ever need . 
love it !  makes great coffee and is very easy to use . 
these sleeves have two sections and are clear . 
we have been using them for about a month . 
however ,  i drain the battery by about num_extend every day . 
always pleased ,  and in love with lodge cast iron products . 
i am the owner of a pressure cooker group on yahoo called pressurecookerrecipes . 
some juicers do not have a pour spout which makes the process messy . 
currently in use in bedroom closet for storage . 
no problems with applying too much pressure ,  which makes it stick . 
so i needed something that was bluetooth and that is comfortable to use . 
a little bit at a time works fine . 
they are not like the thin ,  cheap ones . 
i just got an evo num_extend from sprint . 
i decided to try the motorola num_extend mainly because of my phone . 
they have a smooth top edge so they re easy to clean . 
wouldn t go back to microwavable popcorn unless i had to . 
its comes with num_num shelves ,  but can hold even more . 
i recently got the trudeau press and love it . 
i wanted to organize my dishes better and this was the solution . 
i highly recommend these if you re looking for longer tongs . 
fits snuggly in the cd player slot without damaging the player . 
lightweight ,  takes up less room in cabinet and in dishwasher . 
these are great ! they make water taste better if that is possible . 
there are no instructions packed with the mug for microwaving with the lid . 
espresso pros and newbs should all have a forthing pitcher . 
the crock seems heavy enough to bake in . 
num_extend camera ,  num_extend car holder for that price . 
i used a long metal spatula and another person for help . 
some reviewers say the lid is too thin . 
but i mean it s not that big of a deal for me . 
this is a very well made ,  beautifully designed kitchen tool . 
that being said ,  it s perfect for quick on the go . 
appart from that it s probably the best machine out there . 
it is very easy to install and remove if necessary . 
what more could i ask ?  i surely received my money s worth . 
nothing has melted off of it and the whistle works just fine . 
i hope they do not stop making them . 
the rubberized handle has a very professional feel . 
it cut through frozen ice cream and worked well . 
i highly recommend this brand and model of hand can opener . 
for someone that likes their tea extra strong it is fantastic . 
necessary maintenance tool for your shun kitchen knives . 
so you will have to experiment with timing your waffles too . 
this thing hasn t failed me in about num_num drops . 
love these !  work great and have held up well . 
i dunno ,  maybe this is the best way to go . 
in fact ,  i wouldn t doubt if god uses one of these . 
another great feature is the  lip  all the way around the circumference . 
it has enough juice to get you through a busy day . 
press the  program  button again to go back to time of day . 
i use these all the time as well as the larger size . 
i sent cuisinart an email ,  hoping they could help out . 
built really well and does exactly what it is supposed to . 
this thing can t be beat for the money . 
put your prepared bird on the bed of potatoes . 
i am wholeheartedly thrilled that i made it and cannot recommend highly enough . 
you need it ,  it works ,  it s easy to use . 
the corn cobs are perfectly steamed and taste delicious buttered . 
dropped on the concrete or down the stairs . 
the price is good and the ice cream is wonderful . 
it has good weight and i still cannot believe it s not glass . 
i highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price !  . 
the fit and finish are excellent ,  and this has a glossy appearance . 
i have had a few other fans and most have not lasted . 
if it was just a little longer it would be nice . 
so far ,  each charge has lasted at least num_num weeks . 
perfect for a host of small quantity items to be microwaved . 
my coffee tastes fabulous and stays nice and hot . 
this was a great buy for the price . 
straight line  but not fantastic at autocross racing  i . e . 
i have had very ,  very bad luck with coffee makers of late . 
we ve had roomba for about a month ,  now . 
i would have never thought how useful this charger would be . 
i bought this to use with my iphone while plugged into my computer . 
it does exactly what it says it would do with no problems . 
no issues with it as i know of . 
can be used as a serving tray also . 
just received in the mail and have used it several times all already . 
works like a charm and could not be happier . 
i used these with fondant to make my son s birthday cake . 
they are easy to clean and very durable under normal use . 
and speaking of response ,  the physical keyboard is a great feature . 
the good one is the cleaning cloth atttached cleaned excellent . 
what a difference a better coffee pot makes . 
this device does exactly what it advertises ,  at an extremely reasonable price . 
he called me on it the other day and it worked ok . 
the only charger you will ever need for a micro usb device . 
well worth the extra couple bucks to get stainless instead of plastic . 
i bought two more sets after i got the first one . 
phone looks like new months later after normal use . 
they re inexpensive but sturdy ,  and they were easy to put together . 
the cheaper item lasted a week and had to be returned . 
they are small but still do a great job of keeping things closed . 
it appears to be well made and holds the evo num_extend just fine . 
this case was perfect and arrived on time . 
i bought this for the office ,  and it works great . 
i received the kitchenaid mixer cover as a gift from my wish list . 
if you re looking for some serious protection ,  i d look elsewhere . 
and ,  as other reviewers have said ,  it leaks . 
this particular set is one of the most elegant in appearance and construction . 
fits ,  runs well ,  and therefore does the job . 
overall ,  these glass storage containers are very good . 
after years of use it finally died on me . 
i didn t want wood near my gas stove . 
this gel skin is exactly what i needed . 
there is no comparison to the bottled juices from the stores . 
thanks so much you guys for inventing this one . 
if there is grit in the bottom ,  wash lettuce again . 
it will hold knives and all things metal; scissors ,  spatulas ,  etc . 
it is difficult not to smile when using this brush . 
my phone fits perfectly even with the case still on . 
cleanup is no worse or better than any other garlic press ,  folks . 
not sure if it s pottery ,  ceramic or stoneware . 
make sure this is ok for your application . 
this pan is on its way to being my first choice for cooking . 
it s a nice addition to my kitchen arsenal . 
these are the only measuring spoons i want to use now . 
they are pricey but they last a long time . 
the ears come out easily ,  free of silk and perfectly steamed . 
it is heavy and does not distort from heat . 
i am a psychologist ,   there are real ethical issues here  . 
i do not like the feel of the phone . 
this is the perfect size for our oven . 
have had mine for about num_num years and am buying new ones finally . 
the phone has fallen and it bounces right back !  !  . 
no espresso machine steam wand at any price can beat this baby . 
it is black modern look and curved edges blend with any car interior . 
haven t had any problems with it at all . 
num_num bright blue leds indicate charging and when the unit is fully charged . 
purchased as a gift so i haven t used the product . 
i would not hesitate to use this company s batteries again . 
chemex ,  or pour over ,  makes a smooth and clean cup . 
i think it is just the wood s finish . 
it s all been relegated to the clearance corner . 
i like the grip   i don t use this pan in the oven  . 
this mount fits my phone perfectly using the longer set of prongs . 
thats why i m creating this review because its so good . 
when applied correctly you cant tell its there no bubbles . 
the rye and french loaves were amazing with fondue . 
the metal loses it s sheen ,  but still looks decent . 
i have been looking at counter top mixer . 
the earbuds themselves tend to protrude conspicuously out of my ears . 
the lids fit snugly and are a nice bonus . 
the rubber handles make it easy to grip even with wet hands . 
as soon as i go out of range ,  the headset says so . 
they work very well on several different model machines . 
i pulled mine out a little too quickly once and it came apart . 
i have several attachments for it that i use frequently . 
it works fast save time and easy clean up . 
the tiny little side plates are a joke . 
it doesn t cut it straight and really annoying to use . 
i prefer it to the drip type coffee makers . 
they are lovely and nice so we re keeping them anyways . 
they both perform the same in regards to insulating the beverage . 
i hadn t liked the last one ,  with the square loaves . 
the next time i peeled the potatoes and found it easier . 
this model is a pleasant surprise for several reasons . 
it s strong and becomes unnoticeable after a the first day of use . 
they are dishwasher safe and look so nice in the minimalistic style . 
just the right size for my double shot or single shot cups . 
i d used electric percolators before that or cheapo stove top units . 
the metal release did start sticking a bit after a few scoops though . 
this carafe is for num_num people who are not big coffee drinkers . 
it doesnt beep unless you set it on raisin bread . 
this wallet is everything i have been looking for . 
i use this for veggies ,  fruit ,  certain food appliances . 
wonderful quality ,  heavy and strong and easily cleaned . 
it actually does well with reducing road noise ,  which is nice . 
this one may be ,  since it is a newer model . 
as i said ,  the only problem i have is with the comfort . 
i use this at work and at home for my chai lattes . 
only problem is that it took a very long time to arrive . 
which is usually very risky  shipping and returns  . 
i put it on my phone and used it for num_num hours . 
i researched on amazon ,  and this one seemed to fit the need . 
rats ,  i should have got one for myself . 
pairs with my iphone , ipad and macbook with ease . 
the one downside is that all that steel can be kind of heavy . 
two and a half minutes and perfectly steamed veggies . 
i have purchased others that have died quickly ,  not this one . 
i have actually gotten compliments on how good the water tastes . 
i am completely satisfied with my purchase of these hangers . 
it will hold up well for a long time . 
i broke mine right away because i did it wrong . 
they are also so easy to put on your phone . 
it charges quickly and holds a charge very well . 
it works fast and can dry vegetables in a few seconds . 
overall a great speaker and i would purchase again . 
i like the rubber on the handle; keeps my hand from slipping . 
i had read the reviews prior to making my decision to buy brita . 
mine come out of the dishwasher looking great . 
great power and heats up the room quick . 
its a four out of five on comfort and appearance . 
this was a great buy ,  especially to have lasted so long . 
i ordered this because several others haven t worked so well for me . 
it slides in and out without a problem . 
even the white plastic outer part is easy to clean . 
once the water has boiled ,  the pot functions well . 
i would recommend that the company market this for jewelry as well . 
the tools are pretty big and easy to use  have soft grip handles  . 
it was really great and i love it . 
num_extend add extra oil to your cornbread recipe . 
they never shrink in the dishwasher and last for years and years . 
sometime you just have to get back to the basics . 
bought for num_extend and it fits the phone great and offers great protections . 
bought the item to minimize normal scratching of new stainless steel sink . 
my friends see me using my stylus and ask where i bought it . 
add tea bags  don t need the filter if using tea bags  . 
i love the handle and the channel where the coffee pours . 
i would recommend this product to my friends and family . 
i had this one for a couple of years . 
sound quality was better than expected and the fit was quite comfortable . 
i ordered two different otterbox cases over a year ago . 
i like this peeler better than anything i have to date . 
i bought this for a white iphone num_extend
if the water beads like mercury ,  you re good to go . 
the actual running of the machine you cannot hear at all . 
as with any knife you must care for it properly to preserve it . 
the case sustained some minor scrapes ,  but no other damage . 
the food processor has plenty of power for those smaller jobs . 
however ,  you do have to use some common sense . 
my phone did not stop working since then . 
my other num_num wisks are nice and rusty now .  .  . literally . 
aside from being noisy ,  i have no complaints . 
it makes the salads much more pleasant to eat . 
it heats up to num_num liter of water . 
worth the few extra dollars compared to less expensive ones . 
buy directly from amazon or a retailer to avoid this . 
it depends on what kind of stand mixer you have . 
this piece fit right in and looks great on the counter . 
samsung has pulled a magic trick with this one . 
switching in between carpet and hardwood floors is super easy . 
they made what could have been a very stressful event ,  hassle free . 
the packaging and the shipping seemed more expensive than the actual product . 
fits in pocket or attached to iphone or ipod . 
they had the right name but the wrong address on the package . 
feel like you re dining out with these lovey warmers . 
makes a great fondue ,  they use it often . 
i now have two of these contemporary pieces . 
called the company and they sent a replacement the same day . 
the size differential between the three are perfect . 
i checked several websites for air cleaner reviews . 
extra length is a must these days . good seller to . 
i use it for the droid charge and works perfect . 
this kit removes actual metal from your knife every time you use it . 
the amount of potectors you receive outweigh the averageness of the product . 
i think this one will last a lifetime . 
must have about num_num pairs of scissors for various other purposes . 
it resembles damascus steel  an art that has been lost . 
thinking about getting a second one !  highly recommend it !  . 
this little gadget is well worth the money . 
they are perfect for a cat s canned food . 
there are just too many buttons to accidentally hit and fumble with . 
we have replaced num_num cheap machines and now have the zojirushi . 
the little spinner inside the scoop releases the dough unlike using a spoon . 
didn t add too much bulk and offered great protection . 
i couldn t rate recommend it higher ,  especially for the price !  . 
has no front or back but offers protection around the sides . 
this is the best chopper i ve ever purchased !  . 
i am able to use a full usb device on my phone . 
perhaps i do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging . 
i didn t mind the rubber band until it breaks from overuse . 
i had their original model and now they ve improved it . 
one of the most important attributes for a headset is comfort . 
i will likely never use another brand of bundt pan . 
that being said ,  it works great for me . 
the size of the unit  for me  is ideal . 
it s excellent for cooking eggs and really anythign else . 
i decided just to remove it and get rid of it . 
you can fit in a fresh sauce at the same time . 
this case for my verizon iphone num_num is no exception . 
i ve used some other slicers that were okay . 
he will not break this squeezer ! it is beautifully made . 
i use mine for onions primarily because my eyes can t take them . 
i just retract and keep in my center console in my car . 
the quality of the sauce pan is great . 
seems like this cord is hit or miss for quality . 
i think faster than using a num_extend usb charger in my car . 
i m going to make this short and sweet . 
i also have the cupcake tin which has been great !  . 
they are light enough and made of wood . 
i used them for dipping cake balls ,  buckeyes and chocolate covered candies . 
i ve had a few different styles of toddler travel beds . 
when my freshly roasted kenya aa gets in there it s heaven . 
does the job just as well if not better . 
it is very embarrassing the first time you use this dyson . 
these knives are sharp just right and the serration does the rest . 
i have no idea they d work so well . 
seems like you have gone to a lot of trouble . 
i wiped it off and cleaned the camera eye and it was fine . 
i used this to convert a kenmore chest freezer to a kegerator . 
save the cover that comes with the product for storage reasons . 
but a good dust cover to completely cover your clothes . 
i have no complaints as of yet . i will update as necessary . 
i love all things fiesta brand so i m a bit partial . 
its a must have ,  so inexpensive and works perfect . 
i vacuum it num_extend per week when i have the big vac out . 
it keeps my french bread from becoming hard . 
fits in the ear with or without an earpiece . 
also ,  my other headsets are jabra and plantronics . 
he loves it ,  it looks great in his condo . 
can not live with out this if you do any canning . 
i love how it has a flashlight and a laser built in . 
i think every cook needs this stand mixer . 
i got this along with the pepper mill . 
it will not grind and clogs the grinder . 
this canner is designed to fit num_num quart jars perfectly . 
after buying this item a few months ago ,  it quickly became indispensable . 
plus they work great for phone calls too . 
this gets a lot of use in the kitchen . 
a little bulky ,  but it s not too far from an otterbox . 
my daughter in law saw mine and loved it . 
it rolls very easily and is nice and roomy . 
he needed something with small enough strain ,  so i found this . 
today i used it again and got perfect results . 
it is easy to install and it got the vacumn working again . 
it actually looked like i just shampooed it . 
neighbors lawn equipment and barking dogs drive me nuts . 
product works well and volume is better than a bluetooth . 
it works great ,  even with my otterbox commutter . 
i don t think i ll use my larger food processor again !  . 
price was good and it was delivered on time . 
wish they would have included a ss utensil container vs . 
over all ,  not a deal breaker for me . 
it it doesn t work at all try pairing it again . 
i no longer use my coffee cups i just use this mug . 
i make a point of following the directions without improvising . 
but this one is for having music fun !  . 
this is very good with the noise canceling and feel very comfortable . 
and it can be tricky to take the cover off . 
i never had a problem with the thunderbolt in my office or restaurants . 
i highly recommend it for someone who s looking for something like this . 
it s as if my old popper of the num_extend suddenly returned . 
if i hadn t lost it i could give a better comparison . 
the snap over clips hold the two sections together solidly . 
i m not like the professional barristers that are reviewing on here . 
it came two days before the delivery date ,  which is always cool . 
this way ,  i really have a great extension hose . 
get some d batteries and you are all set . 
we re only a family of three so it meets our needs wonderfully . 
these are really great cutters in so many sizes . 
replaced my lost plantronics unit ,  overall very happy . 
this num_extend inch victorinox knife makes a great size utility knife . 
it brews so quickly ,  that isn t really a big problem . 
this utensil rack has amazingly strong magnets and works just as it should . 
i got this to go with my red cable . 
they were cheap compared to some other sources of waterproofing . 
not so anymore with the supreme . sound quality is also excellent . 
my phone drops the case protects it  !  . 
the battery life is also far less than stellar . 
i use this at work for myself and a few friends . 
soft and nice as i was expecting it . 
i think this a rather nifty piece of gear . 
he synced it to his iphone in like ,  num_num seconds . 
the packaging is good and it arrived in package complete . 
great cable for a great price and really good quality . 
the iphone num_num was the best comparison as far as overall aesthetics . 
this makes it more attractive and easier to clean . 
i went with this one ,  it s smallish ,  but powerful . 
i bought one for the nexus and another for an evo . 
i really like it and the lid is simple to work . 
this is a great product !  great films and a cleaning cloth too . 
the heavy spritz dough loaded easily and pulling the trigger was also easy . 
the end fits over container that slices enter . 
as the name suggest ,  the defender is in actual term a defender . 
if you want a fancy gadget ,  you will be sorely disappointed . 
the tip is squishy and a little wider than a pencil . 
the sizes are good and close to comparison in photo . 
i was able to fairly easily attach this to the windshield . 
make my table look festive and the peppermill works great !  . 
excellent product and great service from the company !  . 
another side pocket would have made it perfect . 
the hoover windtunnel vacuum that i bought came with a ridiculously short hose . 
i would not want to do much more with it . 
we d buy another one ,  but they seem to last forever . 
it is so much better than the cloth bags . 
what can i say ?  it does what it s supposed to do . 
i use it as spare set for my phone . 
the camera is fantastic as is the video recorder . 
but keep in mind the fact that it only supports voice and num_extend
this works much better for spices that are crushed leaves . 
grilled cheese sandwiches come out perfect every time ,  as do pancakes . 
by far the best quality and comfort fit for the money . 
what people will do when they are desperate . 
the mini muffins comes out so perfect and pretty . 
i have only used them once but they worked as i expected . 
i wish i d gotten this a long time ago !  . 
the material is real durable and so far i am impressed . 
i have used another model and the container seemed to melt . 
was originally purchased for dura xt but can also be used with convoy num_extend
handy for storing all those extra plastic grocery bags . 
love it !  use it everyday with medium sized plate . 
we especially like hard boiled eggs and this is perfect fast and easy . 
i pour oil into the bottom and smear it around some . 
my husband hasnt taken it off since he got it . 
this was a gift for our daughter ,  purchased from her wish list . 
it was inexpensive and simple in appearance ,  which i like . 
it s not a huge inconvenience but it is slightly annoying . 
we use a heat pump which looses effectiveness past the ground level . 
it s very much like the high quality ones used at expensive restaurants . 
num_extend made about num_num dzn cookies and num_num batches of brownies . 
makes it easy to find just the scarf i m looking for  :   . 
if you order one of these ,  read the reviews . 
i thought the hype from consumer s reports was just that . 
consider it a basic piece of dutch oven equipment . 
the set came with steak knives that had the plastic handles . 
learn how to use one and you will never live without one . 
i wish it did cause i listen to the radio a lot . 
all of the parts are easy to use and remove . 
i am happy with the performance i get . 
i had a very difficult time finding a grid that would fit right . 
now the phone is easy to grip and not that fragile any more . 
this is my second kitchenaid immersion hand blender . 
this is by far the best blender we have owned . 
this will sure help to keep it clean . 
very convenient storage case for a roll of foodsaver bag material . 
i really like the way they make the cables . 
it makes a big difference with the taste of the food . 
haven t used it yet but i am sure it will be fine . 
this way i can prepare yogurt with organic milk . 
read the manual first and everything will fall into place . 
i ve had cases beforewhere the corners are always sharp at num_num degrees . 
it does what it s supposed to do and does it well . 
as most ocd people ,  i tire myself trying to find solutions . 
it makes a great holiday gift for anyone male or female . 
the num_num inch appears to be a great deal too . 
i ll be using mine now that i know how well it works . 
they are flimsy so they wont last a long time . 
doesn t scratch my phone like others havefits like a glovevery soft . 
i have used them for wine and olive oil . 
good price for a pretty big cutting board . 
if you are going to do this repair ,  have your own tools . 
it is what i ordered and it works just fine . 
and amazon is amazing with their speedy shipment and excellent return policy . 
the bottom shelf is for my spices and related items . 
the hinges lock tightly ,  and it does come with a rubber gasket . 
you ll love this and it is well worth the money . 
i love these bowls and i would definitely purchase them again . 
i didn t know they would be so noisy . 
but for $ i can t complain too much . 
and now loves the taste of the rice cooked properly . 
use with non chlorinated water for best results . 
i have had many ,  this one is the best . 
this is as good as the expensive ones . 
the local repair people were more than happy with its fit and finish . 
for such a small mic i think it worked very well . 
item is just as it appears looks like a small touch screen phone . 
then pour a cup of water in the glass . 
i think this will last many ,  many years . 
the only problem i had was with the volume . 
i use this pen for num_num hours a day as a physician . 
the faucet unit takes so much less space than the pur one . 
making royal icing is a piece of cake as well . 
i did what i could to work them out . 
it s pretty small ,  make sure the size is right for you . 
it doesn t leak and is just the right size . 
i user do have a crappy num_extend phone . 
when empty ,  they all nest nicely in my cupboard . 
i had it once before and was very happy to find it again . 
it s comfortable to hold and easy to flip pancakes . 
i m surprised how well the suction cups seal the overflow !  . 
i could only get it to work successfully for fruit smoothies . 
i hope they will be a big hit for the brunch !  . 
i ve converted at least num_num of my friends to the moka pot . 
i love that this wallet also has rfid protection . 
i agree with all the reviews that this product is excellent . 
my wife uses this to bring hot water to work . 
i like it and it isn t too tall . 
i used a bread machine to make my pizza dough . 
still just as long as my white apple one . 
they are among the top performers in the travel mug category . 
its wide top makes it almost impossible to spill . 
this was the first spare battery i bought for my htc inspire num_extend
since i originally reviewed this product ,  the price has actually gone . 
i suspect the plastic will get brittle in time . 
the prices of these replacement earbuds on jawbone website cost more . 
removing the tank requires the disassembly of a few parts . 
love that the battery life shows up on my iphone screen . 
otherwise ,  when it comes to vegetables ,  use the usual water system . 
although the sound is very good it could be better . 
i use it at least once a week . 
the best cast iron cookware on the market . 
even on the pyrex homepage it s way cheaper . 
i will be saving a lot of money making my own coffee beverages . 
they re what i would consider  normal sized  spoons and forks . 
because as you know it gets hot when it charges in the car . 
headphones too . second ,  there s no touch pad or screen protection . 
start making the ice cream during the coolest part of the day . 
it s a little shorter than i anticipated but does the job . 
i have used the regular sized pillow for many years and love it . 
if it says  presto  i am an eager buyer . 
had to replace a cover the chipped ,  of all things . 
because many people find the original review helpful ,  it is reposted here . 
these measuring cups are easy to use and easy to clean . 
as for quality ,  it earns every one of five stars . 
heats up well . i am quite happy with it !  . 
it just looks great ,  as most oxo prodcuts do . 
this is exactly what i was looking for and arrived on time . 
i love these ,  they stick perfectly in the middle . 
i guess we don t make anything in the u . s . 
wish they had the same design bottle in a bigger size . 
this case works well and looks good on the iphone num_extend
check out my review of it here on amazon as well !  . 
the blades wash up great in the dishwasher . 
it has a good weight to it and the lids fits on nicely . 
i only had the regular yeast i bought in bulk at costco . 
i ve always liked blueant products and you will too . 
it doesn t take up much room in the fridge either . 
within the next day ,  the screen was almost crystal clear . 
he wears them at work and when he works out . 
no ,  they aren t bose ,  but theya re really solid performers . 
other than that i am quite pleased with this phone . 
still ,  it is easy to carry in a shirt or pants num_extend
i would recommend this basic set to others . 
i am impressed !  and it smells so good . 
this unit beats using my electric stove and is much faster . 
i had no clean up to do at all . 
this large lid rests very nicely in this and is stable . 
if you have shedding pets this is the only vacuum to consider . 
it s perfect and exactly what it says it is . 
i got this to compare with other one that came with can opener . 
the battery life on that is a joke and they should be ashamed . 
i m glad that i got it here on amazon . 
i use this on potatoes and white mushrooms . 
dry it after rinsing and you will avoid white deposits . 
they do not have coatings to come off and get in your food . 
i have to say i m very impressed with this case . 
it s excellent quality ,  but much larger than i expected . 
you can easily attach a string to the end of it as well . 
protects phone very well from num_num ft fall into concrete . 
interestingly ,  the charger i received looks slightly different than what s pictured . 
i just bought this cutter to save myself the trip to the store . 
i love oxo tongs ,  it s as simple as that . 
i don t want to leave an ear infection to chance . 
they give you num_num other gels if the default doesn t fit . 
you don t need a scouring pad or steel wool pad to clean . 
plenty of capacity for our family of five . 
do not know how i got along with out them before . 
the sound quality is the best i ve seen so far . 
the product is simply perfect and made with great pride . 
it will puree your lentil stews ,  makes great guacamole . 
i would pay much more for this product . 
what s best opener right ?  this worked good too . 
i love that it works on wood and carpet . 
it s serves is purpose as nice jewels for my iphone num_num phone . 
this product arrived on time and was well packaged . 
unfortunately ,  they do not fit the chicago mettalic half sheet pans . 
tools came nicely packaged in a cylinder with pictures of the tools inside . 
we wouldn t have any mobile or num_extend service without our booster . 
waited for it to dry and then placed the plastic puck . 
wish i had storage room for the bigger one . 
it is small but very usable and powerful . 
for the price it is probably the best pot you will get . 
these have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties . 
this one is in that category ,  i m certain . 
over all it is a good screen proctor . 
however it does suffer from connectivity issues ,  always has ,  always will . 
i can really tell a difference with the oreck !  . 
it is light ,  maneuverable ,  and simple to use . 
a num_num rating as connectors seem a bit flimsy but work . 
i bought this mixer for one purpose :  to bake bread . 
a little tight in my incredible num_extend but they fit . 
this kettle does a perfect job of brewing the tea . 
i bought it with a knife of zwilling j . 
they really aren t made to last for ever . 
i am a little upset that this machine is currently unavailable . 
num_extend on top of the symbian operating system version num_extend
this is is probably the best cell phone holster that i have purchased . 
these rings look great and glide great on the rod . 
after num_num months of use ,  i m perfectly happy with it . 
it has met or exceeded most of my expectations for such a device . 
it s almost a shame to call it a chef s knife . 
your microwave may require more or less time . 
it charged my num_extend num_num times from % to %
the lid does rattle a bit ,  but that s fine . 
i think it maybe a defect in the case . 
i m posting num_num pictures ,  of various stages of making them . 
i bought this product because of its discounted coupon . 
i can store chopped onions next to tiramisu with no problem . 
i might add that i would not consider anything other than stainless steel . 
a towel takes care of it but it s still a concern . 
without the nutmeg ,  it they can taste more like cupcakes . 
it is a fast safe easy way to cook bacon fast . 
it arrived here in good shape and it bakes really well . 
when you do it correctly it is secure ,  but not tight . 
i firmly believe that glass blends better and cleans up better . 
works great ,  holds a lot of pasta and folds up well . 
i will be replacing it with another voyager pro . 
you couldn t ask for more and i use it almost every day . 
the pan has been used many times since christmas . 
i would recommend and i would purchase again if needed another one . 
that in itself aids the appreciation of any whiskey . 
coffee steam driven espresso maker died after about six months use . 
it works great though ,  once it heats up . 
nice that it s always charging ,  no cables needed . 
the knives are sharp and the extras are nice a great starter set . 
i like the design and easy cleanup that the scoop offers . 
this new machine makes perfect pizzelles that never stick . 
its an entry level price for a really good quality knife . 
this skillet is too large to use on my indoor stove . 
you have to be gentle or it can crack the cup . 
it leaves hardly any unpopped kernals and doesn t make a mess . 
it adds almost no bulk to the phone . 
the quality is excellent and is comparable to those brands costing much more . 
they feel just right in terms of weight and look great . 
i do not like the others i received . 
rubbermaid ,  much like tupperware ,  is made to be durable . 
if you get overly enthusiastic with mixer ,  you ll open the lid . 
i am a professional chef and need to work fast and clean . 
they are the exact ones that came with the phone . thanks . 
i believe the outer material will zip off and can be washed . 
this is all you need and it will handle it all . 
nothing like a freshly ground cup of coffee each morning . 
great for small apartments ,  pet hair and litter !  . 
you can t rely on the heft of this knife in hard chopping . 
comes with the proper tools for mixing cake batters ,  etc . 
i had it for a few weeks now and it works great . 
whatever it is ,  it cooks ,  browns ,  and cleans like platinum . 
well ,  i own an htc evo num_extend and the response is great . 
it s about double the price but is well worth it . 
a must if you sync your ipod and leave it on the desk . 
good size ,  nice finish and good fit for the two parts . 
quite a bit of force is required to complete the cutting task . 
we returned that machine in a matter of days . 
rechargeable stick vacs ,  in my experience ,  are just too weak . 
its made like an expensive piece but with a good price . 
we have num_num coffee drinkers who rise and set at different times . 
its easy to pair and easy to operate . 
i think the four pack is the best pack you can get . 
fit is perfect and very easy to apply . 
i purchased this coffee maker around num_num yrs . 
browns bread well even though it is light colored its not too shiny . 
very handy case to keep you valuables or electronics safe from the elements . 
it was easy to use and worked quite fast . 
i read the reviews here before i bought the mixer . 
i have owned it for about num_num months and its still going strong . 
olive oil wins hands down; at least for me . 
recognized quickly with no need to add a code . 
i don t think calling it  french fry  is very appropriate . 
this specific one had a defective battery that died after a week . 
nothing beats a fresh pulled shot of espresso . 
they are sturdy and have a sharp edge to them . 
i felt embarrassed at customer sites asking for a charge during meetings . 
i surely will purchase again with this sellerthank you . 
the jawbone era also has that function but def . 
i only wish the skin and browned and crisped more . 
if you have to ,  you can eke out num_num pieces . 
makes great drip coffee and looks great too . 
now i need to buy these in every color . 
would recommend this especially for the num_extend i paid for it . 
these knives are very sharp and don t lose their edge easy . 
i don t think that charge is well documented . 
both operate equally well . the bodum operates pretty much like the others . 
this device is such a boon when packing liquids for lunch . 
i will continue to use these and purchase them here . 
it also has a nifty little blemish remover which is welcome bonus !  . 
the less time i have with knives ,  the better . 
i had another plastic measuring cup that unfortunately met its end . 
this product was a gift for my sister . 
it is exactly the same ,  so now i buy the big one . 
i am very comfortable with my phone in this case . 
wow !  who needs to leave home to shop . 
comes with a storage lid and that s a plus too . 
the first one received was defective right out of the box . 
the splash shield is awkward to me and i don t use it . 
i had no trouble using this i have a razr num_extend
this item is smaller and simpler than i thought . 
this is my favorite brand of daily use glasses . 
the otterbox looks good on your iphone and it protects it very well .

i really like the cuisinart products and this is no exception !  . 
i was thrilled to be able to make coffee again . 
i don t know how many factory resets i tried . 
it took less than num_num minutes to grind num_num lbs of venison . 
anything longer will be too long for this . 
from what i could tell ,  the itorch was % compatible with the num_extend
i just knew the screen would be broken ,  but it wasn t . 
keeps it bug free ,  i have many pieces ,  love them all . 
the milkshakes produced by this blade are fantastic . 
the feared relic of my mother s and grandmother s kitchens has returned . 
i wish somebody would make smaller ones and sell them individually . 
the case fits tight at first but since it is leather it stretches . 
i set the lid on and sealed the jar . 
they re solid everyday dishes that newlyweds won t have any issues with . 
and you can see the food through the glass . 
however ,  the blackberry charger goes into my computer bag while i travel . 
works really good when cooking bacon on nuwave griddle . 
i have the num_num piece set of this product  ,  its a gem . 
i live in an area where there is lots of red clay mud . 
if the aa batteries are partially discharged ,  it might not see them . 
it will hold all kinds of fresh or frozen pizzas . 
i went through amazon wireless and spoke to them before purchase . 
the quality of the expresso is very good . 
it s pretty but bright as hell on night driving . 
i will be purchasing this as a gift for family and friends !  . 
others may justifiably consider what i view as shortcomings as trivial concerns . 
this did do its job till i needed a new one get it . 
takes me back to a better place in time . 
the actual product is precisely what was advertised . 
they were easy to apply and no air bubbles . 
i m sure i will find other uses for the grinder . 
i think i have finally found a sharpening strategy that works . 
it appears to be targeted to voip applications like skype . 
the nokia num_num num_extend flip fit the bill . 
i still have them even after i dropped my phone a few times . 
my callers say my voice comes through clear as a bell . 
the first steam iron we ever had spit ,  popped and bubbled . 
i have used for icing two cakes so far and it works great .

i will not use a smartphone without one . 
great for beginning chefs ,  easy to use and works as advertised .

this is a pan for serious steak cookers . 
started using it monday and everyday since total num_num days since review  . 
the clock and timer are easy to program . 
lids fit ,  all of the pieces arrived ,  nothing was broken . 
wilton are the only cookie cutters i buy . 
all in all ,  it is a great buy !  . 
very simple design that is easy to clean . 
it s a samsung brand cable at a very low cost . 
the type of coffee will be to your own preference . 
otherwise ,  what can i say ?  they re stainless steel bowls . 
now you have hardened batter in a space you can not access . 
num_num stars for the little sprayer num_extend minus num_num for the workout  . 
i had this exact same model for years . 
they last for a long time and seem to do their job . 
i purchased four of these and gave three away . 
my brother and father have also since purchased these units . 
i like this style brushed stainless steel square look . 
it will look absolutely elegant on my antique tea cart . 
if that is a concern ,  consider something else . 
a professional quality knife at a bargain price . 
it seems easy to install it on the vent . 
it has a strong substantial handle ,  pliable blade and works very well . 
got my num_num year service and triple minutes for life of num_num minutes . 
do not waste your money on any other brand !  . 
dyson needs to hire a better technical num_extend
the rubber bulb is thick and strong ,  and will last for years . 
it is worth it to spend a little more ,  especially on amazon . 
it is fantastic ,  i am buying one more . 
this is nothing fancy ,  but it works wery well . 
the pizza is cut on the stone and the pieces are left there . 
this knife falls into the category of overkill for me . 
they are just as good as any other cheaper screen protectors out there . 
they work very good and clean up is awesome . 
they have a nice weight and durable feel to them . 
i got all of these for really cheap and it worked as expected . 
i grabbed this bowl ,  tossed in some ingredients and went to town . 
i use it for my entire basement and stairs . 
 i write as someone who did not take any of this advice . 
i bought this quite a long time ago . 
the material certainly filters the water and grinds well . 
used with other fat daddio pans to make num_num tier birthday cakes . 
they are perfect for single or double servings . 
this thing is a hoot !  it is my first deep fryer . 
it s solid ,  well made and it does perform well . 
it does work but takes a little care . 
an inexpensive set but nice for everyday use . 
be sure to follow their recommendations on the rice to water ratios . 
you can customize three home screens with apps or widgets . 
but its great !  ive gotten compliments ,  no problems with it . 
well made ,  stylish ,  good looking clips with magnets . 
it works great charging the num_extend using my ipad usb charging block . 
i love this tea kettle ,  but it is so hard to find . 
to my surprise ,  it lifted these old stains . 
as well as using it as a coaster for just microwaved pyrex bowl . 
otherwise it will be handy for us to transport our knives when traveling . 
it is also nice to have the choice of two sizes . 
very nice ,  the highest quality stainless steel you can own . 
yet ,  the case may be too bulky for some users . 
it arrived on time and there was no issues with the product . 
this is good for infrequent use and small batches . 
i ve purchased several of these and they ve worked perfectly . 
they ve been clunked into one another and no chips or breaks yet . 
so this works better than the plastic one i had . 
i have made a call  as a passenger  and received a call . 
it s still on it s original battery more than num_num years later . 
they still haven t broken down in two years . 
we use it to block a paned door without coverings . 
this is the best insulated cookie sheet that i ve ever used . 
will buy more of these to recap wines as well . 
note :  it now has skyrocketed to double it s original price . 
i bought this as a gift for my hubby . 
the price is right and it does the job . 
love the color ,  the way it fit and look on my phone . 
he says it is working like it should . 
my wife likes it because it still easily fits in her pocketbook . 
it might be because it is white while the others are not . 
it looks pretty sitting on my counter next to my cappuccino machine . 
i think it could use a refinement or two . 
my pot handle was untouchable because of the heat . 
shipped fast and has done the job well keeping my phone protected . 
even with hard candies that have to reach num_extend
i bought the refurbished one and it works well . 
pairing was the easiest i have found yet with any blue tooth product . 
i recommend buying an additional mixer bowl and not the smaller insert bowl . 
these phones are fast approaching the size of a small tablet . 
the rubber has cracked in the bend of the right ear . 
my wife said this was actually her favorite christmas present . 
like all of kitchen aid s products this pizza wheel is top notch . 
i coordinate my cases with my outfits as i need to . 
i bought this as an amazon warehouse deal . 
i removed the hook and it works like a charm !  . 
this is much better than i thought it d be . 
that isn t a true measure of the unit s brewing temp . 
very simple to take off and press on to another item . 
we use this to bake pizza and cookies . 
had this product for over num_num year now . 
i didn t expect this skillet to be so small . 
i love the classic white as it always looks nice on your table . 
the size is big ,  can not put in your regualr pocket . 
don t know if a case could be better designed for this phone . 
i just needed to get the procedure down . 
the motor on mine is as good as new . 
paired up with my hct evo num_extend just fine in a few seconds . 
this knife makes the job of cutting bread so much easier . 
if you need one ,  you could do worse . 
lots of cooking room ,  and easy to clean . 
i enjoy using this for prepping and am very pleased with my purchase . 
looks nice beside my wustoff knife block making my kitchen look sharp . 
for that purpose ,  i have silicone trays in two sizes . 
i get around this by wrapping my shirt around my finger . 
the adapter part fits snuggly in the port hole in my ipad . 
not exactly breaking the bank for a nice set of mixing bowls . 
also as with otterbox the ports are well covered . 
nicely built ,  included carpet points but not hardwood floor feet . 
i have since upgraded my phone ,  but absolutely love this cover . 
in love !  i needed an organizer for my dishes in my cabinet . 
i can recommend these ,  they really work as stated . 
you can easily work out with them and they will stay in . 
clean up is easy and quick ,  as is the machine . 
this holde or something like it is not an accessory but arequiremnt . 
the lady told me you could make peanut butter with it . 
i have the stainless steel uplift and love it . 
the sound quality is much better than earbuds of the same price . 
performs as you would expect in the kitchen . 
it keep s in place and my phone protected from sweat . 
just drill it and it is done ,  num_extend operation . 
it cleans up so easy ,  cooks everything so perfectly . 
you do have to have the frosting on rather thick though . 
it is fairly easy to put on the phone and to remove . 
however ,  it does seem to overstate what it delivers . 
wife wanted one and i think she s been happy with this one . 
this iron glides accross the fabric  with the unique plate material  . 
it has been a great addition to my iphone . 
i m amazed at the number or featuresin this small package . 
if not the first . this has happened several times . 
it fits fine in the cage ,  just like the original one . 
i have seen it often on a famous cooking show . 
the adjustment screws for the cutting thickness are brass . 
this item is much better than the one i got with my phone . 
this meat pounder is nicely balanced and works great . 
build quality is good though the phone is very light which is good . 
the knife fits my hand perfectly and is so easy to use . 
you ll be glad you did . it s a great deal !  . 
it fit just fine and washes and dries easily without shrinkage . 
the timer is as good as it was said to be . 
it s easily a five star gadget in my book . 
i have used this charger during and after school and it works . 
i am very happy with the bowls ,  my purchase ,  etc . 
the simplicity and reliable functionality of this device is what sets it apart . 
everything was quick and easy to set up no problem . 
definitely a must use tool in my knife arsenal . 
i use this on my desk at work and it works well . 
i use it for everything but it s especially good for cooling cookies . 
now i just have to stock up my bar !  . 
it is worth the money ,  and beautiful design . 
second most used pot in my kitchen arsenal . 
i can bake desserts and use it as a roaster too . 
i ve tried other protectors and this is one of the best . 
great buy for the price and on time delivery . 
my only complaint is that they are too small for my large hands . 
luckily for her i usually keep this fan in my bedroom . 
you can get a case of num_num for about $
i purchased this item to protect my new droid razr . 
i m not going to write much of a review on this . 
the only negative we have found is that it is large to store . 
the non stick coating is put on evenly and it s really slippery . 
i understand that the newer version conks out after num_num feet . 
this item turned out to be even more handy than expected . 
we bought it when our regular toaster went on the blink . 
with just num_extend on ,  the phone last about num_num day or so . 
i use it for cleavage of vegetables and meat . 
it s water resistant  ,  not huge ,  and not ugly . 
only down side is that one of the arms has already broken off . 
does extactly what you need it to do . 
this is a relatively affordable set as far as pressure cookers go . 
it makes slicing up roasts and other sides of meat easier . 
i just bought one of these for my folks for christmas . 
just turn it until it isn t shining at you . 
all of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly . 
the colors  got turquoise and purple  are vibrant and eye catching . 
it sprays evenly and doesn t take much to pump it . 
bought it as a birthday gift for the girlfriend . 
i love the texture .  .  . it feels like brushed steel . 
oxo offers a lifetime % satisfaction guarantee  on all of their merchandise . 
four styluses for quite a bit less then the average price of one . 
i dropped my num_extend dozens of times and it never suffered any damage . 
smaller and less cumbersome than the full bucket . 
i think it may not work for devices running wm num_extend
just put on the touchstone and you are done . 
i got this as a christmas present for my brother . 
does hard floors well . the free shippind was a great help . 
hope they will make a flatware set that is not oversized . 
this pan is the sturdiest jelly roll pan that i own . 
its well built and the steam jet is quite powerful . 
all her parts and pieces  almost anyway  ,  fit in here nicely . 
it s super cute and it protcts my phone enough . 
this is a great basic hanging pot rack . 
i ve been amazed at just how much i use it . 
it arrived on time and in new condition . 
easy clean with bartenders friend ,  also a magical product !  . 
you can make a bunch at once ,  and nothing escapes . 
for this price ?  give them a go !  you cannot go wrong . 
it also scrapes the sides of the bowl better than the num_num quart . 
the shelf looks nice and works for its intended purpose . 
kinda bulky but so worth having and it looked so good . 
i use a glass quart canning jar to incubate and store the yogurt . 
i don t think even a college kid could destroy these . 
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
must buy an extra set now before they run out . 
seems to stick that round red nose into every nook and cranny it num_extend
i was very pleased at the speed my orders were filled and delivered . 
this pan is perfect to hold a jelly roll cake . 
i got this to hold the long cord for my desktop headset . 
we don t drink scalding coffee so temp is perfect for us . 
so i was in a pretty deep routine . 
after more than five years it still works perfectly . 
again ,  i really wanted to love the omega . 
the first was to try and control the fur shed by the others . 
i definitely would always use it with the brush on . 
it worked perfectly to cook everything from peach cobbler to stew in !  . 
the bails really do wear faster than i expected . 
i needed these rings to cook them in . 
i like the thin profile compared to otterbox . 
and will update once that trial is done . 
the speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone . 
the price seemed like a lot of money for a screen protector . 
i bought the same after reading the reviews and the product delivered . 
perfect for keeping my coffee s flavor intact in the fridge . 
this screen protector is great and not too expensive either . 
this thing will grind up just about anything you can put into it . 
it has a secure plug and a normal length . 
camera is adequate for all of my needs and windows rocks !  fast . 
some comments stated the item appeared used but this one did not . 
no ,  u dont have to pay for most apps like iphones . 
this bluetooth isn t anything fancy ,  but it works . 
the strap seems sturdy and meets my needs . 
this motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone . 
however not all thick bottom works the same . 
num_num paper filters ,  and not just because we have num_num costco no . 
haven t found anything like this at a store here . 
if you don t have one and you can you are missing out . 
bought this because i have kids and thought they would enjoy the shapes . 
we bought this replacement battery for our original roomba model . 
my parents bought one years ago ,  and it s still going strong . 
this is a snap together clear plastic case . 
you won t be disappointed with this pan no matter what . 
once the stream player works ,  it s pretty good . 
first you soak the stone in water for about num_num minutes . 
i am sure that i will like it . 
i didn t immediately notice though but little things were different . 
the pan was solid and seems like it will last for years . 
it really does the job well in a stylish manner . 
in case you mess one up you have two left . 
fits phone snugly and does not feel bulky at all . 
i spent a bit more on the razr ,  but it was reasonable . 
ultimately ,  it all came down to blendtec vs vitamix . 
this set is not ,  but seemed just as sturdy . 
this processor has significantly made my life easier . 
surely enough the iphone num_num actually charged faster than a regular wall charger . 
i m now more conscious of my electricity usage . 
i have also experienced random bluetooth pairing issues in the past . 
i bought this set of attachments for my mother . 
construction is solid ,  not cheaply made at all . 
the case just flops around and doesn t stay put on the phone . 
no need for mental math and you only dirty one cup . 
therefore ,  it looks like i will save over $ per year . 
apple makes the most unbelievable products hands down . 
and takes up just a little storage space . 
i just put on my iphone screen protector . 
it is priced reasonably enough to replace it . 
bought this to take up little space in my car . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
i will definitely be buying more pyrex soon . 
i haven t owned a food processor in years . 
it s high enough quality to scoop even chilled dough . 
geat for my iphone especially at work where the battery gets drained easily . 
we don t have an electric fryer of any kind . 
i recently moved to germany with my husband because of his job . 
the mount is sturdy ,  has numeorus adjustment angles in its articulated arm . 
i dropped one ,  and instead of shattering is bounced . 
it works great and has never given me a problem . 
used this  magic  opener a few times and it s amazing . 
it s time to buy a new temp gauge sidekick . 
might be tough for someone with small hands to use at capacity . 
you know how dangerous to pull it out . 
pancakes still cook ,  but they are lighter in color . 
however not the best portability wise based on the weight . 
my mom has used these pyrex bowls for years and loves them . 
the color of this is not burgundy as it appears in the picture . 
this charge was like num_num or num_num bucks . 
i purchased this item based on the very positive reviews of other buyers . 
fits my son phone perfect he has no complaints and neither do i . 
it works really well and is easy to take apart and clean . 
i will definitely buy this product again when i need to replace these . 
this one however will slide if not on a rug . 
if you want a case for your storm . 
i guess is just something i have to get used to in time . 
it is weighted on the bottom so it avoids tipping over . 
if you don t ,  the eggs are difficult to remove . 
if that sentence describes you ,  you will love this coffee maker . 
it is quick ,  producing num_extend in about a minute . 
six straight and six angled hookes came with my potrack . 
it did a nice job with a minimum amount of work . 
so today i went out and bought an iphone num_extend
this pot is quite beautiful when it comes out of the box . 
i didn t find it to take any extraordinary pressure . 
i just needed another one to keep with me at work . 
now that is all that i have to say . 
it will charge your gear but be warned of the heat issues . 
i ve been wanting one of these for a long time . 
they are very strong and heavy and will last for a long time . 
it is almost indistinguishable from a wired headset . 
we tested them standing in front of a fan and air conditioner . 
the buttons work very nicely and i would buy another one . 
what more can i ask for its perfect . 
i should have bought one for the wedding gift too !  . 
strongly recommend to anyone looking for a travel mug . 
in time i will purchase the other sizes . 
arrived in a timely manner ,  battery performs just as expected . 
i purchased two of these for work ,  and they both work nicely . 
with these pans ,  each crepe would turn out perfectly crispy . 
a piece of electrical tape as fixed num_extend
the amazon price is one of the best . 
i love the size ,  and lodge products are always fantastic . 
much healthier than most bagged popcorn ,  and tastes great . 
this is the first garlic press i ve ever used or purchased . 
this  large  corn stick pan makes seven little num_num inch corn cakes . 
this is a replacement for one i ve had for num_num years . 
it fits in my car s cupholder quite well . 
bought these after testing a set that my dad bought . 
another pros to this cup is ,  cleaning is now super quick . 
we will have to try something else like laying it across the tub . 
bought several and keep one everywhere since so many things are microusb now . 
please note ,  this is for the key rack . 
finally i can open and shut my utensil drawer easily . 
this makes a great addition to the package . 
even pouring sugar makes a mess inside the container . 
never noticed a difference between them ,  they all work the same . 
it s just what i needed for my windows tablet . 
then i microwave on high until the food is cooked . 
now there is no question whether i am on the phone or not . 
i put my dish soap bottle and sponge and steel wool . 
this is our new standard in our office . 
i like the look better of the already blackened pan . 
this was the num_extend choice of america s test kitchen . 
have several true weight items and it was perfect with every one . 
these are advertised as being very high quality glass . 
great product cover fits well and does job for protecting my ipod . 
in comparison ,  the num_num has a less polished interface . 
not a tear shed because it is so sharpe . 
they are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening . 
the internet radio plays through bluetooth in my car . 
upon delivery ,  i was surprised how heavy the box was . 
i just toss them back in the cupboard to air dry . 
it also removes most pollen from the air . 
this filter works great in my air cleaner . 
doesnt seem as if it will break easy . 
cleaning the pan after use is also easier . 
how coarse ?  a little trial and error will tell you . 
it also seems to handle wind noise adequately . 
it is the exact same usb plug that comes with the htc evo . 
just trim the rubber all the way across just under the microphone indention . 
the bag full of charging adapters is nice . 
relift and restick as needed to remove num_extend
buy it on sale ,  you can t go wrong . 
the reviews were positive for me to take the plunge and purchase one . 
i woke up to coffee all over the kitchen . 
but you can store food in it as well . 
the texture makes it a more classy and expensive looking case . 
plus the little crocks are handy to use by themselves . 
mine looks brand new after years of abuse . 
this has far surpassed the other too imho . 
this vac charges quickly and has great suction . 
well worth the price ,  and is made of very durable material . 
finally ,  i can dispense adequate pepper when cooking and eating . 
so i purchased this one to replace it . 
i only rinse it out every few times . 
leaving the frother near the surface will produce a huge layer of foam . 
i wear it on my belt to work every day . 
so i am good with the case at current moment . 
it fit perfectly and was able to continue to use the phone . 
i was also concerned about the longevity of the paper disk insert . 
hopefully it ll be a nice addition to newer chargers . 
and the price is so much better than getting it direct from manufacturer . 
i recommend it highly for the blackberry bold num_extend
and it is heavy ,  almost too heavy for this senior citizen . 
with all those changes it goes down to about % or less . 
so far ,  so good . overalli am so happy with this purchase . 
people need to stop expecting so much from cheap products . 
this is the perfect size for two or three people . 
easy removal for easy cleaning of the phone and its a great protection . 
the cap is nice to keep the salt dry . 
i keep them everywhere i might want to charge a phone . 
it was exactly what i needed and fit perfect for my iphone . 
in the rental home ,  it could clean anything . 
i have used every weekend since we have gotten it . 
the razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring . 
these cables are nearly exactly like the oem ones from apple . 
they peel off the mini cupcakes without any problem . 
i don t understand the outrageous cost of the most expensive units . 
up until now ,  it has worked rather well for the price . 
i use it almost everyday and recommend it . 
this is a top rated slicer in a well known cooking magazine . 
several times per hour ,  not too often ,  but it is loud . 
too dry or wet and you have problems . 
i m really happy with the size and quality of this piece . 
not very creative ,  but i really like this case . 
i primarily use it for  on  and  off  . 
it is very easy to clean and takes up very little space . 
only num_num stars because it doesn t fit all wine bottles . 
i use it at least twice a week for lemonade . 
then ,  i dumped the  contaminated  water out and did the same thing . 
now when i mop i know i ve gotten the dirt up first . 
you can t go wrong with a kitchenaid mixer . 
this is a good size to fry num_num or num_num eggs . 
this phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera . 
this is the first one i ve ever had an issue with . 
i have never used a microplane grater before . 
it took some trial and error to get the timing right . 
this is way better than the other holders . 
i ve had smaller usb battery packs ,  like the motorola num_extend
the oxo stays sharp and just plain does the job !  . 
this is the perfect shaped bowl for making and eating popcorn out of . 
they re durable ,  wash easily ,  the whole corelle story . 
all of my dishes and plates fit perfectly underneath it . 
this is a fantastic set of essential kitchen tools . 
set it for the type of meat you re cooking and walk away . 
he says it s  good enough  for the price . 
unlike calphalon cookware ,  it can go in the dishwasher . 
as others have mentioned it does collapse easily . 
however i have had num_num cell phone since i had the htc . 
clean and dust the phone right before applying . 
volume changes on the headset does change the volume on the phone . 
frame rates are consistently smooth when swiping between home pages and opening apps . 
the dvp has deep blacks and fast response during gameplay and video playback . 
i like the light on the front so i know it s powered . 
for smaller jobs i have purchased a bamix immersion blender . 
it s funny ,  but i ve only used it once . 
this happened to me yesterday while teaching a lesson in church . 
i ve purchased my share of cheap ,  crappy cases . 
this product is so overpriced that the company should be embarrassed . 
i don t think it will fit the galaxy note ,  however . 
we have had no problems with any of the pieces . 
if you need to pack coffee this is what you need . 
it s easy to clean ,  cooks my food evenly . 
for as cheap as it was it s really fun . 
this is a great thermometer once you get the hang of operating it . 
linking was easy ,  and the sound quality is excellent . 
the mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery . 
you won t believe the difference in the taste of the wine . 
can match with all of my spring and summer outfits . 
if i get an important call ,  i tend to pull over . 
i would say you can trust the advertised function . 
it will continuously scan if you do and that is a power drain . 
if you re complaining about how its built ,  look who built it . 
i would happily recommend this one to anyone new to pressure cooking . 
these are even better than i thought they would be . 
i even have several things on two of the hooks . 
i find it s a great activity to do with kids . 
the motorola num_extend had the best overall performance . 
this attachment made making tomato sauce a snap . 
i received the cookie sheet today and couldn t wait to use it . 
the case is just the icing on the cake . 
place that atop the chute to catch wayward beans . 
it keeps it warm for hours ,  just like everyone says . 
a bit of patience and persistence will pay off . 
i just wipe off the excess grease and put it in the dishwasher . 
try grinding toasted almonds in the others and it will take months . 
for the most part it is a large external pocket with separate compartments . 
but the chrome top does not seem to be best quality metal . 
i also have a bunch of different sizes for leftovers . 
the latch is a little hookie but it seems to work for now . 
it is the correct size for my sink . 
this case really makes people think you re holding a cassette tape . 
these work great for cake pops !  i would buy these again . 
it paired up with the phone very easily . 
i highly recommend for every from cooks to chefs . 
it grinds the coffee and feeds it directly into the filter for brewing . 
if only i can find the seller again .  .  .  . lol . 
also looks great and is great for blade edges . 
not sure how they would hold up in the dishwasher . 
my three cost much less than one board . 
it s got a sheen to it that looks very classy . 
it is about half an inch wide and fits snugly in the cap . 
i m still happy with the color and will enjoy it . 
cleaning can be a pain since it s big and num_num big parts . 
good battery life ,  easy recharging ,  simple to use . 
plus ,  i am not strong enough to scoop with them . 
just the sight of one makes my feet weak . 
it releases the cakes and cupcakes without any problems whatsoever . 
i purchased this particular one based on a review in cooks  illustrated magazine . 
the replacement came within a week and i take this thing everywhere !  . 
i m very happy with this vacuum and would purchase it again . 
don t drop ya stuff ,  but if ya do otterbox it . 
it does exactly what it says it suppose to do . 
after soaking ,  even the worst messes clean off easily by hand . 
the grill smell goes around the house that makes me can t sleep . 
it does state on the packaging that it recommends hand washing . 
we have loved this toaster for num_num years now . 
but it would be nice to have a fitted silicone handle . 
keeps both hot for at least num_num hours and warm for num_extend
i recommend doubling the sugar as it only calls for num_num tablespoon . 
i man when a potato costs a $ these are extremely reasonable . 
it is still % usable and does not cause any problems . 
i recently received a galaxy num_extend that uses a microsim . 
so i purchased this  masher  and couldn t be happier . 
i with they would come out with a waterproof version . 
the chocolate melted down quickly and i had no problems with it sticking . 
i always saw these being used on cooking shows . 
it is solidly built and should last a long time . 
i really didn t think the carpets were that dirty . 
the the spatular is curved so it scraps bowls well . 
all in all ,  very happy with the purchase . 
it charges my smartphone  nexus num_extend at least twice  from % of battery  . 
you can t fine a better tea kettle for the price . 
if you need this product buy with confidence . 
this model is the best size and cost for the galaxy num_extend
perfect tool for the do it yourself cook ,  like i am . 
remarkable how much grease it elinates from your meatloaf . 
got a used i phone for free so gave it to our son . 
outside ,  the occasional static ,  but far less than my num_extend headset . 
these get the job done and are quite honestly expendable at this price . 
that s about seven dollars and fifty cents each tray . 
i use it daily and sometimes many times a day . 
te same holds true for my purchase of this unit too . 
very well made and they work very well . 
it doesn t mention it anywhere on the packaging or in the pamphlet . 
this machine has unbelievable suction and a huge bag . 
easy to install and does a great job of protecting the phone . 
i have never been happier with a decision . 
my man said they were the best muffins i ve ever made . 
does what it needs to do at an excellent price . 
i used the bluetooth for over a year . 
i already own two sets of these bowls and am buying more . 
s s s s s ss s s s s . 
it does stick a great deal if you don t season it occasionally . 
this is a genuine irobot aps battery for the roomba . 
thick silicone case ,  it s still a little flimsy . 
that is the only reason i give this num_num stars . 
i can see now why a burr grinder is better for coffee . 
wow !  these trays added a lot of room to my dehydrator . 
the cover seems superfluous but i don t mind it being there . 
if you bake breads often ,  this tool is indispensible . 
our first batch of ice cream didn t turn out so well . 
i like the wood base versus the old plastic base . 
am pleased with everything ,  and the price was good as well !  . 
this is just a spatula that has a bit of curve to it . 
i didn t know therewas so many different htc phones . 
these pans are heavy ,  high quality and will last a lifetime . 
it does a great job on my sewing projects . 
the heck with going to stores ,  calling around or asking . 
this mixer has made hundreds of recipes including many catered meals . 
it really is thin but i feel like it really protects my phone . 
on these headphones ,  it s a quick double tap . 
only thing she would change is the size . 
but other than that my hubby liked it !  !  . 
i would highly recommend this one to anyone who wants a perfect omelet . 
i didn t like reading the instructions ,  but did . 
it is loud but not as loud as i was expecting . 
we love it !  works well in our cast iron cookware . 
i drink plenty of coffee in the office ,  throughout the morning . 
wish i could buy every single thing oxo makes !  quality products . 
i would consider this the best bluetooth available at this time . 
recommended unless you want a really pretty looking one . 
you can really feel your phone is protected . 
i can live with that ,  as long as the suction is powerful . 
unfortunately things get broken and this was the perfect replacement . 
never seen any garlic press like this one . 
that was the straw that broke the camel s back . 
it is not a cheap made turner and works really well . 
it s a very nice case and it s very pretty . 
that didn t help me get the right item that i wanted . 
i am glad that i got it and would recommend highly . 
i am happy with this little cheap case . 
never use that spray on cooking oil in an aerosol can . 
i wasn t too thrilled about using ground meat with the gun though . 
all in all it works fine and is worth the price . 
awesome product ,  came right on time if not a few days early . 
the bottom is cooked more than the top . 
she has used it and it works as advertised . 
i give them to my friends all the time too . 
that is the proper grind for french press . 
next ,  i made alton brown s creamy mashed potatoes . 
i should have had one of these years ago . 
turning headset off then on again fixes this problem . 
i have yet to have any issues out of the sealer . 
it s far superior to the aluminum one i had . 
i just order another cover for my iphone num_num just great cover . 
i bought three of this series from this company and i love them . 
great item to have . fast service and reliable one .

the nissan stainless steel thermos keeps coffee scalding hot for hours . 
all good things about this item have already been said . 
we got two one in blue and green . 
num_extend i m still cooking up a storm with this set; going strong . 
only reason it isn t perfect is the back . 
we discussed my review in detail and my dissatisfaction of the product . 
i purchased these because they were highly recommended by cooks illustrated . 
i also needed something portable since i fly quite a bit . 
i believe its worth every penny i paid for it . 
i have been using this product for years . 
i ended up ordering num_num for me after !  . 
i currently have this case on my iphone and love it . 
i ve taken the num_extend to num_num countries and all seven continents . 
the phone slips in easily and stays in place . 
as far as packaging ,  mine were in english and chinese . 
mine used all num_num leds to indicate battery level . 
and no guilt over putting them in dishwasher . 
bumped my review up to num_num out of num_extend
it consistently hits right where i thought it would . 
it did a great job spinning the water out . 
i ve messed up every time i ve used them . 
i took it apart and found that the plastic gears had stripped . 
it s a great little unit and the price is very reasonable . 
all in all a great bargain i think !  . 
i almost sent this back when i saw how enormous it is . 
i purchased this to grind flax seed on my food . 
these a gorgeous ,  durable and everything you want in a champagne flute . 
reception is excellent with both her razr num_extend and my bb num_extend
we use it to keep out hatchet in tip top shape . 
color really looks good on the black phone . 
a great way to add a bit of air to your wine . 
i recommend this product for a quick cup of froth coffee . 
i installed two by myself and organized everything in under an hour . 
moreover ,  the entire set comes with a lifetime warranty . 
it also fits into the basket for compact storage . 
this particular style seems to hold up very well . 
the wife purchased this and just loves it . 
pairing the jabra num_extend with my android was smooth and easy . 
the side releases nicely from the cheese cake . 
the pot ,  which never rusted ,  goes in the bottom rack . 
the blades are really sharp ,  so be careful !  . 
years ago i bought a potato cutter at a garage sale . 
i mainly bought it to transfer sound from my phone to car speakers . 
all i have to do is go online and set up my account . 
i am so happy with this board !  it is gorgeous . 
so hand drying would be the way to go . 
i put my oatmeal in this every morning to bring to work . 
i received this item last week and immediately tried it . 
my wife likes the purple because it shows up inside her purse . 
it does the trick without my having to worry about burning the bottom . 
i have bought more and in different sizes for gifts . 
i still give it four stars !  good value !  !  . 
filtered water makes all the difference in taste and maintenance of your machine . 
overall ,  this case is a very handy addition to your iphone . 
they are every bit as good as the manufacturer claims . 
i ve been a victim of num_extend party accessories . 
tonight i made some fudge in it and it performed perfectly . 
for around $ this is a great little bumper . 
and it makes excellent popcorn and looks pretty cool as well . 
the only complaint is i wish it was bigger . 
finally ,  i don t have to worry about scratching my screen . 
first off ,  this is a well made unit . 
you can still use it to seal jars . 
it s inexpensive as well as simple to use and clean up . 
i have used and broken many can openers . 
she only charges and doesn t use data so i swapped them . 
there they are inconsequential because they can t get down to the bottom . 
play with it to see how it works on different foods . 
should have bought more than num_num when it was num_extend after num_num mir . 
i paid under $ so i would still buy em again . 
bought this for my wife to use with her lg phone . 
it really is something that could be easily fixed with better engineering . 
a friend saw my set of these and liked them . 
this is a fine case for the samsung captivate . 
i could get used to these real fast !  good value !  thanks . 
it is one of the best brackets i have owned . 
can t want to use it on waffles for the family . 
i like it very cool ,  even in the winter . 
my old head set was a good num_num to num_num years old . 
the case is hard so it does not crush easily . 
no problems at all with the screws ,  wood ,  parts ,  etc . 
can double as a syrup pitcher on pancake day . 
used ice cubes and did not put the top on the tumbler . 
because of that we looked specifically for a thermos beverage pumper dispenser . 
colors are very very beautiful despite the yellow . 
the glasses do everything they say they would do . 
speaker s  rattle if you turn the volume up beyond a certain point . 
that s my only complaint ,  otherwise very happy with the fit . 
i like the matte finish to knock off the glare . 
i have used many other springform pans and the all evenutally leak . 
my verdict ,  they were all okay i was pleased with the results . 
pros :  overall i am happy with these dishes . 
this set is made in germany using their ice hardened friodur method . 
it came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip . 
looks exactly like the battery that shipped with my wife s num_extend
this set of pans are very light weight . 
then ,  of course ,  you have on and off . 
this butter dish arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
it s a great shape ,  and so easy to put together .

i have this exact timer though mine says  pampered cheff  on it . 
my wife cannot complain that i buy junks from the internet .

i can t believe how simple it is to use . 
thank you anker and laptopmate !  !  keep up the great work !  . 
i actually got num_num and gave num_num to my mom . 
they have all served us well in the last num_num years of marriage . 
i use this on a daily basis in my honda fit . 
this brand is amazing and the prices could not be better . 
sometimes my bag needs a little more space . 
if you are doing the same this is a great little set . 
easy to clean and they nest for easy storage !  . 
great serving bowls and they are a good big size . 
i worry this one won t last twenty years like the old one . 
i take one point out due to this . 
we had to have another one right away . 
it s a really good mix of large and small containers . 
will surely  eventually  be getting more mason jars  and caps  . 
no other bottle opener can compare to this one . 
gets my hands dirty but they clean up . 
i have both this and the  clear  argyle case . 
they feel comfortable in the hand and clean easily with dish soap . 
the wick lasts for several months if you take care of it properly . 
just wish that it was sold in a complete package . 
the bottom of this pan is not quite flat . 
total thickness  before cooking  of sandwich is limited to about num_extend
they look cool and you pay for that in the price . 
i wish there was one that was more fingerprint resistant . 
heat is quite even over the entire surface . 
easy to use and easy to store in the kitchen for quick use . 
i also love the mirror effect to help me in times of fashion . 
and from a family that has had the same restaurant bauernhof for centuries . 
you ll appreciate it if you re making coffee to serve to guests . 
the water seems to taste just as good . 
it is even a little hard to get into the sink to wash . 
the only thing i would change is the length of the hook . 
i would recommend it to my family and friends . 
hope this one lasts as long as it has for other posters here . 
full tang ,  nice heft ,  and cuts through hard crusty bread effortlessly . 
i have read several negative reviews here which are not necessarily accurate . 
i also enjoy the loud beep that signals when it s done cooking . 
my account recognized it right away ,  and i was talking immediately . 
bought it and was hugely disappointed when i opened the box . 
keeps in the warmth and best of all is unbreakable . 
but it doesn t serve the purpose i need . 
so far it has more than fulfilled my expectations . 
i am very pleased with this unit and the quality is excellent . 
my kitchenaid mixer came with a metal version of the beater . 
note :  when the scale turns off  after a period of inactivity . 
i have not yet figured out what i am doing wrong . 
not much to go wrong with it though . 
the blue grip part of this item may stain . 
this starts the compressor and the internal condenser cooling fan . 
this is a replacement for my current toaster . 
and yes ,  it does work as a manual panic button . 
this screen protector works great and lasts a long time . 
i use it every day with the travel mug . 
the color fits in with my other dishes . 
it was under $ so i really can t complain . 
i don t even try to use it anymore . 
i love the knurled edges that make it easy to grip . 
excellent for straining citrus juice to keep the seeds out of your num_extend
it s nice that it comes with a sharpening tool too . 
these things need constant attention and care to remain unscathed !  . 
but i routinely use these batteries when the phone runs low . 
also great for batter ,  gets the lumps right out . 
amazon had the exact replacement num_num cup  black  . 
it does not stay on ,  falls right off . 
in a few more seconds the louder suction sound came back . 
it s simple ,  but gets the job done at under num_num bucks . 
this works well ,  and the pop corn is very fluffy . 
i searched the web and found an english manual to download . 
i think it will work good to sustain some drops .

and even if you do it s no biggie !  . 
i highly recommend this for anyone using a cordless home phone . 
for price and function ,  you can t go wrong . 
i like the weight and feel of the knife . 
since these are noise isolating this is not a problem . 
if i have one complaint ,  it is the filter . 
i don t have any complaints about the product . 
i d give num_num stars if they had described it accurately as  used  . 
works very nice whit the lid wand ,  no more burnt fingers .

the pan is very resilient and bounces back to its original shape . 
took me all of num_num minutes on a pleasant saturday afternoon . 
i expect the same quality out of this one .

after having gone through several cheaper brands  e . g . 
remove from heat and allow to cool slightly . 
i have two of the vacu vin wine bottle coolers and love them . 
this cover is so nice good quality and made well . 
as well as any ,  all of them are hard to apply .

too bad the lid costs more than the skillet . 
a year or so later ,  and we re enjoying our kettle .

it works flawlessly out of the box for my galaxy num_extend
one of the best things i like is it is fairly quiet . 
these fit just like all the other low cost screen protectors out there . 
works as well as much more expensive knives and stays sharp over time . 
after that bad batch ,  because i buy the num_num oz .

it runs smoothly and i m happy about my purchase .

in this two chef household ,  we ve used silicone sheets for years . 
this grasp tightly and can hold wider phones . 
in all aspects of cooking ,  common sense is always important . 
i thought this was a flaw until i visited their website . 
the num_extend one experienced a few practice runs . 
i recommend ,  but can t vouch for the matching accessories  food use . 
cases do not work with it as others have stated . 
i thing is very useful when you go to distant places .

a set of four for four bucks ,  that s a deal .

my city went to hands free only while in the car . 
i cannot authentically use this baking sheet with the recipes i must test . 
it was so easy and the attachment pieces are very durable . 
i think it is a stretch to call this a canner . 
maybe they ve fixed some problems since the early reviews were posted . 
it always cleans to new ,  no matter what . 
only downside is that the apple logo on back isn t viewed . 
i can t believe this hand blender is as inexpensive as it is . 
i ordered this for my dad because he needed a new case . 
i ve dropped it several times without a problem . 
i have not had any issues with heat transfer either . 
it was shipped quickly ,  priced right ,  and is well made . 
i find it will drain much more quickly if you leave it connected . 
this size is fairly easy for anyone to use . 
i wonder if this will shorten its life ?  . 
it feels pretty secure with the window resting on it . 
you lift or unscrew the top and enjoy whatever flavorful drink you want . 
they may not be sennheiser s ,  but they have their own identity . 
these knives have literally changed my outlook on cooking . 
i read the reviews on this cover and ordered one . 
it is very easy to use and very user friendly . 
it was worth every penny  !  love it  !  !  . 
still use it today for quick charging of our compatible phones . 
the materials used are obviously of very high quality . 
it is true that the beep is not very loud . 
also you can mount it on a wall or leave it free standing . 
overall i cant really think of anything negative to say about it . 
it s slim fitting and fits my iphone num_num like a glove . 
bought this as a gift for my daughter in law . 
the grinder has never bogged down or clogged up . 
good for blending dry ingredients ,  mixing ,  stirring ,  blending and lifting . 
these are solid and easy to use and do the trick . 
gave to my wife for a gift and it s perfect . 
i am recommending this to all my friends and family . 
pressure cooking changed the way i approach my recipes anymore . 
and every bit as good as my  expensive  egg slicer . 
but once you do get a fashing blue light ,  its on . 
thank you very much for reading my review . 
nothing stick to them and they don t scratch . 
it perfectly fits four big slices of bread in a pinwheel pattern . 
otherwise the case is great for the price . 
i use an electric stove and it is outstanding . 
i also use it when proofing bread ,  no need for plastic wrap . 
they are the weak spot and can easily chip or break . 
used this one time since i received it . 
i used this product in a unique way . 
it heats up fairly quickly and heats evenly . 
i also love the heft of this pan . 
no more garlic smelling hands for days  !  . 
i initially looked at the farberware but unfortunately it was too small . 
it makes a lot of popcorn at once ,  which i love . 
it literally glides under anything you put it under . 
the usb did not work at all the second time i ordered this . 
i show others and my friends have even purchased this case . 
the heat control on it is great and it is easy to clean . 
my wife cut herself a few times after the knife was sharpen . 
some things are nice to have but hardly earth shaking . 
it does not do a great job with potatoes ,  however . 
i guess some reviewers have never experienced really nice ,  really sharp knives . 
it is a great stylus though and is pretty sensitive . 
i highly recommend the machine and give it num_num out of num_num stars . 
the cable that comes with it functions just like oem apple cord . 
i couldn t find any  percolator  grinds at my grocery store . 
bought this for my son and wife for xmas . 
however ,  i would not use the lids to heat anything in them . 
even the utensils which are also high qualitiy . 
this product works good for any micro usb charging jack . 
it s just what i needed for my iphone num_extend
i only started canning this year and this canner is great . 
when it comes to older stains ,  it won t work as advertise . 
if the gray is boring ,  there are bright colors available . 
this is just what it says it is . 
after years of nuking i nearly forgot what real popcorn tasted like . 
i use them for heating water for my daughter s formula . 
love the fat daddio products because many pans come in a num_extend height . 
qvc has it for about $ with shipping in a bunch of colors . 
i works equally well on my wood floors ,  carpet and tile . 
an additional freezer bowl is on my christmas wish list this year !  . 
my sister had given me one of these many years ago . 
i m starting to get used to the metal lids . 
they make a beautiful addition to a table and great for pina coladas . 
one tab was labeled num_num and the other as num_extend
maybe not the best for people with arthritis . 
it does go off by itself after a while . 
i do have a couple of cons but they aren t deal breakers . 
brought new life into a great phone thats over num_num years old . 
they are very nice and i love the grips that are on them . 
very useful when picking what to wear every morning . 
otherwise light ,  controls are easy to reach and distiguish . 
they have come down over the past couple years . 
i had destain for any thing with a toney name . 
i was looking for jars to make my daily oatmeal breakfast in . 
this is very well made ,  heavy and sturdy . 
it is worth the extra time to hand wash all henckels knives . 
this cuisinart food processor is just the right size for two people . 
i ve had it for years and i ve never had any problems . 
i grew up in a farm house with wood heat . 
i bought this num_num years ago and it s still working great . 
so far the suction power has been excellent !  . 
it is easy to use and is used almost daily in my house . 
they are quality soft rubber and seal extremely well . 
bought this current model after checking out several others . 
they worked perfectly in the crust i needed for my chocolate cream pie . 
fit the first time and has held up since . 
these amco advanced performance measuring cups are outstanding . 
would do a replacement unless you know how to . 
doesn t require the food to be chopped or num_extend
so you can follow the whole conversation you ve had with someone . 
the case came in the original otterbox box and was perfect . 
i have found this very useful for trips and traveling . 
normally i drizzle oil on breaded chicken and bake it . 
i change them every three to four months depending on my use . 
it is a medium case that offers some protection with less bulk . 
i purchased this from the oem planet for $ and am quite happy . 
the air flow will eventually gunk up and make the vacuum unusable . 
let s hope it lasts more than a year . 
has numerous connectors for a lot of phones . 
the case looks great and does not add too much heft . 
i even chose to stack to even store more toiletries . 
it s very clingy which is great for my note num_extend
this is an awesome size ,  great quality for the price . 
i have an iphone num_num and it worked perfectly . 
it charges my motorola droid without any problems . 
the build quality appears very good so far . 
it charges my phone quickly and has worked great for on the go . 
the chrome insert really looks like an aluminum finish . 
that s all i care about . i highly recommend this item . 
well ,  as excellent as outside the ear headsets can sound anyways . 
i plug it in every night and charge it . 
i just couldn t be happier with the purchase . 
this has to be one of the most useful kitchen tools i own . 
inexpensive and seems to be of good quality . 
the braun num_extend is a very reliable grinder . 
it s much more useful to me than my roomba is . 
for use in my pressure cooker ,  like a double boiler . 
in my opinion ,  it s a matter of preference . 
get my heart rate as high as num_extend
if you have kids ,  you know that gunk  i . e . 
with the oem battery ,  i was lucky to get num_num hours . 
this is a great ,  light weight cleaning machine . 
paid $ for an num_extend num_num tier version brand name in chinese . 
for some reason i keep losing chopsticks around the house . 
i would definitely recommend it to everyone ,  it is helpful . 
they are thin enough to wear under heavier gloves if needed . 
it has lasted a generation and then some . 
doing a num_num lb loaf however works much better . 
stop searching right now and pick up this oxo steel can opener . 
i take homemade kefir to work each day . 
meat is too expensive to take any chances . 
wow !  !  !  no compair to those conventional toaster ovens . 
my point is that no reviews are necessary for these time proven appliances . 
you can use it with or without a timer too . 
further ,  the individual parts of the processor are easy to clean . 
this simple design works great to peel garlic . 
it is easy to use and quite durable . 
just make sure the outer ring is not on too tight . 
i like this cookie press much better than the metal one . 
most of the other parts i just wipe down with a disinfectant num_extend
i bought a num_num pound turkey and it fit perfectly onto this rotisserie . 
they ever use the same one on the show but a bigger one . 
much better looking than all dial toaster ovens . 
the num_extend when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable . 
i have not had a chance to trouble shoot it yet . 
if you are looking for a flexible turner ,  look no further . 
this battery was for my daughter s phone and it worked . 
the included clock widget leaves something to be desired as well . 
best of all ,  it works like a charm . 
it s bulky ,  but i would sacrifice size for functionality . 
the price is great for this air popper . 
it makes perfect ,  easy to peel hard cooked eggs . 
had this for many years and finally started to deteriorate . 
i m glad i got it and use it frequently . 
this mount has held up great and i highly recommend it . 
oxo good grips products are usually pretty good and these are no exception . 
not a great quality finish ,  but a very durable case . 
i use it for mixing and when i do eggs . 
it is well made ,  and i ve had many compliments already . 
it still looks great on the counter too . 
works as well as the zagg protectors and is much less expensive . 
also keep in mind the clean up time . 
this stylus works wonderfully with all my touch screen devices . 
but overall this is a fantastic machine with a terrific carafe . 
the edges of the corner of your stove basically act like guides . 
highly recommend that you pick up two because you will use them . 
being able to wear around your neck is very handy . 
paranoid about heating my food in plastic containers ,  this is a perfect . 
the size is perfect for a good quantity of noodles . 
i was very surprised how powerful this model is . 
it is well made and the pizza turns out great . 
i also tried hard boiled eggs in it ,  worked great . 
that being said ,  this bluetooth is worth double what i paid . 
also ,  kitchen aid has such great customer service . 
the pot holder is a nice addition ,  and necessary ,  too . 
everyone laughs at my cakes ,  they call them dippy . 
the percolator . sometimes less is more and simple is better . 
it does exactly what i want it to do . 
and ,  in num_extend the life time for this product was done . 
great for listening to music or movies in bed . 
best one i have for when i do my barbq s . 
num_num adults got bellies full with a pint jar of meat . 
it is not something you can put up and take down . 
screws flash photography but i don t use the flash . 
great price works well especially when working out . 
makes it easier and faster to complete any task i need to . 
the curve of the scoop is just right ,  also . 
makes prepping your cookies for the oven faster . 
it fits comfortably and i have found the sound to be excellent . 
i use mine mostly for stovetop dishes that finish in the oven . 
much handier than any hand held cheese slicers or knives . 
the green just adds more of an aesthetic flair to it . 
it is much slower to charge the ipad though . 
all in all ,  this pan can not be beat for the price . 
a lot less expensive then the encase and the same thing really . 
it scratches easy but very comfortable as it is as slim as described . 
so this tea maker makes it a breeze to experiment and be creative . 
so i recommend the product for num_extend work very good . 
this was an amazing price and came in two days !  so great . 
i received what i wanted and am pleased of the product . 
nice small size to heat up soup or make a sauce . 
then use the enclosed cardboard smoother to press out wrinkles and bubbles . 
great product !  !  i always have fresh ,  warm rice daily . 
the only con i see is that it feels too plastic and cheap . 
i have gone three weeks with the motorola ,  and that is enough . 
cool product !  it s a great timer besides the thermometer . 
this product does what it is supposed to do . 
since its my favorite season of the year . 
the soap is gritty and dulls the edge . 
this phone arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised . 
great for tablets ,  bought for my kids ,  definitely kid tested . 
bought this as a gift for a client  i clean his home  . 
i m going to have to find a replacement for the plastic bowl . 
this one is nice i can pick it up easily . 
this vacuum means never having to bend over to adjust the settings . 
if you want to give me something ,  that is what i want . 
i got two sets and use them all the time . 
someone needs to hold the pasta while one person cranks . 
nice and loud for conversations but for music it is a different story . 
this machine produces the fluffiest popcorn i ve ever experienced at home . 
i no longer have to use cooking spray on my baking pans . 
this is the num_extend ronco that i have purchased . 
takes about a minute to get used to the handle . 
very sturdy cookie cutter ,  and seems true to size listed . 
love this grill ,  it s great for pork chops etc . 
been using a blender daily for years and years . 
easy to clean so that we can use it every day . 
i especially like that it will hold up to num_num cups of batter . 
i also purchased the matching bench to sit below the coat rack . 
these are great and i have one of each size . 
loads of compliments when i take cakes from this mold anywhere . 
cannot dock a phone with any shielding or plating on it  invisibleshield works num_extend
they fit perfectly and the hard clamshell case protects them well . 
the battery lasts long on them and they have a very strong range . 
think i will buy some as presents for the holidays . 
they re nice and pretty comfortable in your hand . 
i like that they can handle various temperatures . 
i can see this pot growing in uses overtime . 
it is incomprehensible that there is anything not to love about this mixer . 
i paid twice as much as this one . 
nice practical grill ,  heats very fast ,  cooks evenly . 
finally ,  coffee as it was meant to taste . 
oxo all around  i have found out  has excellent equipment . 
new to canning and this has all i need for a great price . 
i ve been listening to music and talking on it constantly . 
mine came just as pictured ,  but the arrow was red . 
i love it and it is easy to clean . 
it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust . 
i like all of the ball products and this is no exception . 
what more needs to be said ?  they pick up ice . 
tough blender however as its still working fine . 
if i had it to do over that is what i d buy . 
i think the management at prodyne has their customer service perfect . 
they are not as flimsy tpo me as it seemed some reviewers thought . 
there are a lot of things to like about this design . 
i shouldn t have taken so long to recommend these . 
i didn t realize how much i was spending on espressos weekly . 
make sure you squeegee the solution out really well . 
this is the best fitting case i have ever had for a phone . 
was looking for a solution for charging cradle on my desk . 
this battery did the job really well with no problems . 
in short ,  i am glad i made this purchase . 
this is one of four bowls i bought ,  all a different color . 
i have had this immersion blender for more than six months . 
i wasn t entirely sure what i was getting when this spatula arrived . 
the details in the pan are really clear to see . 
dirt cheap and it works like a charm . 
the case protects your phone from just about anything . 
i originally bought a cheaper bobby flay grater at kohl s . 
it also does not rust at all in the dishwasher . 
i love how it s big considering how i love to cook . 
now i can keep a data cable at work and one at home . 
really takes basic cakes to the next level . 
very nice product ,  well worth the money ,  and not that loud . 
this is an excellent pan at a great price . 
that hasn t been an issue with the num_extend
i don t bother putting salt in before the popping . 
semi ripping the cord out in the process . 
i ve been on a search for a good replacement . 
i found this product to be everything it says and more . 
the parts can all be washed in a dish washwer too . 
but i just toss on another from my stock . 
it is light and easy to clean up . 
we have owned a couple of bread knives . 
num_extend never knead dough on a higher speed than num_extend
i am glad i purchased them and like them !  . 
i use it on any vegetable that needs to be diced or . 
this is an effective solution if you need power like i do . 
i wish villaware still made their waffle maker . 
they are very protective when i have dropped my phone . 
this slim bluetooth headset is a slick little piece of technology . 
handle is comfortable ,  as with all the good grips line . 
don t need it often but works like a charm . 
very nice stand it held all my mugs safely . 
this is replacing the same hoover i had . 
that is unless you are military ,  law enforcement ,  construction etc . 
no long handle to get in the way . 
the simple fix :  don t close the lid too tight . 
have not had any problems with this item . 
wish i could buy one for every floor of the house . 
attractive pot but i was disappointed because it is very light weight . 
ok ,  the power switch is too low  see the picture  . 
we love using this large pryex size measuring cup . 
was skeptical when reading all the bad reviews . 
i have one on my i phone now . 
we ve had one of these for years and just loved it . 
fat just roll off the meat and can be drain easily . 
the juicer gets out all of the juice from citrus fruit . 
bulges out around the middle sides a little . 
but ,  for a short call ,  they work fine . 
i definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee . 
it also protects the ports with flaps that sort of snap into place . 
worked like a charm ,  and easy to install !  . 
these things are absolutely aesthetically beautiful and made out of wonderful material . 
products need not be complex to be perfect . 
other than that it seems to be a good item . 
since i purchased this i also bought one for my mother and brother . 
it has a nice texture and isn t too slippery . 
i ve given this as a gift after my great experience with it . 
my wife tried this and gave it to me for christmas . 
nice price . i liked the design and it protects my phone . 
i have a plastic inside and a cloth outside curtain . 
num_num starssoundi was an audiophile as a young man . 
i ll probably break it before the battery stops holding a charge . 
it s a shame for a camera that shoots such quality videos . 
attaches to my kindle fire and my daughter s ipad . 
the heat retention of these pans literally amazes me . 
bought ours a year or so ago for the bedroom . 
i bought this for my son s phone about a year ago . 
this box set is a good place to start . 
i am really glad that i gave the delonghi a chance . 
i am by myself and it is the perfect size . 
one of the purposes i bought the phone . 
i ve only washed this by hand so far . 
easy to clean with scouring pads ,  plastic or otherwise . 
really just a wonderful product ,  feels great and looks great . 
i am glad that i put good money into an excellent product . 
if you re looking for an awesome hand mixer ,  look no further . 
i put them in plastic bags and back into the freezer . 
these worked exceptionally well and are now a staple in my baking experiences . 
once i fixed that problem ,  the loaves have all been fantastic . 
just the right size for soup or vegies for one or two people . 
however ,  it is just one more thing in my purse . 
i gave it to my son who loves it . 
unfortunately the color started fading off from using it one day . 
i d recommend to other  old school  music lovers . 
fotunately you don t have to spend anywhere near that . 
this is one of the better bt headsets that i own . 
i highly recommend you get this for your phone . 
the clip that comes with the stylus fits over the iphone alone . 
since i make several conference calls a day ,  the beeping was unacceptable . 
cleans as well as the rental from the neighborhood grocery store . 
the noise level increases as you adjust the fan to a higher level . 
the speed and quality of juicing ability are amazing . 
would highly recommend nordic ware for its quality . 
as always dealing with amazon was quick and painless . 
finally i have found a toaster oven that does it all . 
the case has a soft feel to it . 
it arrived right on the schedule that amzon promised . 
much better price than the chef supply store !  . 
it has a beveled front edge that slides easily under fried eggs . 
i think that it is worth that price . 
it is of solid construction and doesn t feel cheap . 
the shape makes it only fit in one spot on my stove top . 
this thing will help you save time preping garlic . 
recently i was in the market for a new meat tenderizer . 
i love this thing so much i had to order some more . 
its design is very nice; it even has a retractable cord . 
you have to dry it off after you wash it to prevent that . 
once hooked on ,  i was amazed at how comfortable it was . 
my goal was to get it down with no lint or imperfections . 
but open the cap can let the water boil over num_num degrees . 
i use it to blend the liquids until they thicken a bit . 
we bought this grill in num_num and it is still working . 
these bpa free lids are very convenient and handy . 
i just wish the mesh was a little finer to filter more out . 
i will be coming back for more !  thank you . 
just put the filter in a funnel and it works great . 
i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good grinder . 
i am storing nuts in them on the counter . 
can t beat the price and full quality at the same time . 
good things do come with a small package . 
not to say this french press is flawed . 
you end up  squaring  ice cream out instead . 
i have made coffee for num_num days with this maker . 
bought this for at my window in my shed . 
i hand wash it in hopes that it will last long . 
i purchased this strainer specifically for straining cold brewed iced coffee . 
i have had no problems with them at all . 
i would buy more if i lost mine . 
very glad i made this investment and would recommend to anyone . 
this is a good case for the htc droid incredible . 
i broke the glass piece for my french press . 
i purchased this recently and i have had lots of fun making waffles . 
she sends me a msg everytime she uses them ;  . 
i needed a new wall charger for my droid num_extend
high is to much and the next setting down is not quite enough . 
she it right away and just raved about it . 
it must be a chemical that is used during manufacturing . 
best case out there ,  i am definitely buying again !  . 
it s slim and tall and saves counter space too . 
my mom and grandma have used lodge cast iron cookware forever . 
i liked it so much i got the same brand in a stockpot . 
i use them to keep open chip and pretzel bags closed . 
these headphones are excellent quality for the price . 
have only used it once but it minces very well . 
great thick paper filters !  highly durable ,  won t tear . 
it really increased the hold and comfort in the hand . 
also ,  the musso creates a nice ,  creamy consistency . 
looks like it s doing the job !  it s also very affordable . 
hubby cleaned a huge family room in no time at all . 
this is my second set of henckels in a dozen years . 
this reminds me of the fiesta of my childhood . 
my husband is so happy and he is using it in his cell . 
this particular case is the most common type of them out there . 
anyone who just got their first apartment should have one . 
to be on the safe side ,  i hand wash them . 
wow very good ,  fast and easy to clean . 
bought it for my moms iphone and she loves it . 
i like the design and the feel on this bluetooth headset . 
works great on lenovo num_extend nexus num_extend skyrocket num_extend
my old ones were small and rusting and bent . 
i was clearly wrong and im happy that i got product . 
you can never go wrong with corningware no matter what piece you purchase . 
it works great and i have had no issues . 
but again ,  you cannot overfill the basket trying to get stronger coffee . 
nothing more to be said about a strainer . 
i would recommend this item to family and friends . 
and you can still work with it to get good results . 
the center of the loaf was slightly undercooked . 
i found that my old blue tooth was just palne uncomfortable . 
they fit perfectly in a standard have sheet pan  jelly roll pan  . 
these same people prob break alot of delecate things in thier life . 
other than that ,  it works all the time . 
i paid almost three times the amount offered here for my set . 
i would recommed you to anyone looking to buy protectorss . 
simple to use ,  excellent directions in the included num_extend
put a paper towel over it ,  no mess . 
the one on tv is a piece of junk  no surprise  . 
i have always used my electric mixer for mashed potatoes . 
so far the item seems to be well constructed . 
i have owned mine for probably almost num_num years . 
worth the trouble since it is very compact and quite useful . 
it feels like an appropriate weight to my male hands . 
comes off easy enough if you need to open the phone . 
this is my second bluetooth that i have bought and it is great . 
i have to say ,  that i was really shocked by this rack . 
the handles are comfortable but a little short . 
based on this third hand feedback it gets num_num stars . 
they withstand the dishwasher very well ,  and are virtually indestructible . 
spent a lot of time reviewing and deciding which vacuum to go with . 
i should also note that the clip springs are also very strong . 
i just use the regular coffee but its still good . 
then i wait num_num minutes or so for the adhesive to start drying . 
they easily pick up small and large objects . 
nice product ,  but be aware this thing is big and heavy . 
this would be a nice pot even without the pressure lid . 
it came on time and it is worth the money . 
must have if you want to watch your ipod videos in big . 
i m not sure it was available but i was pretty thorough . 
i couldn t resist getting just one of these bowls . 
they get uncleanable stuff on the bottom and inside of the pan . 
it not only arrived quickly ,  but has made me ecstatically happy . 
i like not having to figure out which side to guzzle coffee from . 
this small machine is a needed item in any kitchen where someone cooks . 
first ,  let me say that i love calphalon . 
i compared many different cases before deciding on this one . 
it was packaged very well to prevent damage to the scale . 
they break after awhile ,  num_num star for a well built aluminum stand . 
this makes them responsible for maintaining their own charging device . 
putting in the dishwasher . i intend to give it as gifts . 
i have had no problems with it at all . 
these work well for filtering the bad taste out of tap water . 
well i have been blown away by their durability . 
i love the overall look and feel of it . 
i was worried about it being wobbly ,  but it isn t . 
but it actually  for me  made the phone feel more robust and sturdy . 
i am partial to smooth cases ,  and the tmobile one is textured . 
was pleased at the quality of this item when received . 
it comes with all sorts of usb adapters to charge other devices . 
well i received it in the mail this morning ,  opened the box . 
that s the difference between num_num bar and num_num bars on the phone . 
i ve used many rubber spatulas and these are the best . 
i m pleased with it and glad that i bought it . 
have used for opening bottles quite a bit . 
replacement lids are available at the corning and revere factory outlet num_extend
ditto ,  if you prefer the crispness of cotton or linen . 
just a little ghee in the pan and they don t stick . 
we couldn t be more pleased with our purchase !  !  !  . 
my dorm has carpet so i think this will be perfect for it . 
this is an extremely stable board when set on a damp towel . 
the headset comes with three  large ,  medium and small  . 
i would say they hold more than num_num load of laundry . 
i am happy with the quality of this strainer . 
and while i love this ,  i still use my moka pot too . 
they do stack so use less space to store . 
i have had this product for num_num years now . 
you can also use this for your tater tots ,  etc . 
it is thin but not as thin as some reviews suggest . 
so i ll be giving it a try then . 
it s very easy to put on your galaxy num_extend smartphone . 
this earpiece works great and has great sound clarity . 
i ve been looking for egg rings like this for a long time . 
i m so glad i finally got one of these . 
i had one ,  bought another one ,  and will buy more . 
i can t say enough good things about this . 
the other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward . 
does not take up much room in the kitchen . 
what an outstanding product to own and have in your kitchen . 
i make a nutritious drink from that each day and love the taste . 
the cake popped right out of the pan and everything was perfect !  . 
this is a car charger that is super small and wonderful . 
and see the internal temp at a glance . 
cooking something starchy like cabbage the first few times will help . 
this phone is more stable in every way . 
i purchased one for myself when i got my incredable . 
so ,  i decided to try a refurbished model . 
it is not meant to be used as a knife . 
they work on everything from cukes for pickles and potatoes for au gratin . 
the readouts and printed labeling are way too small . 
they do not show the best part of this set in the picture . 
i saw this peeler recommended about num_num years ago ,  and got one . 
popped corn fills the cavity and spills out into your bowl . 
very light weight and does the job for a good price . 
this case really looks good on the white iphone num_extend
after a year of everyday use i am still pleased with it . 
i use it to slice mushrooms as well . 
i have to disagree on the battery life however . 
it folds up nicely ,  but doesn t seem too flimsy . 
this is my first salad spinner so take this review as such . 
i think the wilton web site has that posted . 
from a side angle it makes everything blur and darker . 
i received num_num place settings as a christmas gift from my husband in num_extend
no kitchen is complete without a set of pyrex . 
makes excellent coffee and enough for a small group . 
the cast iron holds the heat and heats evenly . 
i will always use chemex filters in my chemex coffee maker . 
so i was sold on all of these things . 
makes a fast num_num cups of coffee and easy to clean . 
i also used this for tamping down strawberries for jam . 
a good stone which makes great breads and pizza . 
sometimes things just work and this does just that . 
and he has only had it a couple of days . 
i don t even need to use oil in the pan . 
i like the feel of it and it fits my phone perfectly . 
i always enjoy numerous cups of coffee in the morning . 
there are several layers of safety features that i really appreciate . 
they lasted the whole time i had the phone . 
the steamfrying feature is nice too for porkchops . 
it looks good ,  has great functionality and excellent price point . 
they are really excellent if you give them a chance and i bought num_extend
the best wine opener i have ever used . 
but i adjusted to that and i m happy with it !  . 
my num_num year old loved these for her birthday . 
i often eat alone and i like to read while doing so . 
i actually bought num_num of these for each car . 
after two broken glass presses i decided to try something else . 
i don t know why you d use anything else . 
it fits perfectly on our lodge num_num inch skillet . 
and so it is with the corner helper shelf . 
other commenters explained in full detail how to use this knife sharpener . 
i bought this for cooking steaks and it is perfect . 
pretty purple color looks deep and rich on my black iphone . 
my other canner is a large presto pressure canner . 
if you re anything like me ,  this just isn t sufficient . 
after that it tastes luke warm and old . 
this was my first purchase with amazon and i love it . 
i ve had this kettle num_num years now and use it daily . 
i have them in all sizes even down to my paring knife . 
my only complaint is that the charge cable is num_extend rather than num_extend
i do feel they should have included a trivet and metal plate . 
i actually had to turn down the sound it is so loud . 
works great just a little loud in my mind . 
just what i was looking for when we remodeled the kitchen . 
sturdy ,  easy to use ,  and doubles as your popcorn bowl . 
the pot cooks well and is easy to clean . 
other than that ,  the case itself is pretty good . 
i did all of these comparative performance tests  e . g . 
very satisfied with this and well worth the money . 
pots ,  pans and other items go on the racks . 
but ,  they work fine ,  no funny taste ,  no deposits etc . 
other reviewer said his died after seven weeks . 
some reviewers commented that the booklet could come with a better instruction . 
i use them for quick breads like chocolate banana and zucchini raisin bread . 
a must have for vegetarians and folks eating raw . 
i thing this is a great product for household use . 
they work great trying to get seafood out of the shells . 
in addition ,  amazon delivers these to fpo addresses . 
i bought it a few years ago for my thanksgiving turkey . 
if you re getting the skillet ,  be sure to get the lid . 
very high quality and well worth the price . 
getting into baking artisan bread requires a unit like this . 
i recently purchased this from my gold box for $
they were easy to clean with soapy water and towel dried . 
the measures are painted in black on the pan interior . 
i bought it and i was right ,  she enjoys it very much . 
ordered these one day shipping  prime  and they arrived in perfect condition . 
it does but it s a tight fit ,  although it performs beautifully . 
i am a fan of oxo products and this whisk is no exception . 
i bought this as a joke without ever intending to use it . 
it s sleeker ,  faster ,  and as functional as ever . 
would buy again in a heartbeat . well done ,  oxo !  . 
the very first time you use it it will burn your sandwich . 
these other reviews about touchscreen issues seems to be a bad phone . 
it is a quality build and has been working well for some time . 
my husband loves coffee and drinks it day and night . 
so it is constantly being dropped and handled roughly . 
they are lighter at the top and darker at the bottom . 
this item is recommended for the busy ,  practical cook . 
i dont think it looks like a real calculator but others might . 
i received the set before the deliver due date and in perfect condition . 
long lasting ,  easy to clean ,  easy to store . 
this is for what i would call the single serving press . 
hopefully ,  this will be something nokia will provide down the road . 
let me tell you that verizon isn t also the problem . 
i like the clear frost so i can still see my phone . 
the control box for answering calls works as designed . 
this nice guage is very easy to read as well . 
very inexpensive and works great for my purposes . 
i should have snapped up a year supply . 
i ve used both silpat and matfer exopat nonstick silicone baking sheets . 
the phone as some serious issues  battery chewing for one  . 
it s nice to have the convenience of using one hand for peppering . 
have bought these as gifts as well as for myself . 
it was just packed in a plain brown box . 
i even use them roll out biscuit dough and to knead bread on . 
the size is perfect for what i wanted it for . 
can t say enough good things about this board . 
so faint ,  they look more dark grey than black . 
the second complaint some have is uneven heating . 
fits real good . i have broken them before but my fault . 
the verizon model is thicker and heavier than the seidio . 
easy to put on ,  no bubbles no nothing . 
i was shocked for the price how high quality this case is . 
after reading a lot of reviews i decided to purchase these . 
they are the best quality knives that we have ever owned . 
this is the best spaetzle maker i have found . 
great because it adjusts to many different battery sizes . 
the filter is exactly as it appears in the picture . 
i ll still use my francis but only for espresso . 
i just kind of went back and forth to get it unstuck . 
pitcher fits nicely in the door of the fridge . 
i guess the best things will be used from generation to generation . 
this makes a perfect num_num ounces of really delicious coffee . 
i own it and use it everyday with no problems . 
i didn t realize how big the item was until i received it . 
as they say ,  this is the cream of the crop . 
i received num_num of these cups in num_num different colors as a gift . 
it is now november num_num and this splatter screen is still going strong . 
i do find that virtually all the kernels pop . 
i love it because when i need to add protector that really works . 
the coffee is very hot ,  but not boiling when it is done . 
if one can love a can opener ,  this is it . 
i love the pan and love the sturdiness . 
good for when you are not allowed to use charcoal or propane . 
that means i need strength ,  durability and flexibility . 
it is sturdy  slightly heavy  and does everything i ask . 
these are my num_extend and num_extend boost cases that i have owned . 
the metal ones with powder coating develop chips and then eventually rust . 
this pan came quickly and was well packaged . 
it works really well and is fast and efficient . 
i stuck this on the window and it has stayed put for weeks . 
and now that i own it ,  it s indispensible . 
these sheets were recommended by cooks magazine ,  and they are awesome . 
so immediately ,  i went on line to look for the cuisinart . 
still for the price you can not go wrong . 
i use it often especially as a last minute veggie steamer . 
i buy these by the dozen to give to friends . 
works well ,  had it on for a couple months . 
this paid for itself after only num_num weeks . 
they peeled right off ,  no goo gone necessary . 
i needed a pitcher for frozen drinks such as minute maid orange juice . 
overall ,  very impressed with the product and the price . 
i drop the phone in this case all the time . 
will be my gift of choice to family members next christmas . 
it is just a bit darker than it looks in the picture . 
and bought this to use on my carpeted stairs . 
i use them to support my cube speakers and they work brilliantly . 
mine were all smooth ,  which was fine with me ,  but fyi . 
it fits in his pocket and has survived drops from various heights . 
but this would have added more weight to the phone . 
i recently upgraded from a henckel international ,  and the difference is profound . 
edges of bowl tapered smoothly for even pouring in any position . 
this meat slicer is certainly the go to machine in my kitchen . 
apparently some of the tomato pushed through the lid and deposited some seeds . 
it gets noisy when it gets too high . 
restaurant quality product ,  but at less than our local restaurant supply house . 
my other machine is going in the yard sale !  !  !  . 
what s left on is the cover on your screen . 
seems to be a nice product haven t used it for very long . 
or try those anker batteries as a spare . 
it is a little tall ,  but worked great in our kitchen . 
from my experience ,  i can highly recommend nordic ware bakers sheets . 
the price was great and they work well . 
it is a large size for the cost . 
only able to get it from their website . 
all i wanted was a can opener that worked . 
this product makes great waffles with the proper consistency . 
i bought this to use when mixing my lye solution for my soap . 
now i have all these mats with all the prepped foods awaiting cooking . 
i like the answering system and the chargeable charger is brilliant . 
i did have one incident and that is with the first cord . 
we do not find the nice blue charging indicators to be too bright . 
it is exactly what i ordered and it is a generic cable cord . 
check out the side swipe beater attachment ,  for the kitchen aid . 
it can also be used to grind dry spices . 
very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration . 
the holster clips on your belt and will also rotate . 
the filters are easy to get to and clean very easily . 
the case feels very sturdy and hard yet it s not bulky . 
i followed the instructions and completely charged and discharged the battery . 
epicurian mixer for the larger size ,  power ,  etc . 
i have read all of the reviews of the most popular bread makers . 
i also think the size is perfect for creating donuts at home . 
this is my second one of these and they re terrific . 
in .  ,  large enough for num_num hamburgers . ; champ num_num sq . 
but if you can spring for a little more ,  buy the farberware . 
this board is just what i needed for my counter work space . 
i got mine on time and as advertised . 
i love that you don t have to worry about plugging this in . 
its not overpoweringly bright ,  but its unnecessary in my opinion . 
no more hassles of toasting buns and dogs . 
white not such a good idea !  other than that great product . 
razr num_extend is old technology and it still works . 
buy this or the num_num inch ,  you won t be disappointed . 
the case only had the tire mark across the back .

like many others ,  i have gone the route of the mr . 
it is light and it is easy to handle . 
the battery came as promised ,  the num_extend version . 
and they protect so that s rly all they need to do . 
this manual can opener works like a charm . 
i think the trickle charge makes the difference . 
it really works well to spread a low flame evenly to the tagine . 
this is the best salad spinner that i have ever owned . 
only downside would be the awkward shape for storage purposes . 
i prefer my bluetooth to not be in the ear . 
very easy to charge you just need a usb cable . 
this chef s knife has changed how i prepare foods . 
for a battery this size ,  i expected more . 
this item works flawlessly ,  and would highly recommend it . 
this is a great turner for lots of things . 
this vinyl table cloth fit fine on our table . 
one of the phone s high points for me is its compact size . 
if you want heavy duty ,  this is it . 
camp chef did it again with a great dutch oven for camping . 
slight orange peel effect as well but no big deal . 
i got this to take advantage of sales on meat and poultry . 
then i unplugged them both from the chargers . 
good size for small jobs and it works well . 
we keep it on the middle console in our mini van . 
this very small speaker packs a big punch . 
good for getting you out of a jam . 
as they were snacks i wasn t trying to keep them cold . 
i use this daily !  clean up is quick and easy . 
so in summary ,  a pretty good product for the price . 
we have been wanting a bunn for years and finally bought one . 
fits my lg num_num g track phone perfectly . 
i couldn t be more pleased with this juicer . 
it is very sturdy and a very modern design . 
i love this mixer ,  so far it has worked really well . 
just read the directions in the booklet and you will be fine . 
the glass is smooth with no sharp edges . 
a deciding factor for me was it is round . 
it is extremely easy to rotate the lid and base . 
it does what i need it to do . 
or just trying to make me feel good about buying her this . 
this is very useful as i hate holdind my phone to my ear . 
has a waxy coating for a nice finish . 
great case ,  but not for someone who bites their nails . 
this thermometer is okay ,  but not quite as advertised . 
not only that but a num_num year old and num_num year old . 
i took my original white one to the office as a backup . 
often water is spilled on the adjacent coffee grounds in the basket . 
would suggest finding some way to attach to phone case . 
this pan gives me a wonderful pizza crust . 
i bought it for my grand daughter as a birthday gift . 
great case for the old htc droid incredible . 
on a side note ,  there are two belt holster options . 
i ve been using since christmas ,  two months ,  just love it . 
i just use my jar sealer and put them in the freezer . 
how i got along without it all this time i have no idea . 
but that was not the fault of the phone ,  but the provider . 
this stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean . 
it has been a year and it is still going strong . 
i received this overnight with num_num day shipping . 
this pan is the greatest for cooking anything . 
sure beats using disposable plastic bags all the time for storage . 
i have also used them for regular cake batter . 
this works perfectly and great price for a beater set . 
do not use just anything to clean them . 
they are holding up as well as i could have expected . 
i wish i had purchased it in the first place . 
i also love that it makes perfect round scoops . 
for the money i think it s a good choice . 
i have had this air filter for about num_num months now . 
there is something about glass that is simply cleaner . 
it sounds clear as if you were on your home phone . 
thanks so much for a great deal on this case . 
she used every one of this color cases . 
i would recommend this to a friend . great buy . 
very good product price is right for me . 
i think the handle is great ,  not too close at all . 
awesomeness . i havnt tried the light up option and probably wont . 
this is a nice set of measuring cups . 
this phone s usability will be extended because of it . 
i love cooking however i despise the prep and cleaning work . 
the best things this is used for is jar products . 
its a really cute case and i got a lot of comments . 
i have had this a month and so far it works great . 
oh ,  and it arrived in only three days . 
i ll give it num_num stars because they didn t include the cable . 
i also kind of like the humming noise it emits . 
it s a great slim case that also gives good protection . 
this is my first spinner and so far ,  so good . 
this one works as advertised and still has the same warranty . 
i would recommend for everyday dish use for everyone . 
you need to follow the instructions carefully when placing it one the phone .

we bought two of these about a year ago . 
they are a nice size and have large easy to see numbers . 
first set of utensils to start my experiences using a wok . 
this carpet cleaner works better than any we ve ever used before . 
it gets the job done and is exactly what i wanted . 
friends are amazed at what a great job it does . 
based on other reviews here ,  i bought two of these items . 
not as good as a house filter ,  but excellent for someone renting . 
i bought lodge made in the usa tenn . 
the screen protector still attracts a fair share of fingerprints . 
its not exactly like the factory one just looks like it . 
each tong is rolled into a `u  shape for added strength . 
the size and shape ,  was easy to attach to my ear . 
i will update this review if i find durability issues . 
it boils num_extend liters in about num_num minutes . 
they cook evenly ,  and a nice golden color . 
this is a great cookie sheet and a nice size .

the only thing i don t like is it is so big . 
i have been looking for something like this for ages . 
i cleaned it with bleach and it came back within num_num weeks . 
this is a good spatula for flipping fish and like things . 
if you want a better scale ,  be ready to spend more money . 
i use it to charge my supposely warp battery . 
the ironing board holder is a great place to store the iron cord . 
i love this size because it s a nice portion . 
we just keep buying more and more attachments for our mixer . 
she said i would love it and she was right . 
print page num_num and master the  tap  ,   press  and  press and hold  num_extend
i had to change the convenient place where i kept my previous charger . 
may look the same ,  but the connectors are the issue . 
that is not the case with this set . 
i am very pleased with these grapefruit spoons . 
the gloss finish on the sides seem to show sweat more as well . 
much lighter so ,  i like that even better . 
bacon can be as crisp as you like without the fat . 
even the desktop cradle fits the extended battery . 
next don t try to grind at a high speed . 
this citrus squeezer is made with quality materials . 
when it has lots of juice left ,  there are three blinking lights . 
i checked amazon s price and ordered one for each of us . 
my iphone has a pretty thick case to protect it . 
another great fiesta piece ,  perfect for large salads and fruit bowls . 
it keeps lettuce dry and crisp in the refrigerator . 
you can watch it mix ,  knead ,  and rise and bake . 
still ,  for the right use this is perfect . 
they will cut through chicken breasts with ease . 
i used these to make cupcake toppers for my daughters birthday . 
i can t find a num_num degree angle that goes to the left . 
you need to clean these units after each use . 
a sideboard with a decanter and a soda siphon . 
 i think all grinders will exhibit the same problem  . 
this blocked the mic so everyone i talked to complained about the quality . 
it is quite small and means you need to refill it pretty often . 
the handle gives a good grip ,  the prongs grasp the onion securely . 
there isnt really much else to say about a car charger . 
i ve used it a few times and it s been great . 
i am hoping that this machine lasts longer than my previous mixer . 
this attachment takes up very little room when it is being stored . 
this unit makes decent coffee but not quite as good as the braun . 
with this baby you turn it on and it will suck everything down . 
it fits the phone great even with a relatively think screen protector . 
i use it all the time and it is an exellent handsfree unit . 
just don t get too attached to the color . 
we prepare quite a few homemade meals and this has helped tremendously . 
that was it ,  everything else came back positive . 
it s a quality item and there s no faking that . 
the navigation isn t always as intuitive as i would like to see . 
this case provides the perfect compromise between size and protection . 
i think anyone getting a eureka num_extend should get this . 
i bought this from amazon and couldn t be happier . 
the settings ,  especially the cancel button ,  are great . 
of flour but i can live with that . 
the pyrex round storage bowls stack nested to save space . 
he s a landscaper and couldn t risk dropping it . 
will come off when taking it out of your pocket . 
i d recommend this product to anyone considering a purchase . 
positive engaged clips leave no room for pointy bits sticking out . 
our friend told us that she got it from amazon . 
some people have dinged this product because it is small . 
i am very happy with them and so far have no rusting problems . 
i use this brand of scoop in other sizes . 
very happy with this case for my num_extend
i wish there was a fill line instead of a middle square . 
i can t recall it coming off by itself . 
it made a lot more than i expected . 
i think i bought this ten years ago . 
planning to buy one for every room my kids will be in . 
headset is small and light no issues wearing . 
it may cost a little more ,  but well worth the price . 
i myself own one of these and use it all the time . 
they see daily use and pretty much daily washing . 
now i use it to sharpen all my kitchen knives . 
as the title says this is the best blender i ever bought . 
this is the perfect vessel to hold my starter . 
they pans are light and deep and they love them . 
he was using this exact pan for the job . 
additionally ,  the dust cup doesn t lie snugly against the body . 
this was just what i expected when i ordered it . 
i am going to try and find another one of these . 
weighs a ton ,  so plan to keep it out . 
i gave it away so decided to upgrade when getting another . 
hot paninis and a mug of steaming soup . 
good blades ,  they even work in my dazey stripper . 
just about to buy my num_extend  for num_extend member of the family  headset . 
it works well for serving one person but that s about it . 
i put meat in it and dump marinade on top . 
it is light and seems to me like the original one . 
there s enough space for the all three hardware specs . 
it screws on perfectly and is ready to go in seconds . 
these appear to be thick ,  strong ,  and solid . 
i don t know if they suck up battery life or cpu usage . 
the suction power on this thing is very impressive . 
it s sturdily built yet lightweight and the perfect size . 
and the great part is ,  i can do four at a time . 
now i can charge my ipad num_num in my truck . 
it gets super hot and sears the steak super fast . 
the handles are made of wood and are specially treated . 
i ve used it for a year and have been really pleased . 
so i took a chance on this machine . 
so this is perfect and enjoy watching it being made . 
they are small offices with newer carpeting for the most part . 
this is a sleek ,  sharp ,  durable pizza cutter . 
after several years of use ,  i m still happy . 
the wine tasted awesome !  same flavor profile with even more rounded tannins . 
this attached perfectly to our kitchen aid mixer . 
i didn t worry about my stuff slipping out . 
there isn t much more to say than that . 
this battery is pretty compact and does not weigh that much . 
without much pondering ,  i went and purchased a sony ericsson num_extend
it came in less than a week in the mail for less than $
screen protector included in the design and extra protection !  . 
you can easily cut thin pieces from this knife without much effort . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
unfortunately i do not have a central unit . 
i think it s a great mug and i highly recommend it !  . 
i got a kick out of the negative comments to this item . 
it s easy to clean and looks nice on the counter . 
this is a tool i ve been wanting for a while . 
i initially didn t bother with the included screen protector . 
both of these features make this so convenient . 
holds more than you think and tidies up the area nicely . 
i recived this bread maker for mother s day . 
for the price ,  i wish shun would have provided a holder . 
i was very impressed with how this mixer handled . 
this is a geed low priced solution to verizons rather high prices . 
much better than all the mr coffee s i ve had . 
the edges are rolled as well for added strength . 
note that the size is a bit on the large side . 
wish i would have bought one of these num_num years ago . 
i ve been using a foodsaver for many years and swear by it . 
i ve made beans ,  and bbq pulled pork so far . 
if i could rate it num_num stars ,  i would !  . 
 i live on acreage  i can now use my stove as prep areas . 
this makes popcorn in its own attractive bowl and also cleans easily . 
however i have found that the fuller the pot the hotter it stays . 
bento jar  and a spoon ,  though i prefer to carry chopsticks  . 
brews up a cup of coffee fairly quickly . 
the num_num is the most comfortable for me . 
also ,  i haven t tried to clean upholstery with it yet . 
the plastic that the ear hooks are made out of are very cheap . 
they are light weight and make it easier to hold onto . 
i ve has my home key fall out twice . 
it is powerful enough to blow whatever out from where ever . 
guess this is why this case is called the breathe  better ventilation  . 
you can search the term  canola oil  and  circulon  on the web . 
on the one hand ,  it makes it really easy to put on . 
i ve needed one of these for a long time . 
the same as you see on many of the  food network  shows . 
i use this for my spoon rest to . 
as good as more expensive calphalon for my use . 
i am emptying the cannister almost every two weeks . 
several of them have already had to fix their cracked screens . 
heavier weight then i thought they would be . 
quick and easy and fits well on my big ears . 
this spaetzel maker is very easy to use . 
i didn t know what it was and pressed in . 
i expect these will outlast a lot of other items in my kitchen . 
i may not go back to my other roasting rack !  . 
some similar cables do not work on this phone . 
not bright enough to be a real bother ,  but close . 
use them all the time since i do a lo of microwave cooking . 
love the fact that it has three power settings too . 
it is under $ you get what you pay for in most cases . 
it is ,  however ,  very well built and looks great . 
peel it off ,  throw away and try again . 
buy it for the case itself ,  which is great !  . 
a very handy tool ,  and not a gimmick . 
we use it to heat formula from the fridge . 
i have various peppers and in this pepper mill ,  the colors pop . 
consumer reports num_num rated this vaccuum a best buy . 
this is one of the better sets that we have used . 
i purchased the nordicware num_num microwave popcorn popper in early december from amazon . 
and it does make great great froth i would recommend this product . 
i use this case on my phone everyday . 
duhi ll have to report on it s popcorn making qualities . 
this thing will almost fit in your wallet . 
however ,  it wont work to mince pieces of ginger . 
while researching a replacement coffeemaker i stumbled across reviews for percolators . 
and i have now used the upholstery cleaner hose and attachment . 
wish i had found it num_num presses ago . 
plus it also protects my iphone because i tend to drop if often . 
you can count on hot and strong coffee each time you use it . 
does not seem to corrode much ,  and feels confidently robust . 
this works perfectly fine for the iphone num_extend
and i may never need to buy another one . 
works proper and extra ear gels come in so very handy . 
cuisinart has always been a favorite brand of mine . 
does what it was made to do ,  cut out doughnuts . 
it does what it says it will do and does it well . 
no more burnt coffee that s been heated for hours . 
i have a hard time getting it in and out of my pocket . 
don t waste your time and money on other units . 
love the beautiful bright colors offered in these phone covers . 
it has a nice flex to it which is perfect . 
it s nice to have my mophie juice pack as a back up . 
the memory to run programs is about num_extend
we recently replaced our old one after almost num_num yrs . 
this little  mighty mite  packs a big punch . 
this percolator is well made and very sturdy . 
the us cup is defined to be num_num oz . 
can hold up to three cards and i never had anything fall out . 
i keep it stored in oven when not in use . 
it really seemed to retain very little grease . 
been slicing like a pro ever since these things came in . 
dropped my iphone by accident and it protected it good . 
this is a reliable and durable kitchen tool . 
you have to slide the case down to charge the phone . 
i used them right away and my husband loved his taco salad . 
i thought it would be a bit bigger ,  thus the num_num stars . 
thank you so much for this bargain and the great value and quality . 
unlike calphalon cookware ,  it can go in the dishwasher . 
i have it hanging from an overhead cabinet on my wall . 
this juicer will help you maintain a health lifestyle . 
so much so that it scratched up my enamel stove top . 
i have to reset it by taking the battery num_extend
no more renting the machines from the store . 
this is nothing fancy but just a very practical charger for apple products . 
it does not require a lot of space it gives protection . 
it s razor sharp and a work of art . 
i use this almost every night and it works great . 
it also looks good on the kitchen counter . 
i also prefer silicone combined with fiberglass  try matfer  for my oven liner . 
and so i used the gift certificate from amazon . 
i luv the mophie juice pack air case and rechargable battery . 
i used it for one slow cooker meal and liked it . 
great for berries ,  lettuce ,  anything you want to wash . 
although they are expensive ,  you will never replace them . 
the two different sizes are why i use this one . 
he makes all kinds of things with it . 
amazed at the quality especially for the price . 
this item charged my phone three time ever time . 
i just hope the lids hold up to the pyrex name . 
i like the stand in the back also . 
i am very pleased with these especially after my num_extend jaybirds quit working . 
keeps the wine from becoming too much like vinegar . 
we bought this because we sometimes make beef jerky . 
so glad i bought from here n not the store . 
but they do tell you when your battery is getting low . 
the feel is like a normal screen and it s clear . 
i only wish i had found it a long time ago !  !  . 
it heats up in few minutes and keeps the feet warm . 
they are as happy with this blender as i have been . 
if anything it give you an extra hour at the most . 
i did more research into the factors that go into brewing coffee . 
num_extend so its not too big on the counter . 
good accurate bass ,  nice mids and clear highs . 
the amazonbasics case ,  on the other hand ,  feels nice to touch . 
i use it for eggplant for veggie lasagna and eggplant parmesan . 
i received my motorola num_extend several weeks ago and am delighted with it . 
the case is very slim and does not have any rubber . 
exremely sharp ,  comfortable handle ,  keeps a good edge . 
i like using it cause it keeps the screen from scratches etc . 
it fit the phone very well and held up at least a year . 
if it s nighttime and cloudy you ll see dark sky and clouds . 
the lid also stays on much better than on my other pans . 
it looks great ,  appears durable ,  and has a great form factor . 
this product is as great as they described it . 
i just hope oxo expands the line with even larger sizes . 
i used elmers white glue for to set up the wooden dowls . 
that should be standard for coffeemakers ,  not an extra . 
but if you like quesadillas ,  this is worth it . 
these are the best quality storage containers i have ever owned . 
deadlines cannot be negotiated ,  and so my labor continued . 
everything you will love in espresso will be in this . 
i can t believe i hadn t bought one sooner . 
the grips aren t really necessary ,  but they are nice . 
so for now it is a great device that deserves your consideration . 
tried using the first one and was confused why it wouldnt work . 
this was key for me . the cellphone reception is excellent . 
i ve never seen a screen protector that had such a fancy packaging . 
i now know axactly where my pens are at all times . 
it could not be easier to use and will pay for itself quickly . 
that mr coffee has to make the world s worst cup of coffee . 
that same day i bought one for myself . 
this is the perfect solution for my problem . 
i bought to protect my sony xperia play and it worked good . 
it grinds beans and does so pretty well . 
add the cake flour and stir slowly until all flour is moistened . 
i m happy with the decision because there are some slight differences . 
 wilton aluminum num_num cup mini muffin pan   ,  thanks to wilton and amazon . 
the lids seal very tightly ,  especially the smallest ones . 
so all i can tell now is that it works . 
this is one of my favorite kitchen purchases to date . 
very satisfied with this little chopper and just the size i was needing . 
its really cute and got lots of compliments on it . 
it heats up instantly and responds quickly to the stove tops heat settings . 
loved them so much i bought this set . 
as good as allclad  i have them both  and looks as good . 
and i am weakling ,  so that is saying something . 
plus it fits nicely in the cabinet ,  space saver !  . 
it was the perfect size ,  it fit completely from top to bottom . 
now ,  they stay fresh for about num_num days . 
i bought this when i got an offer from amazon kitchenaid products . 
this one is really attractive and it works great . 
by listening  . so how does it cook ?  average ,  i guess . 
the quality of the butcher s twine is great . 
this is not the fault of the knife . 
the price was low and these are cut precisely . 
my husband and myself have the protective shield on our phones . 
a little off topic ,  but just putting that out there . 
here s the original review : i like the knife very well . 
not fabulous ,  not sophisticated ,  not fragigle and not expensive . 
it consistently brews a wonderful cup of coffee easily and efficiently . 
it came completely depleted and took about num_num hours to charge . 
the screw in type obviously hold up better . 
if you love assembling things and have patience ,  go for this project . 
the oxo good grips flexible vegetable brush does just what it says . 
so ,  you re basically making a  tall ,   num_num oz . 
i love oxo handles !  they are so comfortable to do kitchen work . 
it really helps clean up easy ,  if you use it every day . 
this electrolux dlx remains the workhorse of the kitchen . 
they are of high quality ,  are easy to grip and very sharp . 
what a difference in the evenness of the cooking . 
would i buy it again ?  in a heartbeat . 
it is the biggest one i got now . 
it plugs in the cigarette outlet and charges your phone . 
but it is a nice case to keep the scratches off . 
awesome calm quality ,  unmatched by any bt headset i ve used . 
my husband was also really impressed with its construction . 
it comes from china so expect a couple week wait to get it . 
but i don t think a single coffee grinder out there does this . 
works perfectly with a large amount of air flow . 
this mandoline does everything a hundred dollar stainless french tool does . 
you re cautioned to use spray if you wash it in the dishwasher . 
i really am very pleased with these pitchers and would definitely recommend them . 
better than dripping stuff across the floor to get to the main trash . 
i used this for the first time last weekend . 
had it for several months now and it still looks good . 
makes great toast with butter and cheeze on it . 
you have to read and follow the instructions very carefully . 
got this at target on clearance for less than amazon price . 
some people are confused about the use of metal utensiles on stainless steel . 
other then seeing specks on my screen it works great !  . 
i d say it is a winner in my book . 
so if your case warps ,  otterbox will replace it . 
i use it every day for scooping up cooked vegetables from my wok . 
a little difficult to put on and off the phone . 
seriously i get insanely frustrated cuz it happens a lot . 
i was really impressed with the quality of this cable . 
i lost one in the garbage disposal as a result . 
undergarments and the such are ideal for these hangers . 
i got this little chopper to save time on preparing salad vegetables . 
the shape and engineering of the product doesn t allow for messy uncorking . 
i even passed it on to my gf . 
i actually appreciate the lighter weight of this pot . 
haven t had to change a belt yet ,  however . 
i have two of these that i use consistently . 
the stainles version is the only way to go . 
so some work flawlessly ,  and some have issues . 
this is a reusable parchment paper that works great . 
also like that it is adjustable for different size cans . 
the auction claimed it was in perfect condition and worked fine . 
it is next to impossible to pour without dripping . 
my brother recommended this and i love it . 
got these and they came in perfect shape . 
it is a perfect companion to your electronic devices . 
the no color butter flavoring worked great for butter mints . 
the price was the best i could find ,  no shipping charges . 
for the low price ,  i definately recommend this item . 
we had on a long time ago and it was good . 
the tops fit well and the bowls are of good quality . 
just really well popped popcorn you can flavor however you like . 
great to chill and then toss your lettuce or fruit salad too . 
but that is an inevitable consequence of the essential design . 
now i have to remember how to cook omelets properly . 
you and your family can feel safe eating off these . 
i suggest buying reusable silicon cupcake wrappers to partition off the containers . 
i can always put on a sweater ,  but my feet would freeze . 
i purchased this knife on the recommendation of cook s illustrated . 
since i am nuts about coconuts ,  i had at it . 
everytime i use it i feel like the axe is new again . 
i have two but find that i could use two more . 
i haven t owned an air popper since before microwaves . 
use it for straining milk from our cows . 
two tea bags in the resivoir and you are good to go . 
my only real negative is that i wish it had a longer cord . 
my wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference . 
i found out the hard way that not all microusb cables will work . 
tired of glass bodum s that have a lousy seal . 
i got the tall dresser for my husband and this one for me . 
my parent s kirby lasted my entire childhood  though it did cost alot  . 
don t buy one expecting to throw away the paring or chef knives . 
it s the exact same grinder and does exactly what it should . 
the case fits very well ,  yet is easy to remove . 
this is just an ac adapter for a koolatron cooler . 
the cord is also longer than most other chargers . 
and we ve spent well less than they price them online . 
first pair of shears broke when trying to cut the spine out . 
be careful ,  however ,  not to fold or crumple the bags . 
i just wish they made one with a ear clip that stays on . 
they have a high quality construction that feels like it will really last . 
but the pattern wore off much faster than expected . 
the high speed if really powerful for a hand held . 
charged my spare battery for my evo flawlessly . 
love it !  everyone should have one of these . 
so i thought why not try this contraption . 
awesome headset !  used it many many times with no problem . 
this is the second care charger i ve had in as many years . 
and you know it s going to last unless you break it . 
i liked this measuring cup so much that i bought a second one . 
i would have rated these knives num_num stars if not for this issue . 
this item works best if the contents are cold before starting . 
my old one used to fit in my silverware drawer . 
the instructions should have said  :  avoid additional and repeated creasing . 
these are helpful in making fruit rollups and dehydrating sauces . 
as stated on all the others this is a great buy . 
and over time ,  scratches might show easily as well . 
we have had great coffee from this machine from the beginning . 
they are always a varying level of quality or features . 
now here is a big advantage to this cast iron cook ware . 
these were bought for my husband to use on his phone . 
the screen is surprisingly clear and the keyboard is definitely improved . 
it s not big but meets the needs of our two person household . 
this is a great iron and clearly out of production or discontinued now . 
this was recommended by cook s country ,  and it doesn t disappoint . 
they are rated for either baking or freezing . 
these are the first real problems i ve had with this phone . 
this is the best grater i ve ever used . 
it goes on easy and you can t tell it s even there . 
i turn on the roomba and go upstairs . 
i like it so much that i just purchased the matching creamer . 
nice to have a little basket for silverware on the other side !  . 
i have used it well and all but once it ran flawless . 
the only limitation this slicer has is its size . 
may buy one do actually do pasta with . 
i store this bad boy in the bottom drawer of my oven . 
it worked well ,  and lasted for about three years . 
i hated having a long cord spread across my car . 
the water tastes the same as our previous filter ,  which is great . 
these measuring cups can go in the microwave and dishwasher ,  no problem . 
the price was so good i order two ,  to have a spare . 
the top from the original fits on this replacement just fine . 
once it s in my ear ,  it stays put and works great . 
this was so inexpensive for the quality and size . 
however ,  for the price ,  this was worth purchasing again !  . 
this was ok for me ,  as all my chargers worked fine . 
the silicone spatula is flexible but not flimsy . 
and i couldn t make my crispy bacon skillet bread without cast iron . 
it s well made and convenient to carry with me . 
they always cook their bacon in the oven . 
i dropped it several times and it never broke . 
i use this for small jobs around the kitchen and it works well . 
for me ,  and my family ,  this is a good deal !  . 
to stay on my ears during a run . 
i believe i have every piece they make . 
i have installed num_num of these in my cars . 
it s called  safeheat ,   but it is nowhere close to safe . 
i just got the batteries and the charger . 
this is a very nice leather case for the iphone num_extend
no issues so far ,  solid product and a reasonable price . 
it was very easy patching to my iphone num_extend
protects my phone from slipping from my hands . 
at this price ,  i can order plenty of back ups . 
but that extra care is worth the way the food can be handled . 
the quality of this set offsets the price . 
i would assume it must be capable of boiling . 
i liked the fact that the bacon actually cooked evenly ,  both times . 
this pan is the best cheesecake pan i ve used . 
the case expanded for my thundbolt with the large battery pack . 
no issues at all reported and appears to be factory . 
i ve used other garlic presses and this is the best . 
i have had many sleep filled nights since i plugged it in . 
i drop this phone every once in a while and it still works . 
as good knives go ,  it is a bargain . 
it stays piping hot  with steam  for at least five hours . 
the case is easy to put on but difficult to take off . 
i coat them with pam and things come out easily . 
it doesn t have a day light saving feature . 
i am surprised at the quality for the price . 
this is my first baking stone and it works as advertised . 
i love this knife because i can spread and cut with it . 
i have friends whoneeded gasket for their blender . 
not sure if i like the front of it or not . 
my friends say it hurts their eyes but i like it . 
so it does work it all depends on the angle they re at . 
this is the best phone with a keyboard ,  boost has . 
i have since received another from a friend in the color of black . 
with the profile program it solved my problem with auto mute . 
some of the best money i ve ever spent for the kitchen . 
i have now just doubled the life of my phone . 
i will see if it protects as well . 
i ve had it for about num_num months now . 
so far ,  these are perfect for my cooking needs . 
card was new as promised ,  no problem with activation . 
the prongs swizzle to accomodate how your electric plug is num_extend
this cover has appropriate cutouts for the camera and speaker . 
this thing is a workhorse for all kinds of veggies . 
num_extend i would have preferred a smaller form factor . 
small size and slide out arms make it great . 
charges a dead battery before the charged battery runs out . 
the plastic is fairly sturdy and mine is going strong after three years . 
all small things and do not affect function . 
they are wonderful and excellent quality and hold plenty . 
pay attention to the markings on the body . 
i mainly use this to juice pomegranates and love it . 
these are wonderful !  i use one size constantly for biscuits . 
attach to studs on drywall or use wall anchors . 
after i tried it i bought two more . 
these mugs are just what i asked for . 
she was surprised and excited when they showed up on the doorstep . 
it is the most efficient juicer for oranges that we have tried . 
i like the retro look and the simplicity of operation . 
i made the big mistake of buying cheap $ for the samsung product . 
he liked it ,  but i never used it . 
luckily ,  it doesn t disconnect my calls when it loses battery power . 
potatoes should be very crisp ,  they ll cut easier . 
nice instrument for grinding and it is quite simplistic and beautiful . 
i have read that the kitchenaid ravioli roller is an equal disaster . 
gave the mikasas to younger friends and we re both happy . 
it seems i jumped the gun a bit . 
just the opposite ,  my husband and i love our steamer . 
i ve never had one of these to fail . 
one draw back was that they are no longer manufacturing the num_extend  bummer  . 
overall ,  you can t go wrong for the money . 
a little oil prevents it from being to dry for flavoring to stick . 
i use two even measures using the scoop provided with the press . 
the entire unit is solid and nicely constructed . 
the battery life is great to say the least . 
the black silverstone spatula s work the best for removing waffles . 
this fits nicely on our old verizon iphone num_extend
or it s my problem to put it on . 
i love the case and feel so secure having it !  !  . 
they arrived in brand new in nice packaging ,  within a box . 
it s the best you can get for this price range . 
it works great though if you re looking for one !  . 
i just bend them a little and the wire slips right in . 
the handles are large enough to make holding them comfortable . 
kitchen ,  bathrooms and wood floors are a snap . 
i set the hot pan on a trivet on my counter . 
a dock for my htc inspire num_extend with and extra battery charging slot . 
on one hand ,  it could be a good device . 
it should manage to work its way into shower gifts . 
these are the perfect size for my kitchen . 
this is what i ve always thought a bluetooth headset should be . 
rather than using my knife to scoop things off the cutting board . 
she had done canning before using a different method . 
the only thing is that it has a very tight seal . 
like my slippers are slick on the bottoms . 
hard to rate a dough hook ,  it works or it doesn t . 
i ve never been the kind of guy that s easy on electronics . 
so i bought this whole unit to replace it . 
i feel that the plastic isn t very sturdy . 
i noticed some folks warning of the set s lighter weight . 
sometimes we want another cup of coffee after num_num hours . 
i wish i had purchased one of these years ago . 
two batteries should get you through the day . 
within minutes i had just enough finely grated chocolate to serve my purpose . 
makes great coffee and has all the features you need or want . 
the long handles and rubber grips keeps hands from getting hot . 
the price is also unbeatable so it s a great value as well . 
the also can be stored separate or on ring . 
it does charge an ipad and iphone at the same time . 
just swipe the blade through it several times . 
it s slightly triangular ,  which means it s pretty comfortable to grip . 
the controls are intuitive and easy to see . 
a fun gadget that would make a nice little gift . 
for as long as i can remember i have wanted this griddle . 
the metal is not my favorite this works for now . 
the wire had snapped ,  and they were too fine to repair . 
this is the  flip  part that the item refers to . 
this screen protector is excellent and is extremely clear and barely noticeable . 
this works great and gives drinks a nice and smooth tecture . 
we reordered our old favorite and were surprised to receive this new model . 
it is rugged and has alreadysurvived several drops . 
this is the second coffee pot we have ordered . 
item works well but is a little pricey for a simple cone . 
used for church dinner and they worked very well . 
this is the gold standard for blade sharpening . 
works great so i can make perfect waffles !  . 
my wife uses to keep grease from splattering . 
it gets much more use than the larger cuisinart . 
it fits flush against the bed ,  and is very sturdy . 
the machine works really fast and is not difficult to clean . 
all the ports are properly lined up except for the earphone jack . 
but i tuck my shirt in so it doesn t bother me . 
it slices through the hardest crusted bread and it cuts very straight . 
i am very impressed with amazon s version of iphone accessories . 
each one seemed to have their pros and cons . 
i ve been looking for a cast iron skillet and found lodge products . 
got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he was so excited . 
it is also thick on the bottom to keep butter from scorching . 
this is not an otter box but it just as good . 
toast darkness is very similar from slice to slice . 
enough room to steam enough milk for two cappuccinos . 
both devices can be connected at the same time . 
i love all the unique sizes that these have . 
don t know why you d buy any other grinder . 
great shopping experience !  as stated ,  it does not come with hardware . 
i prefer to toss this one into the dishwasher . 
i have only had this one day ,  but i am in love . 
helps me say fully charged throughout my busy days . 
the muffins are not large ,  but sized like the standard muffin tin . 
we like the large size for almost everything we drink . 
this is a very nice looking and high quality coffee grinder . 
if you own a thunderbolt ,  you need one of these . 
in my case ,  the handle was not too narrow for my hand . 
he said that it was just as it described . 
love the see through lid and the built in strainer . 
our village community center has these types of classes all the time . 
this item is clearly the best microwave unit on the market i believe . 
coffee will do the job as both drinks call for little foam . 
the ability to store the dry lettuce in the spinner is a plus . 
i sometimes have to press it multiple times . 
finish is excellent ,  a brushed stainless that looks nice . 
i use it all the time and recommend it . 
you will feel like a pro in no time . 
on the raised silicone button ,  there is a red painted square . 
i prefer one of these over a can opener . 
fiesta is timeless ,  and can be used for informal or formal meals . 
i m sure that the review of the material ,  etc . 
these are comfortable and the sound quality is great . 
what can you say ,  it opens my cans effortlessly . 
they charged me $ for a replacement but here s the thing . 
a mac will probably be my next buy . 
the result is whatever i am making doesn t stick . 
i also bought a second one for a cabin up north . 
i ordered these for the holidays and gave some to the family . 
dirt cup is small ,  but not a big deal to empty . 
i ordered this vacuum nearly a year ago and absolutely love it . 
it might be good to have a rubberized or textured outer case . 
i also like the fact that it keeps food dry and airtight . 
plus i like that it s made of wood because it looks neat . 
yet ,  after first use ,  my hesitations were gone . 
buy it if you think you need it . 
i was very sceptical when i first saw this thing . 
the blade and disc holder does what it says it will . 
bought the flair and happy that i did . 
very easy to clean the lid and base . 
but does get in the way sometimes . i like it . 
i ordered it by standard shipping from best n price and surprise surprise . 
only reason for num_num stars is because of the price . 
the only flaws i see with this product num_extend
i have a basic gas burner stove top . 
i am a real stickler for iphone screen protectors . 
you can unscrew it and remove the handle . 
highly recommended for anyone with a toddy maker . 
see my review of the lid fo more detail . cleaning tip . 
you could experiment yourself just to be sure . 
drape num_num paper towels over the top to minimize mess in the microwave . 
the plug feels solidly built ,  and not cheap in anyway . 
these are stamped blades and thinner than some . 
all come with a cloth to clean first . 
you will be very glad you did . powersupport sells several different sets . 
the voyager num_num is very comfortable to wear and was easy to setup . 
this thing is a great idea from ronco . 
very flexible and can fit as u num_extend
i like the pressure valve much better than the other cooker i had . 
this is a great tool in the kitchen . 
while it worked ,  it was a  can t be without  tool . 
the instructions are clear and the cooker is well made . 
there isn t much to say except this cable works as advertised . 
there are two layers of the case also . 
love the carry strap and zipper !  oh yeah this is great . 
it is exactly what is shown in the picture . 
the device is really nice and compact and appears fairly sturdy . 
you will need to get screen protectors seperate but thats okay . 
i also purchased press papers to help keep patties from sticking together . 
the proximity and light sensors actually work and work well on this phone . 
paid more and it doesn t work as well . 
this is our second spinner of this type . 
it provides basic protection at a good price . 
the can opener requires some practice to get the hang of num_extend
the skins come off very cleanly and with little effort . 
i ordered this late wednesday night and it came in the mail today . 
i own the smaller size too ,  and use it daily . 
now ,  its $ a piece for these things . 
love the large size ,  the fact that clean up is easy too . 
it toasts well  most times  ,  is easy to use and seems durable . 
you can buy the most expensive gourmet corn for really tasty num_extend
now every bar of soap is the same size . 
looks like a sleek iphone james bond used . 
moreover ,  the price is very reasonable and i am very satisfied . 
i also use it to mince garlics ,  too . 
this item is well made ,  and the materials are of good quality . 
i couldn t believe they are still being manufactured . 
this might be the quietest hepa filter i ve owned . 
she is older so it fits for her and works well . 
and it has two layers of protection which appealed to me . 
this replaced a very similar braun that failed when a plastic part failed . 
the call quality is wonderful due to the noise cancelling . 
i made mine into a cute fish bowl . 
it is even pleasing to hold this pounder in one s hand . 
i am no expert ,  but we got this and absolutely love it . 
i m buying the hamilton beach . it has worked perfectly . 
i ve been using the foodsaver for two years now . 
this was to get rid of any remmants of the die cast metal . 
it charges my phone faster than my charger at home . 
do you drink alot of coffee ?  if yes then dont get this . 
i would buy it again !  the service was wonderful too !  . 
i would definitely purchase again if i found the need . 
i can t believe it took me so long to buy it . 
though it s not a perfect fit ,  it s % there . 
yes it is heavy ,  but its good weight in my opinion . 
i tried to sharpen my serrated bread knife and ruined it . 
expensive but it lasts a year with sensible use . 
pops well without all the additives of prepackaged popcorn . 
you should get one works with i phone and num_extend phone . 
with ball jars that is ,  haven t tried them with other brands . 
i did try and make a call and that was so so . 
this case is the top of the line . 
but that s the way it does with any hard case . 
list is $ can t beat it at that price . 
i decided to go with solid steel  but not spend too much money  . 
i drive a ford expedition using a blackberry num_num torch phone . 
because its made from bamboo it will also help protect the knifes . 
it uses a regular micro usb connector and charges the batters as expected . 
the product is made in china but looks like made in usa . 
i ordered a small zipper case elsewhere on amazon . 
the answer to these questions is a yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
video recording is also quite good ,  for a phone . 
i received my otterbox in a very short time period . 
the inside of the lid rusts nearly instantly . 
there is no better option available for zesting citrus than the microplane classic . 
doesn t become yellowish with the time like a lot of others . 
the cups and pitcher were very pretty and solid . 
blends well ,  cleans up well ,  parts haven t rusted . 
the higher amp usb port charges our ipod touch with no problems . 
once i did ,  however ,  the phone functions perfectly still . 
i wish i d realized before i tried it in my miele . 
i wanted something inexpensive but sturdy enough to get there and back . 
basically ,  the finer the grind ,  the messier it gets . 
i bought this and gave it to my mom . 
and the stand is still strong and holding . 
the third is the thick cover i was referring to . 
the blade does not get gooky with dried food and require num_extend
also if a smoker uses it ,  it works great . 
the wood is lovely and the brass rivets look like quality . 
repairman told me he gets lots of carpet cleaning machines in for repair . 
this was a great find !  good price ,  nice product . 
i like oxo products because of the rubber grips . 
a good investment are the handle covers ,  silicone or pot holder type . 
it was delivered in my mailbox on saturday afternoon . 
it works great !  a word of warning though . 
otterbox is the only thing i would put on my phones . 
i am a repeat buyer for these quality nordic ware pans . 
this whip will save my wrist ,  hand and fingers from arthritis fatigue . 
first of all the cooking area is big . 
i bought this to replace my old foreman grill . 
this is the second kitchenaid factory reconditioned appliance i have purchased . 
this is a very traditional wok strainer design with a modern twist . 
youll like this one ,  especially for the price !  . 
i really cannot find any fault with this item . 
i bought this purely because it was a wireless . 
i bought this product to pair with my blackberry num_extend
just goes to show that more expensive isn t always better !  . 
i was really pleasantly surprised at how sharp it is ,  too . 
the oil has a tendency to get  randy  . 
does a great job keeping the cutting boards in good shape . 
holds an extreme amount of peppercorns so you dont have to refill constantly . 
my mind is at ease using an oem product !  i m happy . 
i ve had it for a while and no complaints . 
i also use it to mix plain yogurt with stevia and flavorings . 
after multiple snags and bangs ,  the clip finally broke . 
it developed a small crack in the rim . 
if it ever breaks ,  i will immediately replace it . 
it s small enough that it store easily in the car . 
obviously you ll be much happier with your knives after some sharpening . 
so i bought this and it made my life easier . 
my wife has been on a kick lately making home made bread . 
very easy to use and like it very much . 
the coffee tastes great and the pot keeps the coffee hot . 
this pillow embraces you like a mother s arms . 
cable tidy under the toaster and an easy to remove crumb tray . 
the manual advises charging bigger devices like tablets with the num_extend port . 
if that changes ,  i will come back and update my review . 
it looks good and appears to be made of quality glass . 
it was a gift and was very well accepted and liked . 
i don t have the num_extend connection but do have a tape deck . 
this is a very heavy pot even without food in it . 
i did and it worked out really well . 
you want a good carpet shampooer without spending a fortune ,  get this . 
which is the reason you can t find it on any other retailer . 
i could not find this set in any store locally . 
i bought it because it seemed easier to use  it is  . 
i love how it looks ,  and how solid it feels . 
this should not happen with a bit of care . 
while in the store ,  i read your reviews and purchased . 
please consider the bottom pole actually screws into the base . 
makes phone awkward to hold and needs to be used hands free . 
with that said ,  i m not a veteran pro juicaholic . 
the shells of the hard cooked eggs just slip right off the egg . 
one side extension  to the switch  broke at about num_num months . 
i needed one for recycling as well so this is perfect . 
however ,  it is convenient and easy to clean . 
ok maybe this is exaggerating but i am impressed . 
i don t take care of the cast iron that much . 
this car charger has helped me out alot . 
this is normal ,  unless the bubbles have a speck in them . 
the paddles are a bit tricky to get off sometimes but nothing major . 
it s well made ,  and it does its job very well . 
perfect for a wedding or house warming present . 
this case is pretty slim yet protects the phone from the elements . 
it also helps me to ensure that everything s dry . 
easily put on and taken off of phone . 
another low cost smart phone on a pay as you go plan . 
it can be easily hand washed and returned to the grill after use . 
come home to find family members in my bed lol . 
there was a very slight sticking issue but nothing like i was expecting . 
seems to works and fit my blue tooth ear phone . 
but they are flexible and still fit perfectly . 
it does what i need it to do . 
use it literally every day making eggs for breakfast . 
i used this pan to bake my famous sweet potato pound cake . 
a classic for those who appreciate a good coffee . 
everyone at my house loved them and i will be ordering more soon . 
amazon is making my baking % fasterand better with the norpro ez pastryblender . 
i made a mistake and used the num_num variety which are slightly larger . 
it s versatile and i really like the pour spouts on the sides . 
nothing about my day would suggest i am a heavy phone user . 
just a lot of nice little thought went into this num_extend
my coffee is filtered better ,  and tastes great again . 
used in cabinets under bathroom sinks and provides neat and clean organization . 
i like it because it s one less thing to plug in . 
bought this for my husband for his samsung intensity ii phone . 
as it turned out this screw set was helpful . 
i carefully followed all instructions per the detailed email from ms . 
a lot thicker than the regular blow up beds . 
i was definitely worth the money  and it came really fast  . 
he must have gotten a lemon !  thinking of getting another . 
doing this once seems to work all morning . 
i would have rated it num_num stars if the table turned more easily . 
later on ,  i read reviews that mentioned this . 
i had no problem applying it and it fits perfectly on my iphone num_extend
his only comment was that this is only for a milkshake . 
i am very happy with this dispenser system . 
however ,  this is easily worked around with one of two num_extend
i think this will work fine for me however . 
i ve made white and wild mixed rice and both came out perfect . 
i kept entering the code as it requested ,  it kept rejecting it . 
i really like the handle ,  shape and weight of this knife . 
it is always good to have that spare one to save your day . 
i can hear him very well he says the sound is very clear . 
and even on the  low  speed i notice less dust in my room . 
the water apparently went directly into the cup without a drop spilled . 
food prep is a breeze when you have the right tool . 
i guess htc phones are notorious for this . 
the high end is fairly extended and not harsh . 
i did not need to flatten for the air bubble . 
no idea if it actually makes a difference !  . 
very minor flaw but probably no way around it . 
like i said ,  i use it all the time . 
hardly ,  if any ,  water sits at the bottom . 
it s a very nice addition to any fiestaware place setting . 
this is sturdy and makes coffee well like the glass ones . 
shipping was fast with prime ,  and the gloves look good . 
other then that ,  it s great and i would purchase again . 
the jabra freeway is the newest model since the cruiser num_extend
most cell phones have a very narrow circle to center over the ear . 
but having been able to do a direct comparison ,  wusthoff wins . 
i would buy it again and recommend it without hesitation . 
this is the best waffler you can buy . 
it can quarter poultry ,  separate beef or pork ribs with ease . 
i just needed another cable to charge my samsung captivate . 
the cordless kettle makes it convenient to pour and share with others . 
this technique is called hot wok ,  cold oil . 
they are not shiny ,  so they do not look cheap . 
i am very particular at this point about the skillet i use . 
it is small ,  light ,  affordable ,  and really does the job . 
this is a nice holder for a recipe ,  cookbook ,  etc . 
cleanup consists of a quick rinse in the sink . 
i only lost % during the num_extend that i was asleep . 
you won t be unhappy if you buy this rack . 
i ve had for some time now and really have no major complaints . 
they are beautiful and truly special to look at . 
this pepper mill is very easy to use and produces high volume quickly . 
does it make noise ,  yes .  .  . all air purifier will . 
for the price i am sure it cannot be beat . 
the dyson ,  you don t even have to think about it . 
i have a hisense sero num_num pro tablet and a nexus num_extend
it was so much heavier than i expected . 
i use this to make my homemade tomato sauce . 
so for me ,  this set was a good deal . 
the ambient background noise are instantly minimized when you are in a call . 
it s a little bulky ,  but does the job . 
i really like it and it works great !  . 
i have several of these chargers and love them . 
it works just on edge num_extend like the original iphone . 
i do not have an iphone ,  so i cannot comment on that . 
i can just glance at it and react accordingly . 
just make sure you get the size which matches your moka pot . 
i d say go ahead and pick one of these up . 
it s a silicone grease made for the job . 
i just bought this vacuum for my bare floors . 
place a wedge into each compartment and then press to fill the space . 
i purchased this along with other items so that we would have num_extend
the filters work well and were shipped quickly . 
this is the best and largest splatter screen i ve ever had . 
i have had this iced tea maker for about num_num yrs now . 
pound for pound it earns its num_num stars . 
it was very easy to use and to clean up afterward . 
for the price you cannont best this car charger !  . 
i was surprised at how well this knife performed . 
i use this a lot to cut homemade bread . 
the heavy duty plastic is nonbreakable ,  unlike glass . 
definitely a great buy if you want to get another charger !  . 
this is the spatula recommended by america s test kitchen . 
slides on and off the knives easily but stays in place well . 
i just u sed this dgshopper for the first time yesterday . 
the colors are very bright which is something i like . 
they have extra layers of plastic to allow the healing . 
the scale feels solid and extremely stable when standing on it . 
i gave num_num stars because it deserves them for the price . 
i have been using the voyager pro for about three months . 
i plan to get a second set to serve with non spicy broth . 
i would buy this again in a heartbeat . 
the spoon rest is large and works well . 
as for what i received ,  mine in excellent . 
after looking at them all ,  i chose the oster . 
i like the neck feature but rather have it in my pocket . 
last week i finally needed to use one and it worked great . 
love hoover with the two separate tanks and no flimsy bladder mess . 
the messages themselves are linked to the wrong sender . 
always choked on the stream of water as it was filling . 
some have complained about durrability ,  but they seem to be pretty rugged . 
this phone does every thing i could want from a phone . 
you can use it right away ,  right out of the box . 
i highly recommend these for a multitude of kitchen uses and craft projects . 
i was surprised by how well the touch strip works . 
the baguette crust comes out crisp and the inside is chewy and moist . 
this gave me a more even thickness on the meats i pounded . 
will be buying one for friends and family as well . 
i plugged in the charger and immediately ,  i heard nothing but static . 
in fact i have ordered num_num more sets . 
after num_num years it is still as good as new . 
i don t know if i m paying extra for that or what . 
the cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals . 
i do wish they had a pour spout for liquids . 
have had them for a few years ,  so far so good . 
all in all though ,  good for the price . 
a good deal on amazon for sure and came super quick . 
i anticipate getting plenty of use out of this pan . 
i love the clear sound and it never drops calls . 
i ordered because a cookie recipe i had suggested it . 
this is a needed product since ios num_num has come to life . 
there were a few bubbles but i got all but one out . 
it is so awesome !  veggies ,  meat ,  you name it . 
it is very stylish and does what is supposed to without any problems . 
and not to mention their price is really cheap !  . 
this num_num quart lc pitcher arrived in perfect condition and was packed expertly . 
so i thought i would give it a try and it s great . 
after a while i finally convinced my husband to give it a try . 
feels great in my hand and fits the phone very well . 
my husband wanted something to take with his lunch for work . 
i also like that it can be used with or without the earloop . 
the bigger knife is too big for cutting vegetables in my opinion . 
they just need to work ,  be strong and be durable . 
i was extra careful ordering and still got it wrong . 
one more note unrelated to the scoop itself . 
it acts like all clad cookware once you put it to the test . 
my second case got num_num big cracks on the ends . 
the price is good for a what is mostly a single piece design . 
for the price ,  they were a very good purchase . 
great for kitchens without much drawer space for larger kitchen utensils . 
material is quality and will hold up to years of use . 
great value for the money !  protects the case very well . 
i love that this had two usb charging ports . 
it is a bit tall but does fit beneath my cabinets . 
i m excited to serve these for my guests in the future . 
iphone keyboard is far worse ,  with absolutely horrid options for customization . 
i know can have thinly sliced onions and cucumbers that are paper thin . 
nicely protective and with a good texture for holding without being abrasive . 
this is my second one ,  good price too and easy to clean . 
this knife is great for slicing thick slabs of brisket . 
the protector also causes kind of a weird glare . 
we have single hung window that opens num_num inches wide . 
it is slightly smaller and not as sticky . 
many indian recipes call for roasting the spices in a teaspoon of oil . 
however ,  i popped the screen out ,  and this fan fits perfect . 
the bowls are also very easy to clean . 
the shape of the knife allows for easy rounded and spiral type cuts . 
because some places are charging a lot more plus shipping . 
the filters are paper but can we washed a couple of times . 
i am a huge fan of all htc phones . 
overall it s an essential device for your car . 
the product is not made in the u . s . a . 
no ,  its not an iphone num_extend but its pretty darn good . 
this productg is easy to use and cleans up nicely . 
i purchased one by jackery for that purpose and it works quite well . 
 i noticed another reviewer said they were unstable . 
they work well and fit perfectly in our bissell bagless vacuum cleaner . 
i give this product five stars because it was actually really cute . 
one for my santoku and one for my small chefs knife . 
this takes away that need . the crumb catcher works . 
they are a most useful addition for tablets for external flash drives . 
i will have to be on the phone for num_num hours a day . 
unscrew top and bottom ,  then remove bottom filter . 
think i may mount a couple in the kitchen for towels . 
would also help if the handholds were deeper . 
i listen to these things all day while at work . 
given the high ratings of this case ,  it didnt disappoint . 
it takes a little wiggling to get everything fitting smoothly . 
these are a great value and super cute . 
it seems to be a steel mesh thing . 
i would highly recommend it for the serious home cook for your kitchen . 
it didn t have that gummy residue like when boiling it . 
like them ,  but also purchased the big ones separately for taco salad . 
it s the perfect size and shape ,  fits in the fridge door . 
i have a unlocked sony ericsson num_extend and a atnt samsung num_extend
i saw it here at the cheap price and grabbed another one . 
i ve been using this thing daily for almost two years now . 
it s even in my directions ,  but i didn t believe it . 
i just really like this elegant design for everyday glassware . 
this product is perfect for my kindle fire . 
also ,  another color other than white would be nice . 
now we can make num_num lbs of jerky every week . 
the inside fits well and it is easy to clean . 
keep them sharp and never put in dishwasher . 
my husband told me we should try the yellow corn . 
cut around num_num num_num sims and tried them all . 
not as unobtrusive as earbuds ,  but very functional for the price . 
i ve upgraded my review from num_num stars to num_num stars . 
i got it on sale and am very happy with it . 
i tried another brand that a friend had and it was useless .

we have lots of fiesta ,  old and new . 
we also have nordic ware s combination stove top grill and pancake surface . 
i m buying two for my brother and my daughter . 
i run them through my dishwasher and they come out sparkling and shiny . 
i run this fan year round  even in winter  . 
these come in a variety of sizes and the lids have proper suction . 
when swiping your screen ,  the screen cover shifts a bit . 
it even has a useful list of commonly needed temperatures on it . 
works great and you can attach it to the extra long cheap cables . 
never thought i d be writing a review for a vegetable brush . 
ive dropped my phone num_num times and haven t seen any damage . 
using this on an older version iphone num_extend
true none the less ,  this waffle maker just works . 
i tried everything ,  then i emailed nokia for support . 
we were going to be away from civilization for num_num days . 
it charges the phone better than most verizon labeled ones . 
i searched for an exhaust fan for our new ,  hot garage . 
don t know why anyone would buy anything else for a motorola . 
the filter fits snugly and eliminates grounds in your cup . 
the otter silicone impact cover fits nicely on the iphone num_extend
tone is loud enough to hear without being obnoxious . 
otherwise ,  this mount is a little pricey ,  but % perfect . 
ditto for spaghetti sauce and whole links of italian sausage . 
we ve had this for at least num_num years and still works great . 
it was exactly what it appears to be . 
this week i had an unexpected visit from a friend . 
and you can wipe off the bottom with a rag . 
grind size is consistent ,  noise isn t too loud . 
large enough for several people ,  yet small enough for one person . 
tried another air popper but it broke after a few uses . 
i just rinsed it in hot water with minimal scrubbing . 
the large thermal carafe is worth the price of admission . 
the num_extend also had a lens cover and dual led . 
the pulp was dry and there was no clogging . 
i bought these to replace one i had gotten for free from someplace . 
product came on time and was well packaged . 
i liked them so much i ended up ordering more . 
it s been two years and the blade is still sharp . 
the igo chargers and tips are really great . 
reasonable price for this amount and they last forever . 
makes it harder to flip eggs and pancakes . worth it ?  yes . 
just what i needed to connect my cell phone to my computer . 
and always set it back to the normal or a default position . 
i am well pleased with it and really glad we bought it . 
we have a really modern kitchen and this goes perfectly . 
handle is substantial enough to handle a full pitcher with good control . 
this small folding screen gets the job done . 
i highly recommend this whisk for all cooks . 
don t let the price of the case discourage you from buying it . 
i never have to worry about not having enough cables now . 
bought the seeds ,  took them home and tried them . 
theres not much to say about a creamer . 
but the reality is this thing is awesome . 
i m very happy ,  especially for the low price . 
now to find one that fits the odd shaped smaller sink !  . 
this kit has all the essential tools to decorate cakes and cup cakes . 
it s really kinda fun to use !  well worth $
plus it has belt clip which doubles as a stand . 
i do not like glossy plastic and this thing is slathered in it . 
what can you really say ?  they re coffee filters . 
i was also struck by the lackof visible steam from the spigot . 
i noticed some reviews reporting some difficulty with this product . 
i have gotten every case i could for my iphone . 
i love my purchase and only regret not having purchased it sooner . 
if you are just starting out like us ,  try this bread maker .

i works as advertised and provides num_num mugs of seltzer before refilling . 
it s so convenient to have that extra bowl on hand . 
only num_num hours later the package had come num_num miles onto my doorstep . 
the color matches my drawers and cabinets perfectly . 
i had used one for years and unfortunately broke it .

some time i slice the veggies then chop them too . 
i know you are supposed to be exact when baking . 
i even noticed it while listening to music . 
i still had enough to charge my bluetooth headset . 
the phone provides great hd picture depending on your cell signal num_extend vs .

the only problem i have with it is lining the connectors . 
i have not had any problems at all with the finish . 
went in without a hitch and works great . 
i saw this product on several of those food network cooking shows . 
go to the store and buy it for yourself .

awesome awesome awesome buy works just as good as the expensive protectors . 
let me say that dinky secondary pop up dispenser is worthless . 
i shouldn t have thought about it for so long . 
i m very satisfied with my new  cookie scoop  . 
these can be pricey to buy at times . 
now i can eliminate the ancient wedging tool i was using . 
the concentrators can be used numerous times without changing . 
the cafe roma s little flaws annoy me sometimes ,  however . 
the num_extend had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers . 
it is far superior to any old plastic flatware holder . 
does what it is supposed to do ,  no complaints . 
it is all that is needed in my kitchen for mixing . 
recipient has used it and seems to like it . 
solid pot ,  reasonable thickness and perfect fitting lidvery pleased . 
while convenient ,  those happen to not be my most used apps . 
this also has excellent range even through several walls . 
this one is wide and barely fits my lifeproof nuud case for iphone num_extend
however ,  i knew that when i purchased it . 
we have the added benefit of the filter cleaning the air !  . 
i use them for everyday and bar drinks . 
i haven t tried using the sun as of yet . 
i am so in love with my new machine . 
haven t bought ice cream from the store since . 
i suspect that it would work well on any veg or fruit .

however ,  i have yet to find a suitable replacement . 
we ve cooked bread on it and it s came out wonderfully . 
i don t know why i didn t get one of these sooner .

everything else about the phone case is amazing though . 
but this is a delightful machine that i highly recommend . 
one company that still makes a fine ,  quality product . 
enjoy a wonderful cup of coffee ,  flavorful and not bitter . 
the cuisinart num_num slice toaster is a very good addition to my kitchen . 
the silicone ones all were thin and flimsy and just did not last . 
they are definitely aesthetically pleasing ,  for shower curtain rings !  . 
sizewize ,  it is a little bigger and thicker than an iphone . 
spots didn t hurt anything just like the shiny look vs spot . 
let me say ,  it is perfection in plastic . 
perfect fit for the num_extend and its buttons and connectors . 
you did what you said you would do . 
i love it  !  quick delivery too  !  . 
the blackberry charging adaptor pod is a high quality product and works fine . 
then marinade as you like and proceed as usual . 
i bought two because the charging part inside the phone is bad . 
once you start using french press you will never go back . 
we make hummus ,  peanut butter ,  sauces and more . 
before refilling it .   some pots do not actually shut down when empty . 
i loved the color if you can call a silver finish a color . 
it works as advertised and can easily be operated with just one hand . 
it takes longer to wash it than to chop and slice . 
no  itsy bitsy  cup available for grinding spices . 
some say its noisy ,  it s a small fan running hard . 
i have had an old egg poacher that was a pain to use . 
bowl also makes a good serviing bowl for other purposes . 
mine had a bad cable  which i didn t plan to use anyway  . 
temperature gauge is easy to read if placed near the num_extend
i ve been using these for the past year and a half . 
the recieving antenna will be in the wrong place . 
but they say it s washable !  well ,  technically speaking it is . 
proximity sensor appears to work fine . there are num_num num_extend
stands behind it s products ,  even out of warranty . 
the serrated edge stays nice and sharp and its easy to care for . 
many said that the special square melitta filters were not necessary . 
thanks for prompting me to place an order !  . 
but for the price i d paid i can t complain . 
i got this in the mail when i was too . 
one insert can be used many many times . 
a great product  ,  at a nice price . 
it shipped with some great seasoning and the shooter works well . 
i got mine at my local ace hardware for $
that s if the  pad  on the tip is going to last . 
let me first start off by reviewing this battery . 
this was refered to me by a family member . 
this roaster oven is a legend in performance . 
but the real speed is when you use hot tap water . 
it has seven num_extend home screens to customize . 
must have for preparing chicken or veal saltimbocca . 
bought this based on recommendations from america s test kitchen . 
it has a good battery life and is a durable headset . 
the no folding edge design makes cleaning easy . 
i purchased this for my mother who loves to cook  for everyone  . 
not a lot of bells and whistles on this . 
sprint ,  get with the program and ditch num_num cdma technology . 
this is hands down the best peeper i ve ever owned . 
this unit isn t as loud as some make it out to be . 
there are ones you can set automatically but a bit pricey for me . 
i initially blamed shopco for the bad heater . 
that is after using it nearly every day all that time . 
it does everything that we canted it to do . 
hardest part has been getting creative enough to fill the jar . 
purchased this to grate ginger and zest citrus . 
go for the name brand and you can trust the quality . 
like most reviewers pointed out make it difficult to near impossible to doc . 
it comes with the really long tip for filling the cupcakes etc . 
make a slit in the cut portion of the potato halves . 
i dropped this thing on concrete on many occasions and it kept going . 
we have used and destroyed a few of these in kitchen mistakes . 
how can you go wrong with a cover that is so expensive . 
what good is a measuring cup with no measurements . 
the cutting wheel and surrounding area is not rusty or gunked up either . 
went thru a lot of phones but one charger . 
there is a different christmas tree ,  but no animals at all . 
seems little tight on female end ,  but no big deal . 
i have to do all of that from the device . 
this device was made for people who are on the road a lot . 
will order more when my new granddaughter gets here . 
she loved the colors and its very durable . 
i wanted one of these for a while now . 
i m very happy with it and have no regrets about my purchase . 
i had another mandoline and when i saw this i decided to replace . 
the best tasting coffee one can make period . 
you cut them to whatever length you need . 
when i wear this one out ,  i will buy another one . 
overall i like it and haven t thought about replacing it . 
i do recommend it for anyone with a num_num cup cuisinart coffeemaker . 
one of my favorite cases that i have bought from amazon . 
my dil loved receiving this as part of her christmas gifts . 
don t be tempted to put them in the dish washer . 
it fits num_num quarts or you can double stack your pints . 
its combination of plastic and soft rubber is great . 
so easy to pick up the hot lids with this . 
my only reservation is that it s pretty short . 
great product and will be ordering a third color soon !  . 
i ve had plastic ones and they don t seem to last . 
i got it far my son he like it work well far him . 
you can use only one bud at a time . 
the discovery num_num so far is my favorite just above the blueant . 
this really does the job a lot better than a spatula . 
i used straight mineral oil prior to my buying this product . 
clean up is a breeze when you throw it in the dishwasher . 
straight up ,  this pan is heavy  check the prod . 
this is my num_extend eureka quick pick up cordless sweeper . 
i highly recommend this item as a gift !  . 
i really like the fact that you can use your headphones on them . 
leftover tea tastes good hours later or even the next day . 
i feel a new item should look new when it is received . 
i don t clean it very often; it doesn t need it . 
i m glad i discovered its limitations prior to the warranty running out . 
just what one needs to make a simple cup of loose leaf tea . 
when it finishes cooking it automatically goes into warming mode . 
i am getting all my pieces from this company !  . 
have used the pressure cooker several times already and it is great . 
i have discarded my iphone original earphone for this . 
these are small ,  good for small quantities of leftovers . 
i ve used it for everything from punch to chili without issue . 
not so if you push it down with your heel . 
bought the num_num qt pyrex separately ,  and the four nest together perfectly . 
it has become one of my favorite kitchen items overall . 
num_extend sounds clear crisp and good tonal range . 
and the fact that its purple is great . 
i came across the arctics while looking for a suitable replacement . 
the bottom is smooth with no pits or dimples . 
nice to have the smaller one and they store together very nicely . 
just hope it will not break after some uses like other brands . 
it does a great job of keeping a beer absolutely ice cold .

great thermos keeps my tea hot all day . 
i got these cases and am extremely impressed by their quality and durability . 
i am a much heavier user of bluetooth headsets than most . 
it seems to do a really good job for a cell phone camera . 
there are no buttons or switches of any type . 
i have arthritis in my hands so heavy cooking utensils are a problem . 
if you do ,  i think you probably won t have a problem . 
we love the deep dishes this set comes with . 
i m happy with both the blender and the food processor . 
and they are much nicer looking in the company of standard ss flatware . 
i have been using them for a while now and they protect great . 
cooks magazine did most of the work for me . 
the base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap . 
fits well and provides the seal as expected . 
i work from home ,  so this thing is awesome . 
it is simple enough my husband can use it . 
it is a nice thick solid wood  not plastic  with pivoting metal hanger . 
overall ,  i think it is good for the price .

my biggest con was the cleaning up of this pan . 
yesterday morning ,  i cored and sliced over num_num apples . 
i m an average cook and enjoy having decent tools around the kitchen . 
i purchased this machine after being unsatisfied with an num_extend de longhi . 
i use the larger bowl th most for big things like a cake . 
this case fits and provides good protection for the phone . 
just a few taps on the button is all it takes . 
i really hate cluttering my kitchen with sooo many gadgets . 
the case for what its worth is a good investment . 
unfortunately ,  this cannot be done with this particular headset . 
hopefully ,  i ll have these around for a while  :    . 
i m always looking for a way to make my gym experience better .

have had it and been using it regularly for num_num months . 
in the future ,  i will be using them to build desserts . 
the colorful cranes on a black background were an excellent choice . 
no problems so far and small size is ideal . 
plus it s almost large enough for a saturday night bath . 
this is the best bluetooth car set that i have ever used . 
i learned about other jars that had cheap ,  flimsy latches . 
it does go quick and wish it cost a little less . 
quality looks and construction on my blue one .

they re fun ,  easy to put and take off . 
this ladle fits in with the rest of the tools i picked up .

i initially decided to buy the num_extend liter model . 
i think this is such a beautiful ,  unique bowl . 
they seem to be drawn to it and have been having fun . 
unit seems fine but all but the quiet mode are way too loud . 
and num_extend do not knead the dough longer than num_num or num_num minutes . 
for the price it was worth it best ones yet . 
the qcell pretty much sucks but the anker has performed well . 
i often make coffee with a keurig on the num_extend setting . 
the lid is convenient when using it for wet ingredients that require pouring . 
i have tried different chargers and you name it i tried it . 
i hope the love affair lasts for awhile . 
i sure wish i would have purchased a board like this years ago . 
the cleaning head on this is fairly child safe . 
we will use a knife to make big slabs the right size .

we ve had this phone since march num_num  when it first came out  . 
it is slim ,  and not cheaply made for how much it is . 
we use gourmet type corn and it pops up large and fluffy . 
this slicer keeps going without a hiccup at all . 
she put it on the minute it came out of the packaging . 
this is probably the buy of num_num for me . 
even stronger than the burst of steam feature . 
easy to clean the pull out plastic insert . 
however ,  the more you have ,  the longer it takes . 
i have no regrets about adding this knife to my collection . 
love the case and the packaging is easy to get into . 
other pitchers are quite bulky and i only own a mini fridge . 
i have it and would recommend it to others . 
perfect fit for my num_extend in its uag case .

i bought this phone because it was less than $ unlocked . 
it s one solid piece ,  and does not fold .

knife is small ,  but i knew that going in . 
she did drop it couple of times but no damage . 
i keep all my knives in a special drawer just for knives . 
this is a keeper ,  and sets the standard for portable wireless speakers . 
i picked up the itorch as a  just in case  gadget . 
when you hear the clicking you know you have pumped enough times . 
i use it for calls in the car . 
this one is great ,  with the strainer that comes with it . 
hopefully ,  chemex will come up with a permanent filter soon .

i ve used it both hot and cold liquid . 
running on two aa batteries ,  you can easily carry spares around . 
i bought this for a gift for my husband who loves deer jerky . 
this shoe tree is perfect for my needs . 
other timers  like the ladybug timer sold on amazon  broke almost immediately . 
use this to swap winter coats and summer wear as the seasons change . 
it holds the phone tightly and fully perpendicular to the mount pad . 
has enough juice to charge my iphone num_num while it is playing music . 
next time ,  i will allow a longer cooking time than was recommended . 
the plunger is made of stainless steel ,  not cheap plastic . 
it was too high for me to reach to lay out my sweaters . 
just put my vibrant and snaps with holders around my phone . 
the phone itself is not one that i picked or researched extensively . 
even after months of use this thing is a really good buy . 
the set is really reasonably priced ,  but still well made . 
for around $ it was an easy decision . 
keeps wine fresh and is fun to use !  . 
this is the second one i ve owned though .

an ounces scale printed on the outside would have been nice though .

they are snug ,  but not exactly water tight . 
charges the devices at a great rate also . 
this replacement battery gives me as much battery power as the original . 
i bought this to organize odd bags of chips ,  etc . 
the center rivet probably will break eventually but replace it with a bolt . 
i would buy these again and recommend them . 
the old battery was going out ,  and this one fixed my issues .

i can t wait to try it out on some fish or chicken . 
i would definitely not try to do sweet potatoes in this . 
case fits perfectly and has all the cutouts in the right spots . 
when i first heard about a zester ,  i was intrigued . 
as another reviewer wrote :  kitchen aid got it right with this one . 
and this masher more than meets my expectations . 
my oven is extremely difficult to clean so this was a godesend . 
it is easy to clean and makes a nice ,  deep waffle . 
i love the colors and they were shipped to me very quickly . 
but overall ,  good material and a good case . 
i really just wanted a silicon case that would protect it from falls . 
it s worked well and has taken quite a beating . 
plus i wish i would have gotten it in the gray . 
the top makes for a perfect cup too . 
we ve only hand washed ours and it looks as good as new . 
my phone went crazy with the fully charged beep over and over . 
she says they work well and didn t cost a lot .

when you remove the old filter to put in a new .

you must remove the feed platform and remove the blade . 
you get a charger that does two duties for the price of one . 
i am just gonna say it up front . 
my daughters have an ipod each and they weren t protected . 
the smooth surface works great with a silicone spatula . 
not that the dog would care ,  i guess . 
it performs beautifully as a skillet ,  a wok ,  a casserole . 
i bought this machine as an upgrade from my breville cafe roma . 
it is beautiful on both sides as pictured . 
but ,  its moving parts are just too awkward . 
there was no mix up ,  and ohhh those fresh charge cycles . 
 i doubt it  i understand reviewers saying you have to press hard . 
used for hours on end in the car ,  works perfectly no problems . 
i love that i m not constantly wiping finger print marks away now . 
it pairs easily and connects easily after pairing . 
i put this screen between the two queen beds to add some privacy . 
cord is long enough to let phone rest in console . 
these scissors cut beautifully ,  and they don t wear out . 
it does correspods with the minute timer and it works . 
with this screen protector ,  it still feels like smooth glass . 
been through the dishwasher several times and still look like new . 
it s the perfect way to ensure separation and quick drying time . 
this sweeper is a good product and is a low price . 
if you love espresso then try this little maker . 
can not keep it inserted in meat while cooking . 
however ,  microwaving can make bread a little soggy . 
the charge has lasted for weeks on the average . 
i never did trust the pop ups on a turkey . 
so glad i bought this one !  it is worth every penny . 
i ve always had a cheap pan for frying sauteing and so on . 
they sit flat on the counter and detach easily from the ring . 
have even used to grate hard homemade soap to use in laundry . 
it stores easily and it looks great . great for cabin camping . 
at about two bucks a piece these can t be beat . 
my only issue with them is they like to stay curled . 
i use them mostly for baking supplies ,  flour ,  sugar ,  etc . 
better than what i bought at overstock for $
okay ,  not a million ,  but at least num_extend
it sync d with the cell phone ,  no problem . 
i started out with a wonderful electric coffee grinder by krups . 
this has exceeded my expectations on quality and durability and beauty . 
the bowl is the best too ,  rice almost never sticks to it . 
want to buy some for myself at some point . 
this pouch fits my iphone just fine in a very minimal way . 
the droids were nice ,  but they were heavy and clunky . 
it takes a bit of getting used to but what great coffee . 
i thought i d do a quick one year update . 
sorry i can not think of what normal brooms are made of . 
it fit perfect and snug the color looks great . 
she likes this one a lot and changes her cases often . 
frozen pizzas often suggest placing them directly on the oven rack . 
i am using only plastic spice containers with a narrowed neck .

the brushed aluminum one is even less expensive than it s red twin . 
there s no kneading paddle where it should be . 
every thing seem to be working like it should . 
most of the reviewers seemed to be pleased with their purchase . 
only really holds num_num burgers of a good size ,  will not hold num_extend
i try to purchase as many of my supplies from wilton ,  . 
no dullness that the  included  sharpening steel doesn t address . 
the mixer looks like a huge black blob sitting there . 
this phone is very responsive and has a crisp and clear screen . 
washing them by hand is not hugely inconvenient but i hate hand washing . 
hopefully the coating won t peel off in the near future . 
it heats up your food in minutes with nice convectional feature . 
for most of my small preparations ,  this meets my needs . 
this has all the features i wanted in a timer . 
they flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine . 
before i made this purchase i read all the reviews . 
we dump the stuff in and hit go . 
the thickness of the pan is a very big plus . 
the first negative aspect is the cheap design of the plunger . 
bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it . 
this i an average phone but a very good price . 
not recommended for those who want a private conversation in a crowd . 
i don t advise using the handles they get hot . 
will eventually become brittle ,  but it will take years . 
well ,  i had waffle goo everywhere imaginable and crumbled up waffles . 
it is easy to use ,  clean and keep handy on the counter . 
they were stainless steel ,  so i could avoid the breakage . 
i wish i had bought this as soon as i purchased my phone . 
if you buy another ,  you are wasting your money . 
i am now looking to buy the num_num qt . 
i would not let that keep me from buying such an outstanding mixer . 
i used my popper and it worked very well . 
you will find yourself using it for countless tasks . 
i ride with the phone attached to my handle bars . 
i had been looking for a good vegetable brush for a long time . 
using a good quality battery like the anker would have helped the sales . 
this is a nice case for the num_extend iphone . 
sound is good and battery life is sufficient . 
i experienced less lag using facetime or looking up stuff on safari . 
there are many options in sorting your digital photos . 
it fits perfectly over the grinder and other attachments . 
i like that i am able to control the temperature . 
it s black and shiny with a lid that swings around . 
a half cup is actually too many kernels . 
and you know with lodge you get great quality . 
but it does fit in the cd slot of the ford focus se num_extend
i bought this based on an america s test kitchen recommendation . 
it s neat being able to take a call as well . 
it has loads of room but you can also make it more compact . 
i use this tool so often and it works really well . 
cleaning the lid is a bit of a pain but i am lazy . 
i bought this because i needed a phone to work in israel . 
i researched every air purification system and decided to go with the healthmate . 
it came quickly and works like a charm . 
i have one set of these already ,  and wanted a second . 
i really liked them when i saw them . 
this is by far the best car charger i have ever owned . 
will buy other kitchen tools from this company for now on . 
the thicker size makes it easier to fit into the lid . 
the country white bread recipe on the normal bake cycle works perfectly . 
this box is absolutely perfect for what i intended . 
it mechanically functioned ok ,  so i put in the orville r . 
the product comes in a frustration free packaging . 
i even found a glass lid that fits it . 
sliced the guaze as easily as it sliced my thumb !  . 
my only complaint is the cord is very short . 
and for the price you can t do better in my opinion . 
this pasta ladle is excellent; it is well made and easy to clean . 
don t wait as long as i did for the convenience . 
included are photos demonstrating what i describe num_extend
i use these for spreading butter ,  mayo ,  peanut butter etc . 
verizon wanted triple that price for all three items . 
goes on smooth and thick and then slowly soaks in . 
you see a huge difference in air particles floating about . 
also wanted to avoid the cheap ikea type pressed wood style . 
it does the job of assisting in baking . 
they look more like little cups on that side . 
i have for years and years every friday made pizza . 
you can cut apart and place wherever on the inside of the cabinets . 
it s easy to use and i am very pleased with it . 
my first foray was making my very first batch of homemade fried chicken . 
i coordinate my phone cases with my outfits . 
it really gives it that extra little retro touch . 
makes perfect raw spaghetti from zuchini or squash . 
i enjoyed using them ,  and i hope this helps . 
now i don t have to worry about glare . 
i decided to try this one out since the price was right . 
it is made of quality glass and looks very pretty . 
now my pies turn out perfect and nicely brown . 
i want doubles so i ll be ordering another set right away . 
i don t understand the negative remarks about this ice cream mixer . 
circulon really is nonstick and the cleanup is a snap . 
this bread basket is a good size for our family of five . 
there are plenty of cases to customize to personal taste . 
we purchased these bowls to go with our other fiesta ware dishes . 
don t waste your money on any other brand . 
i went to order another one and the price has now almost doubled . 
here s how i do it; it couldn t be easier . 
i think maybe i didn t press it enough times . 
so really just depends on how you want to hang it . 
anyways ,  these matte protectors let your fingers slide over much more freely . 
the volume control and audio quality are adequate . 
i am glad i ignored them and purchased anyway . 
so i bought this boiled egg maker off of groupon last week . 
can t wait to use it full force at thanksgiving !  !  . 
he found his num_extend so i never really needed this . 
it looks really nice on the phone and offers fairly good protection . 
it makes all kinds of rice as well as steel cut oats . 
it has a great designed ,  easy to use ,  easy to clean . 
i loved it so much i bought num_num more as gifts . 
chose this life proof case to protect my iphone num_extend definitely did . 
i m debating replacing the one fan with the same unit . 
i use it to sit my coffee on . 
the build is solid and looks like quality material . 
our family loves these for fishing out pieces of crab and lobster meat . 
most smartphones want between num_extend and num_num amps for maximum charge rate . 
grab this for nothing else but to beat eggs in for recipes . 
if there is anything stuck ,  just soak for a little while . 
this is why all the tpu manufacturers use a molded volume rocker instead . 
anything more than a bare nudge will send the temp plummeting . 
it is incredibly heavy and feels very substantial . 
a great little protector case for your iphone . 
the blade rusted to the point it was too dull to use . 
does not seem to bother it at all . 
i bought this vac when my relatively expensive one died some months ago . 
my thanks to cooks illustrated for praising william bounds mills . 
it works really well ,  i have used it a lot . 
i will never attempt to clean another whisk . 
i have two popcorn cookers ,  this one and one for the microwave . 
not too bulky for a flight suit upper pocket . 
the machine is way too tall to fit under my cabinets . 
it s well worth the price ,  and will last a lifetime . 
the cord will separate rendering the cord useless . 
very durable ,  too !  i d totally buy these again . 
the instructions include cooking times for many popular foods . 
besides that ,  it s a very versatile and robust kitchen tool . 
the tablet had a % charge when i connected the num_extend
will update review if i have further problems . 
this is the fourth  or maybe the fifth  farberware pot we ve owned . 
for an inexpensive set ,  these are holding up great . 
looks nice and i feel my iphone is safe enough . 
also ,  this adapter makes a very secure connection . 
the touch screen is accurate and responsive ,  and very intuitive to use . 
updating my kitchen organization made this choice a  must do  . 
once you get use to how stainless cooks it is a nice pan . 
i really havent noticed any thing different in the cooking . 
these pasta bowls are the perfect size for pasta and a lot more . 
i ll definitely get more than my moneys worth from this brush . 
this griddle is heavy duty and just what i was looking for . 
we ve tried different potato types and even carrots . 
i purchased this item from another online retailer and bought it refurbished . 
this phone has some incredible features at this unlocked ,  off contract price . 
we mainly do oranges and grapefruit here in fl . 
this is a huge asset as these pizza stones are heavy and unwieldy . 
tried with usb thumb disk and worked very well . 
once you buy one product you will want them all . 
up to num_num phone numbers can be entered on the priority list . 
it leaves a bit larger piece behind when shredding or slicing . 
jury still out on that one . but it s all good . 
my previous orange juicer called the citrusmate was a disappointment . 
also works well for thin belts that i can t stick anywhere else . 
i phoned up motorola tech support and their rep . 
slips easily in and out of my pocket . 
sharp enough to cut without too much effort and consistently accurate cuts . 
it is nice and thick to provide lots of protection against scratches . 
it was a collection she and the whole household used daily . 
it s the best nonstick surface i ve ever used . 
a very small sum to invest in one s health . 
this is by far the best holder i ve ever had . 
it holds two credit cards in the back . 
they are easy to clean and bakes evenly . 
this one does the job and does it well . 
that s quite an accomplishment considering my poor eyesight . 
seriously ,  order it today and you won t regret it . 
i did take a couple of test shots with the camera . 
you won t have any regrets buying this one !  . 
arrived on time .  . love motorola phones ,  easy to use . 
they are of great quality and live up to the all clad name . 
i use these every morning in the gym . 
love this case ,  love the color ,  it protects my phone . 
very bright when needed and then shuts off . 
i personally love the case and get one for every phone i buy . 
about num_num or num_num minutes after you pour . 
but its wonderful and i completely am glad i bought it . 
wines stay good for two months ,  either in the refrigerator or pantry . 
fits perfectly and makes it easy to remember where you left your phone . 
they are the weak spot and can easily chip or break . 
a drop of water did not go inside . 
i followed the enclosed instructions  mostly  and had no problems . 
this product works well and is high quality . 
oxo generally makes good stuff and these are no exception . 
easy access to ports and buttons push easily . 
tongs are good for just about anything that s not sloppy or squishy . 
it was a good buy for use in my jeep . 
so this makes about num_num typical cups of coffee . 
i have an iphone num_extend with an incipio offgrid pro case . 
i prefer this to a brushed finish since it cleans up much easier . 
if wind is not an issue for you  ie . 
the water in the tank began to smell and taste like burning plastic . 
love this product and the ice cream it makes . 
this mixing bowl is a good size for most any task . 
since the door is flimsy plastic ,  it could cause it to break . 
i wash mine by hand usually ,  but probably not needed . 
until i ordered this and used it once . 
a great case and a great company !  highly recommended . 
i highly recommend this pricey but effective tool . 
this case is not for protection by any means . 
this morning it stayed off about num_num minutes . 
it s basically the same build quality as the iphone num_extend or iphone num_extend
in the interim i purchased a hand grinder . 
grounds right at the top of the filter and spilling out everywhere . 
i use this to hold my homemade laundry detergent . 
it produces a good even pure oil spray ,  and it saves money . 
the magnum num_extend peppercorn filler cap was redesigned . 
the price is wellworth it and is less expensive than other sites . 
if you want a finer grind ,  you simply leave it on longer . 
bento stainless steel lunch jaron my wishlist for three years . 
i used to be able to find these locally . 
has a girls look and feel to it . 
they can use it to cook almost anything in the microwave . 
pink tab has not slipped like in other reviews . 
excellent quality for the price of only $
my application came out with zero air bubbles . 
the espresso that comes out always tastes rich and not bitter . 
i decided to replace it with the henckels num_num star model . 
saves energy ,  cooks in a through manner and shuts off automatically . 
i received these for christmas from my daughter . 
tried it for the first time this morning . 
i love these little things ,  bought a few of them . 
it did not disappoint as it feels very nice in my hand . 
it doesn t ,  but it s only a few drips . 
they mailed me back a new pair in num_num days . 
basically anything about an inch thick should cook ok . 
simply ,  mix the dry ingredients in the machine before adding the wet . 
i don t really like the sound of bluetooth received music . 
i guess some people just can t get anything right . 
it is ideal for washing and draining celery . 
i highly recommend this dutch oven if you re looking for one !  . 
will buy more as this is a great gift idea . 
my other broke so this is a great replacement . 
it works as good as my last one . 
it s very difficult to install perfectly with no air bubbles ,  etc . 
the unit came charged and ready to go . 
i did not want one of the cheap yellow and green plastic ones . 
they are great to hold and grab for everyday family use . 
i use it with an iphone num_extend while working out . 
getting a good deal is part of the joy of life . 
it s very sharp and goes right through the apple with any issues . 
just buy a coupler and some tips and you ll be all set . 
i emptied it and quite a bit of fur came out . 
other than that ,  this is a great product !  . 
one of our carpets is solid dark brown and this cleans it well . 
perfect for placing thin layers of cake upon a previously iced layer . 
i am very happy with the overall experience . 
i glued as well as screwed the acrylic guide to the wood . 
the battery charge just doesn t last long enough . 
i don t find these  cups  tippy at all . 
and you do you want them off its easy . 
a couple of spots were easily cleaned with a damp towel . 
they of course have come in handy for mixing things and storing things . 
this tabletop fan is powerful enough to use on the floor . 
it is relatively well made ,  and is quite sturdy . 
love it and glad you still keep these in stock . 
i like to have good knives to make everything easier when i cook . 
we use this heater to supplement the gas heat in our home . 
amazon has a great price ,  but availability is a problem . 
my last try was a famous name deep fat fryer purchased at amazon . 
you do not have to wait to season ,  just start using . 
i just clip it in a sunglasses holder that is on my visor . 
you cannot go wrong with this purchase  useful in any kitchen  . 
small ,  low profile ,  seems able to get under just about num_extend
i especially like the opening in the back for the apple logo . 
take my word ,  if you want quality over quantity buy these !  . 
the lodge skillet is the gold standard in modern cast iron skillets . 
this stores and cleans much much easier than a conventional whisk . 
it s easy to clean and easy to hold . 
i purchased this one because of the reviews . 
water all flows into the sink and it s really clean . 
i ve had these for two years and they are still working fine . 
this is a great deal for an oem battery . 
these are very handy for both soup and coffee . 
first ,  the bread maker arrived quickly and well packaged . 
not to much of a big deal ,  just clean it off . 
the little bissel seemed to be a reasonable compromise . 
i love the protection that the cover give to my daughters cellphone . 
the pan is num_num inch in diameter and num_extend inch tall . 
from the pictures and the reviews ,  it looked very num_extend
i no longer have to leave it plugged on all night . 
also ,  the colour does not match the picture . 
i recently bought a bread machine ,  and just purchased this knife . 
some users out there report that the handle melts . 
it is almost like a sea foam green . 
they come out the perfect color and consistency every time . 
the motor slowly ramping up is a nice feature . 
all the meat surface is in contact with the pan at once . 
the slicer did cut the onion just fine ,  and quickly . 
good sound and well designed for a reasonable price . 
run this app and you will never have that problem again . 
i read the reviews before buying and decided to go for it . 
now i can pop the bowl off with one hand . 
it is a blend of hard and plastic and soft rubber . 
i ve had an iphone since the first version was introduced in num_extend
so i figured i would buy a new pot and switch to stainless . 
the quality and comfort has exceeded my expectations . 
it walked off the counter and fell onto the floor . 
resumed the project as soon as the juicer arrived . 
the feel of the case is also very nice . 
as someone who hates saran  plastic  wrap ,  this is ideal . 
works great ,  precise temperatures ,  and best of all ,  no teflon . 
so i bought some more i like this so much  :   . 
apple has been doing that since first version . 
i also have her wok lid or wok hat as i call it . 
the cakes bake perfectly and easily pop out when done . 
this became an issue as carpel tunnel syndrome made my hands into hooks . 
google maps is also included and is highly functional on this unit . 
this oven thermometer is large enough to read and accurate . 
i agree with others that this is a fine piece of equipment . 
ditto my remarks re :  num_num inch wilton spatula . 
i bit thicker and taller than the cheapest coffee filters . 
this timer does every thing i need to know . 
better than the original one ,  but not a lot . 
and the cord is a little on the short side . 
like everything oxo makes ,  these are great spoons . 
somehow i lucked out and picked this up on amazon for $
so far this stone is working out well for me . 
that translate in num_num star offi will keep it . 
but i prefer to carry as little as possible . 
the ice crushers don t liquefy the clam pieces . 
i used the same screen protector for num_num years . 
a heck of a lot better than peeling by hand . 
i will never buy a rice cooker other than zojiushi !  . 
uses more grinds than average peculator or drip models . 
this is surely the best of what is available . 
it is the smallest and simplest but it just works . 
the set i use is about num_num years old and good as new . 
i would highly recommend it because the contour cradles the shoulder perfectly . 
somehow we lost the seal to our blender . 
just what i needed for all my baking needs . 
i bought these and could not be happier . 
a little polish keeps it bright and shiny . 
finally ,  i decided to give this one a try . 
in theory it is perfect for what it is designed for . 
any pileup in the bathroom and the register gets covered up . 
previously ,  i had the equivalent model for my motorola android . 
on long flights ,  i ve seen my battery drop down significantly . 
i had bought mine through verizon with a % corp . 
i only use the larger cutter size with long potatoes . 
the commandone accomplishes the same task without the physical contact . 
i have had many espressos but this machine by far outclasses the others . 
and metal fans do work better than plastic ones ,  in my opinion . 
some throw chunks of veggies out the feed shoot . 
almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras . 
i knew it didn t when i bought the set . 
the next day i used it again and got much more . 
the rice bowl cleans up with no effort ,  nothing sticks . 
also ,  it is easy to use and creates you fabulous photos . 
if you try and pound the plastic in ,  it bends and deforms . 
typically the long cords make charging a device take longer . 
the num_extend was last charged about num_num weeks ago . 
this is a beautiful piece that sits on the counter . 
i dont recommend putting this in the dish washer  even if you could . 
this oxo peeler is smooth as silk with the peels long and even . 
this is perfect for syrup or other sauces . 
hope the element in the bottom lasts a while . 
and you get so many for a good price . 
the food processor attachment is amazingly better than by old braun unit . 
this will give your phone a full charge . 
so we returned it and got another one . 
we also need to prevent them from soaking up excessive water . 
if you need a portable battery ,  this is the one to buy . 
its big screen makes it really a computer in your pocket . 
take it out of the oven and enjoy . 
the batter seems to work best if a bit runny . 
wonderful set of attachments that have come in so handy . 
his presentation ,  and creativity far surpassed my ability . 
uggh !  this frieling model is entirely stainless steel . 
it s an excellent wine opener ,  and it is easy to use . 
this thing is smaller than i thought it would be by the pictures . 
finally i found a turner that does the job . 
yes ,  they are plastic ,  but completely capable of doing their job . 
i have to remove my hard shell case but i expected that . 
the second set of corded works still ,  but no pause . 
i ve been using this for years and it always works well . 
when this one stops working i ll buy another . 
this one looks great and it is a substantial piece for the price . 
the rubber stoppers are very simple and are not likely to break . 
don t hear all the background noise like with the other ones . 
bought for my little brother ,  he loves it . 
since it s a usb device ,  it charges from a computer . 
have had the motorola atrix num_extend for num_num months now . 
can charge the battery from % to % at least two times . 
at this price ,  there is no reason not to . 
this product is very appealing looking and practical at the same time . 
i give this as a gift all the time to newlyweds . 
it holds heat quite well if covered with plastic wrap . 
just need to be careful setting lid on granite counters . 
this is beacuse the iron is rough and only through use become smooth . 
it is definitely one of the most durable cases i have owned . 
i tried the trick with the pinch of salt . 
and the precision of the fit and finish is a joy to behold . 
i can t ask for any more than that . 
say  hang up  and the phone hangs up . 
it s easy to sit and eat in front of a tv too . 
it works better than i thought it would when i first saw it . 
my family is not large so small mixes work for me . 
the build is quality and a decent strainer . 
these screens have protected my kids galaxy tabs soooo good . 
as someone who travels frequently i like to pack asfew chargers as possible . 
i wanted an inexpensive headset to use for skype phone calls . 
they should include a small brush to clean after each grind . 
it was the cheapest grinder available through amazon . 
made short work of many lemons that ripened all at once . 
you can pull the usb plug out of the hole in the dock . 
i bought this to serve as a rice and risotto cooker . 
it s a little slow getting warmed up ,  but quite durable . 
these tumblers have been a staple of our glassware collection for years . 
the skillet came ready to use and well seasoned . 
i especially liked the selection of the most used sizes with this set . 
the unit i received looks brand new and works great . 
it is beautiful ,  but better yet .  .  . it is functional . 
cool blue lamp which indicates charger is well connected in power num_extend
i am so pleased with this lid rack . 
of course when it arrived it also has a plastic top . 
highly num_extend month update : i am really appreciating this phone . 
the handle has a good feel and the cover is a bonus . 
thus ,  this is easily the best case available for the nexus s . 
i wasn t satisfied with other hand juicers that i have used . 
i saw this same ifrogz case for num_extend at bestbuy . 
garlic is delicious and your hands should smell if you are cooking . 
i m sure i ll find some use for it . 
we have made several batches of ice cream and have had much success . 
 dishwasher safe  we like these so much plan on buying two more sets . 
very sturdy . recommended to anyone that needs a strap . 
i can t find anything negative about this battery . 
gotta have one if you use a dutch oven while camping . 
this is really a better product than i expected . 
seems a mite rugged to be made out of num_extend
these screen protectors fit really well ,  cut exactly to fit the torch . 
will be buying a few more of these in different sizes !  . 
these are the best cables for that quick audio connection in newer autos . 
it s awkward because you want to get the bags above the plunger . 
i don t understand many of the complaints in these reviews . 
the windscreen is great too for the microphone . 
moreover ,  the order was delivered within num_num hours ,  unbelievable . 
i am able to clean it in the dishwasher . 
this has to be the best mixer i have ever owned . 
i m lucky to get num_extend with moderate use from my original battery . 
this battery works just like the stock one that came with my bionic . 
i was aprehensive at first in buying a case like this . 
using it with the mason jars also makes storage simple and neat . 
i have been cooking pasta in it since i got it . 
i connect three iphones for my family and a mini usb . 
i bought this for my boyfriend ,  who loves grilled meat . 
in which case i m sure navigation will be a godsend . 
it was a brilliant idea to make a pitcher with a mixer . 
works with my rezound extended batteries and lightweight . 
needed an upgrade but didnt have an upgrade available with sprint yet . 
i bought two of these and love them . 
it replaced my starbucks grinder ,  which had a much smaller capacity . 
and so it remains with my num_extend mundial . 
the mixer is rather heavy to lift and move around otherwise . 
we purchased this to work with our humidifier . 
this little dish makes excellent steamed corn in little time . 
however ,  i do like everything else about the headset . 
the scythe makes a once miserable job easy . 
next ,  we tried the command strips again on some painted drywall . 
need to find a good book of steaming recipes and that s it . 
like the versatility of using it as a punch bowl . 
rutland + free shipping and there was my favorite thermometer . 
for the $ i paid theres nothing not to like . 
i m thinking of buying a re one just for the style . 
i also use them for making lemon and lime pies . 
easy to install and very easy to remove the phone from the clip . 
i have zero hesitation in recommending this headset to you . 
this is a perfect little tool for small batches . 
skins can be had on ebay for about $ bucks . 
wish there was a similar product for other phones !  . 
i got this waffle maker from my daughter for christmas . 
i got this juicer after reading glowing reviews and i agree . 
i have had num_num of these for about num_num years . 
however ,  with a slow cooker it s really hard to go wrong . 
i have one for my kindle fire and i love it . 
i saw everything on youtube except that one . 
i safe so much money during college by using this product . 
the press is as heavy as it is heavy duty . 
this is so much better than others on the market !  . 
i do not find it too short at all . 
it makes using a touchscreen so much easier . 
once again ,  you get what you pay for . 
it looks very sturdy and was a good buy . 
line of site range is pretty good ,  but practically irrelevant . 
i was pleasantly surprised when i received this kitchenaid ladle . 
it was good didn t know that it would get furry that fast . 
i used to buy cheap $ can openers at the dollar store . 
all four attach to a sturdy plastic ring . 
works fine ,  it charges my phone like its supposed to . 
i love that it doesn t leave finger prints . 
i made a batch of cookies and it mixed up fine . 
if you have average sized hands  guys  it should be fine for you . 
i am very impressed with the quality and design . 
products work exactly as described ,  no issues ,  arrived before promised . 
ah well ,  you do indeed get what you pay for . 
i finally caved and purchased this because i kept dropping my iphone . 
i love bacon ,  but hate that it takes forever to cook . 
i ve never basted a turkey in my life . 
used it for a few weeks now and it works just fine . 
cant say enough good things about these inexpensive phone cases from amazon . 
audio prompts make it easy to set up . 
i use this almost exclusively to cut my pies . 
the red and the pink are hard to tell apart . 
then she figured out she was pressing it the reverse way . 
i ll never buy another electric can opener again !  . 
it fits the phone perfectly and does provide a decent amount of protection . 
it was a bit of hassle but livable . 
this little movement was not very noticable or bothersome . 
survived a car accident that i almost didnt . 
the cable material itself feels much better than the generic brand i bought . 
this farberware pan is more of a regular sized type loaf of bread . 
it s like it s num_num again at my desk . 
this is not like getting a microwave breakfast to save time . 
the fiesta ware bowl is great and the color was vibrant . 
i knocked of a star for two reasons . 
still making the best cakes and cookies ever . 
we have used it quite a bit to slice deli meats and cheeses . 
i like this so much better than the small balloon whisks . 
i could be a little more heavier on the bottom though . 
i m buying another set before they stop making them . 
what a bargain !  i used it twice so far . 
this is easily the best coffee maker i ve ever owned . 
i regularly use a santoku knife for my main prep . 
and of course the smallest bowl is my favorite . 
by far the best headset i have ever used . 
love that you can answer phone calls with it . 
turned upside down on a drying rack ,  it dries very well . 
wish i had found this one long ago . 
they offer a lifetime warranty  you pay shipping  . 
meaning ,  fragile items do not have their own marked bag . 
but i need more so i can have extras to switch them around . 
quickly loosens the  skin  off garlic cloves making it a breeze to remove . 
flameproof ,  and funnels the pellets right where i need them . 
i found this replacement on amazon which fixed the leaking problem . 
this thing handles them all like a pro . 
we really like that about them . they are excellent . 
getting it on correct is important ,  but not too difficult . 
however ,  i did learn one super cool trick . 
the shipping was prompt and the packaging was sufficient . 
i went with this one because it was insulated . 
will be making an italian cream wedding cake and needed an additional pan . 
the popper works great with or without oil . 
very good ,  rapid charge great price would recommend it to a freind . 
i needed a pot that would work on my induction counter top . 
great case ,  fit is perfect ,  protection is great . 
oxo is fond of rubberized grips ,  which do make for comfortable usage . 
this dustbuster has plenty of power and works great . 
i know nordic makes the best pans and i have several . 
little extras can be placed in the side pocket . 
when closed ,  this thing can hide behind a num_extend cent piece . 
i would have used such an item when i first started w . 
easy to clean and easy to lock up to get your meal started . 
i place them back in my wine fridge with no worries of spillage . 
my iphone has dropped numerous times and has been fully protected  !  . 
what isnt to love about these fun baskets . 
this sango canister set is the typical four piece grouping . 
the keyboard is ok ,  but   .   should have a dedicated key . 
they are quite comfortable and have an excellent balance . 
this adapter worked well for turtle beaches num_extend and num_extend
sturdier and longer that oem ,  i will order extras . 
so ,  i decided to look for a stovetop . 
the phone case protected my phone very well . 
the first set we bought over num_num years ago . 
other than that i would not hesitate to order again from this seller . 
in fact wondered why i don t make cookies all year long ?  . 
it weighs maybe num_num pounds ,  and is solid metal through and through . 
perfect slim close fitting case and is well worth the money . 
very happy with these cases on our iphone num_extend
the sound quality is decent ,  not pro quality ,  but good . 
i will be purchasing the sealer for regular jars as well . 
really helps in determining thermostat setting for furnace . 
overall it s an excellent waffle baker and highly recommend it !  . 
this is a great french press  with a few issues  . 
it sticks well to my stainless steel sink . 
i just love my new braun water kettle . 
this delightful gadget has changed my pizza buying habits . 
highly recommended ,  and a great value for the price . 
the cheese slicer can also be used for olives and hard boiled eggs . 
the dark color makes the crust turn out perfect . 
i have not wanted nor needed to buy a case since . 
think the box was torn and that is why amazon marked it down . 
so this is deffinately the pan you want . 
if you re expanding your collection ,  this is a great option . 
it was very easy to pair with my phone . 
we also use the product as a slow cooker quite often . 
i can definitely charge both my ipad and ipod at the same time . 
wish i could give it a num_extend but i can t . 
it makes a slight spout which is great for scooping . 
i use it at least once per day to charge my phone . 
there are ridges for the caps ,  but are not with the product . 
mow the lawn ?  put these on and head set over them . 
love the ease of taking up extra cord with the side velcro tab . 
i tried to take it out of the vent . 
i have used every blade and every disc that came with the set . 
this is basically a num_num for num_num deal . 
i just bought this cooker and have only used it twice . 
the handle is nice and long so it makes it safe to use . 
only need to bring one charger on trips . 
i have the seidio battery that they sell in official sprint stores . 
this was a great case for my lg when i owned it . 
the sizes seem pretty convenient  ,  and they came quickly . 
this is dependent on the nature of the recipe you re baking . 
this bluetooth headset works better than any i ve had . 
this is the perfect travel companion for keeping your blackberry charged . 
very nice quality as most oxo products are . 
best juicer i have ever used ,  including higher end electrics . 
all i know is that i love this can opener . 
i was hesitant to purchase this but my scrooginess prevailed . 
i like to use a mouse so the usb adaptor is very handy . 
so i did and i don t regret buying this product . 
but that s my fault !  i ll buy a smaller one soon . 
i love it !  very accurate setting that respond quickly to setting changes . 
it seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean . 
you ll want to wait until after the meat rests . 
the tines are nice and sharp ,  and a good length . 
everything is as it should be so far . 
i switched from the name brand gps and sold it . 
good balance of rubber and plastic ,  i thoroughly enjoy this phone case . 
i m a big fan ,  my sweetheart not so much . 
i bought only one kitchenart num_num gourmet buttermate . 
along with the heavy cord my phone charges up in no time . 
you wonder if there s anyone in charge of the shipping department . 
here is what i found upon receiving it . 
delivered it quickly  helps to have amazon prime  and assembled easily . 
this slow cooker cooks well ,  just as the other reviewers have stated . 
seem to be a good product i would recommend . 
i live in a small apartment with a galley kitchen . 
keeps phone from cracking and braking when dropped . 
measure num_num inches with your fingers and they actually are that size . 
i had already came up with a design to modify the unit . 
i have been using these daily for about a year now . 
i think my love for this popper is all relative to price . 
these are great for the glove compartment of the car . 
the card need not have any $ on it . 
this gap is very noticeable around the volume buttons and slider switch . 
i m glad i purchased this item on amazon . com . 
they immediatelyemailed me a ups shipping label and directions . 
guess it s good exercise for my right arm !  . 
it s not gaudy ,  i just don t like it . 
this is a handy gadget for the kitchen . 
when i vacuum my husband leaves the house . 
i called their customer service ,  and they offered a replacement immediately . 
rather than that ,  it is perfect and highly recommended . 
it was shipped quickley and was exactly as described . 
definitely noticed an improvement after i used this . 
but i ve already bought a second one to give to my daughter . 
a super product for one or two people . 
i have very few complaints as well about this battery . 
easy to install and looks great after several weeks of abuse . 
i bought this yogurt maker after reading many reviews . 
the first pair was replaced twice through the warranty . 
the pressure value is not something i have to worry about . 
however ,  the metal ring is a different story . 
made by the people who make the renowned swiss army knives . 
maybe a drop of honey will mix with the water at the bottom . 
i also wish that you could buy seperate pots . 
battery life is great and it s super lightweight . 
the second call i made was through my mac using skype . 
the light on my phone is not even close to being covered up . 
i had no problems with the installation or use of the software . 
i got this for my husband ,  heloves it . 
i can only attribute this to the stone . 
it s been through the ringer in my truck and still works wonderfully . 
easy to open ,  but it doesn t pop open on its own . 
cook s illustrated is certainly  on the money  with this knife . 
these screen protectors are th best i ve ever put on my iphone . 
i have bought num_num of these so far . 
fortunately ,  many  most ?   modern phones support multiple connections . 
today the plastic part of my francis num_extend machine got loose and leaky . 
i have used many different screen protectors for my electronic devices . 
it s easy to put on a rod and easy to use . 
not really a big con ,  but something to note . 
you may not even realize it simply needs a new battery . 
the small details can make a huge difference . 
sometimes you have to really loosen the outer part before tightening . 
doesn t bother me as much as plugging in twice a day though . 
also ,  the battery life is okay but not great . 
this was purchased as a gift and has been well received . 
just right for a couple or single person to use in their kitchen . 
it allows my droid phone to sit well in the dash mount . 
not great in a loud situation ,  but perfect for at home . 
it beeps when ready so you do not forget to flip it . 
i got them for my iphone num_extend model . 
i was looking for one for my brother . 
the jar is nice and heavy ,  and comes with a rubber gasket . 
all i can say is i am absolutely thrilled with it . 
the beep is loud enough to hear ,  without being annoying . 
i like that; i prefer lattes over cappuccinos . 
they do not stay to long on the phones . 
they are easy to install and i would recommend them . 
this stand mixer is great for making breads . 
but anything negative about this toaster would be very minor in comparison . 
i will update this review if i run into any issue . 
 other brands don t know how she was breaking them but they broke . 
well worth a few extra dollars over standard irons . 
it puts moisture into the air at a low cost . 
which can be good or bad depending on your taste . 
this is a fairly functional measuring cup if i do say so myself . 
it s not hard to use the pins at all . 
good solid thick bottoms and quality all the way around . 
you can then pour it into another container if you want to . 
yes it can leak all over the counter . 
it charges anything i wanted in my car . 
my two dogs and husband track it in . 
the case was a better cover that the one supplied by blackberry . 
they are a quality product and i love the design on this . 
this all sounds a lot more comlicated than it is . 
heavy vegetable oils may leave residue that can affect nonstick performance . 
our last batch literally had every kernel pop and did not burn . 
enough left over for other random projects too . 
but i m going to cross that bridge when i come to it . 
i followed the directions and made great cheese on the first try . 
i didn t found any issue with this product . 
takes about num_num minutes num_num seconds in my very old kenmore microwave . 
there was a pink ,  purple ,  white ,  and black . 
if the cord was long ,  it would get num_num stars . 
i ve used them with my droid x and my droid dna . 
turn the handle back and the screw glides out of the cork . 
fill all the expectations and i share it with others . 
the device says in the directions not to try oily seeds or grain . 
with proper care ,  it s made to last for decades . 
it does come with a decent screen protector . 
just a steady strong stream of wonderful air . 
what a fantastic wedding gift this would make . 
i thought i would surprise her with these . 
first ,  there are direct access number pads for inputting the time . 
it s great to get the hotter temperatures for stir frying . 
they r a good price and it works a win win situation . 
this is a tool line that has no equal . 
each shelf supported much more weight than i would have expected . 
plus i can put it in the dishwasher . 
can connect to both my ipad and iphone with no problem . 
great product works great and get the job done . 
and there is a knack to sealing the lid . 
i get plenty of life out of the palm cover . 
i also use it to remove poached eggs from the pot . 
my husband bought this for his cell phone . 
there are many reviewers here who complained of coffee leaking out during brewing . 
my only complaint is that they are not hand friendly . 
this is a great product for small families . 
it s quite ,  easy to clean and does the job . 
it s not so bulky and fits well to hand . 
i like this pan so much that i ordered a second pan . 
it does everything i was hoping it would . 
another option is to gring with the lower lid off . 
it s attractive and makes a great addition to my cappuccino machine . 
i am very happy with this speaker phone . 
it works great . now ,  for another glass of that grapefruit juice . 
in my opinion this was a good choice . 
i brought it back and got a replacement . 
they never break or collapse under normal use . 
like the ginsu knives that used to be on tv . 
 i have a dog and lots of hair gets on the floor  . 
very nice funnel for use in small opening bottles . 
we are only seeing the tip of num_extend
i ve bought multiple of these in the past few years . 
i like that it isn t too bulky and the cutouts are perfect . 
i love the way it looks but yet it s cheap . 
growing up ,  my parents had a compost bucket in the kitchen . 
that said ,  i give num_extend stars to the eureka  maxima  . 
as a pen ,  it writes nice and smooth ,  with no skipping . 
it s easy to use and the paddle and pan are stout . 
never had a problem with an amco squeezer . 
i don t ever use cash ,  so this suits me perfectly . 
i would never get a different case than this for an iphone num_extend
nice hard case ,  fits well on iphone num_extend
it works well and charges it fairly quickly . 
yes ,  this would be for the serious ice cream scooper . 
i also use this tool to cut through other flat food items . 
the lost star is for the lack of adjustment for a comfortable fit . 
the krups has been the best out of the bunch . 
it is easy to grab on to and find now . 
i find the phone comfortable to wear and easy to use . 
i practiced with no filling as was suggested by someone . 
easy to clean up and no glass to break . 
you can also purchase the canned sprays that contain flour . 
it is the best !  i can hardy wait to try other meats . 
an order form is enclosed with this grinder . 
use theme every christmas to hang things on the windows . 
the different colors make it easy to use them for different foods . 
great fit plover it wow just what i order every tithing . 
i ve had this coffee maker for about num_num years now . 
this may be my fault and her advice may work for others . 
i have dropped this one in the otterbox and no problems . 
allow it to cool down and wipe excess oil off . 
it just works and charges your xoom in no time . 
this one is very large and holds a ton of stuff . 
tonight we had a pizzaria uno deep dish . 
i like the shun knives for how well they work . 
bought this car charger for the blackberry bold num_extend
filters a full pitcher in about num_num minutes . 
then a family member recommended the culligan faucet mounted unit . 
 although i m not sure what the little stickies are for . 
when you move this much air ,  it makes noise . 
went home and cleaned her out and seasoned the pot . 
if you hold the button continuously the floor will get wet . 
didn t want my daughter to scratch her screen . 
it looks just like it s pictured on the product page . 
i love cuisinart products and decided to purchase this one . 
oxo has a winner with these . small and convenient . 
between the two ,  this is a highly recommended purchase . 
what i wanted was something i could reuse . 
cups are different material and i don t like it . 
i may order more at a later date ,  smaller . 
this is one of my favorite kitchen electronics . 
hope the num_num cents helps !  happy amazon shopping . 
next i will make a fruit flavored frozen yogurt . 
keeps butter for fresh and easy to use for days . 
this is  the  device that many people have been waiting for . 
nice to have option of casserole type thing or souffle . 
easy to open package and very little assembly is required . 
i use num_num sheets at a time when making num_num doz cookies . 
the num_num inch fit my chicago metallic cake pans perfectly . 
for the job of making coffee ,  this is the right tool . 
i have it in grey ,  pink and purple . 
i love them all ,  they are superior cooking vessels . 
i use this item every day for music ,  podcasts ,  and audiobooks . 
and here are no deals on these anywhere . 
purchased this to go along with the black and crimson jewell premium popcorn . 
for the few dollars this cover cost ,  it was a great purchase . 
this is my first attempt at bling .  . i love it . 
i use them all the time for all kinds of cooking and baking . 
the amount of things you can do with this is just amazing . 
the price is reasonable enough for me to get several at a time . 
i cook both short and long grain brown rice in this manner . 
using mixer ,  add in softened butter until thoroughly distributed . 
made in france . i hope this was helpful to you . 
do you like coffee ?  if so ,  then this is your coffeemaker . 
it worked for three years with no failures until i upgraded the phone . 
this case is well liked by my son who has dropped many phones . 
makes perfectly shaped loaves ,  just like your local bakery . 
this problem got worse with the addition of the extended battery . 
i don t think you can go wrong either way !  . 
i have always only bought samsung phones because of the reliability . 
after opening and closing quite a few times it gives a little . 
she was told her phone was beyond repair . 
and the moshi moshi is deep inside the house . 
especially when you use the phone for a while and it heats up . 
which is why i bought the soda siphon . 
num_num stars for another great lifesaving new trent product . 
charger is perfect and just what i ordered . 
slightly rough texture is perfect ,  very pleasant to hold . 
the only damage done was two dots imprinted on the case . 
i have another set that are coarser and prefer them . 
this popper does exactly what it s suppose to do . 
i will update this review if anything changes though !  . 
i decided to give these a try and am absolutely delighted . 
i am tired of my plain old bundt pan so i ordered this . 
one you put the soap and hot water in . 
they are not rugged enough for much else . 
but it does do well in the dishwasher . 
love the pink camo and the grey color . 
all ports and buttons are exposed as they should . 
my wife wanted these so that we could have taco salad . 
thy are also well balanced with fully tined handles . 
i like that it has the cutout for the camera and the speakers . 
it truly makes cleaning up the drips no trouble at all . 
i use the larger funnel and strainer for making milk kefir . 
the only problem you might have is with greasy foods . 
it is also great to use on the stove top ,  too . 
it makes coffee very quickly and easy to clean . 
it s a great size ,  not too big and not too small . 
all in all a good product for a good price . 
these pans were purchased to replace old ones that i had for years . 
i purchase whole beans at my favorite coffee shop . 
it does what it is meant to do . 
my num_num year old granddaughter was fascinated and helped me do the squeezing . 
i hate writing reviews it should be optional not required . 
my num_num year old is starting to wear scarves frequently . 
i use it with a samsung galaxy num_extend
we bought this waffle maker recently and it functions very well . 
this thing is the best tool i have ever used . 
our grandparents knew something that many people today don t know . 
i ve used this for flour ,  and it works just as well . 
i don t worry about fingerprints or scratches anymore . 
i have walked num_num feet from the phone with good reception . 
the first good surprise was it came in a week early . 
if you need something strong ,  then get this one . 
so thanks to the people who thought to mention it . 
when i opened the box i just expected num_num batteries and num_num cases . 
the smallest one was a perfect fit for me . 
the temperature on the trip hung in the mid teens . 
lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong . 
we love the style and appearance of the glassware . 
these tend to burn and make a mess . 
i bought this just for the microwave steamer function . 
i expected to spend atleast twice the cost of this one . 
i liked the pattern because it s floral without being overwhelming . 
$ a year in replacement filters is reasonable . 
just be aware that it might not stand up to heavy use . 
the thing is a complete and utter failure . 
this mixer is reconditioned ,  but it appears to be brand new . 
foul taste like paper behaves after the cup cakes baked . 
it blocks out most water and takes one hell of a licking . 
i tried to realign the screen protector but did not work . 
i also bought aotterbox commuter case for nokia num_extend  black to protect it . 
there is no securing a connection between to the two pieces . 
i have to say that this one is a great value . 
needed this to prevent my screen from being scratched . 
the grind appeared to be very even with very little dust . 
it is worth the wait and extra work . 
i had to use all my strength ,  and num_extend
it makes baking much more pleasurable . this tool has so many uses . 
oh well ,  might give it to my buddy . 
i ve loved fresh ground black pepper for a long ,  long time . 
two are currently in use ,  side by side in the refrigerator door . 
these headphone were the thing i was looking to . 
it cuts smoothly and holds the can securely . 
she asked for one of these ,  and she loves it . 
hard to tell the difference between the factory apple screen and this one . 
i received it ,  charged it ,  and it only took about num_extend
i got these to keep flavored vodka in the freezer . 
i use them for phone calls and listening to podcasts . 
this was bought to use with ipod classic and it works great . 
overall ,  i am quite happy with this purchase for the price . 
the bottom burr is not replaceable ,  which seems odd . 
i bought some at gmc ,  num_num tabs in a bottle . 
the one by pampered chef can t compare to this one . 
i love it ,  because it protects my iphone so well . 
just fill it each morning and wipe it clean every num_num days . 
they are easy to put on and easy to clean up afterwards . 
my point is :  well ,  my charger works just num_extend stars . 
you have to be careful to not heat the eggs too fast . 
only time will tell if the hold up . 
a red light was always blinking on it no matter what i did . 
due to the good reviews ,  i went with these . 
it works nicely in my non stick pans . 
on mine ,  it actually was a perfect fit . 
i love them both for different reasons : bought the mr . 
figure out another way ,  though or you will be destroying some edges . 
just don t expect it to out perform this classic . 
everyone who has all clad knows the quality of their products . 
this double bundt pan is heavy and cooks evenly . 
it was definitely worth the few dollars ,  i give this num_num stars . 
i ve read of some people complaining that these must not be originals . 
we have used manual can openers for years with great success . 
i also cut out bell peppers  red  for salads . 
that s the only reason for four instead of five stars !  . 
i would recommend this battery ,  based on the customer service . 
love the big knob and the way the handles fit in my hand . 
i have not bought a loaf of bread since i bought the machine . 
i really like the thiness of the turner . 
and listen to num_extend for about an hour or two . 
its like a more rubbery that platic which is good . 
they werevery helpful and answered all my questions . 
i can t think of enough superlatives to describe this product . 
not surprisingly the first meal i made with it was hamburgers . 
i feel so healthy eating hot air popcorn . 
it s also super easy to clean and diswasher safe . 
however it is now broke due to how many times it has dropped . 
the second issue revolves around the battery life . 
i use the battery with my num_extend to extend the current battery level . 
these jars are excellent for food storage in the pantry . 
if you want simple ,  but lacking power ,  iphone is the way . 
i purchased num_num of these for the office to use with skype calls . 
she can t even tell there s anything on it . 
it would also work nicely as a clothes hamper . 
i bought a blue one for my boyfriend for christmas and loved his . 
oh the wok spatula is very ,  very nice . 
at our local craft store each tip is $ so this was great . 
i ve never had any of the issues described here . 
i m here to tell you it s still in perfect condition . 
my old knife was not so handy ,  so bought this one . 
it really cleared the counter and our knife drawer . 
have not used the fruit roll up trays yet . 
perfect for the tiny cottage i had to move to last year . 
it will keep the phone safe for sure . 
i bought it for my num_extend and iphone num_extend
took me about num_extend with a metal file to make it fit . 
very happy with this case after a month s use . 
amazon is my go to shopping place ,  too . 
that makes this battery ideal for travel . count me very pleased . 
we like brita products and the filters work . 
it just wasn t what i was ultimately looking for . 
this is a very nice dish for the price . 
brita is synonymous with quality water filters and great taste . 
i adore this garlic press more than i can express . 
you cannot store cold and hot foods together in this . 
finally ,  i ordered it and hoped for the best . 
the more you add ,  the more spicy it will be . 
however the screen is cut off around the edges . 
i had one of these and wore it out . 
only wish it came with a useful case; maybe a wooden storage block . 
there is a previous review stating that lecreuset is delicate which is ridiculous . 
if you cook ,  you will like this pan . 
had difficulty removing rubber holders from the sinkworks . 
i bought this case num_num months ago ,  and still in good condition . 
unfortunately ,  it does not come with screen protector . 
these offer great protection for pans where the handles get hot . 
there are no rough or sharp seams in the glass anywhere . 
at least a workdays worth of battery life num_extend hours of heavy usage  . 
this machine is well designed and works very well . 
it scratches rather easily so be careful with clean up and cutting too . 
it was $ cheaper on amazon than at radio shack . 
protects well and looks good on any white iphone . 
the grill gets too much use to be constantly tucked away anyway . 
this pan is so easy to use and produces gorgeous results . 
i like it and it does protect the phone very well . 
 duh !   usually i remember these things ,  but not this time . 
the free shipping was an added bonus . this item is highly recommended . 
i had always wanted a juicer and this one has exceeded my expectations . 
i thought this was cheap ,  but there are cheaper apparently . 
this is lithium ,  like in a laptop or cell phone . 
no more choice between watery or burnt bottom rice . 
i towel off the rest of me in another thirty seconds . 
had one of these in my old house . 
but you are dealing with a microwave and they cook unevenly . 
super easy to use with partially frozen meats as the instrucions suggest . 
i am very pleased with the results of this diamond steel . 
for years i have seen this product in stores . 
my daughter s friends think im cool but silly too . 
one of the better phone protectors i ve had for sure . 
filter does a good job for a small space . 
i love this lil guy !  first off he s pink . 
my last grinder burnt out in a little over a year . 
i got num_num of these ,  and i wish i ordered num_num more . 
works great to keep my phone screen protected from scratches . 
i ordered this december num_extend num_num at around num_num pm . 
don t spend $ on an apple cable . highly recommended . 
i have always had one cooling rack and it s never enough . 
it heats up quickly and definitely puts out enough heat . 
as it ages ,  it is harder to maintain . 
saw them on cooks country and bought a set . 
this was the best case i have ever used . 
they fit in my hand very well ,  easy to use . 
brown it on the pan for no more than num_num seconds each side . 
as well as the limited choices out there ,  exceeded the negatives . 
the camera flash is the only definite problem . 
i tried the versatility unit out for this ,  and it worked well . 
the supplied cable with the two little adapters seems odd to me . 
originally bought it for a baby shower time game . 
good heavy metal ,  doesn t warp in the oven . 
however ,  i am very pleased with this mat so far . 
i m also considering making my own cloth filter out of organic muslin . 
didn t notice any changes in sensitivity while touching the screen . 
now i have the perfect cup of cappucino . 
otherwise the sound was very good  ,  i cannot overstate that . 
this time i looked for ways to get a better machine . 
i got it just in time to frost my strawberry dream cake . 
it s sturdy with a nice weight ,  and the handle is comfortable . 
it s resembles a small metal plate with four sections . 
i touch up the edge with a global diamond steel . 
i think that it was the result of a dull blade . 
my only complaint is that it is quite noisy . 
ill send photos because this case is great !  . 
the pricing is more attractive when you start finding other uses for it . 
the plastic lid nests with the aluminum pans as well . 
this is a lovely ,  heavy unit that works beautifully . 
i dropped the phone twice and it survived . 
imagine you have a tall bottle and a flat bowl . 
based on our opinion recommend without any reservation . 
i don t have a skin protector on the front either . 
just got the htc thunderbolt and decided to buy this . 
charger is easy to use and charges pretty quickly . 
this is the second of this item i have purchased . 
there used to be just a few choices when buying a kitchen appliance . 
she loved them so much she wore the battery right out . 
there are two other issues that are also worth mentioning . 
this knife is nice and heavy and very ,  very sharp . 
this is my first time using one of these contraptions . 
have not needed to get any water near it for  cleaning  . 
it has a net pocket inside and hard bodied . 
the cover is also very hard to take off . 
nobody in my family can tell the difference . 
the perfect way to keep my earrings organized . 
this product has been working well for a while . 
i use them with commercial cooking sheets ,  and they work great . 
i payed less than $ and it was worth it . 
they open wide so easy to clean and hold a variety of sizes . 
this is a headset with a microphone for video chat . 
i bought several in varying sizes and i love them . 
connected without any issues to his iphone and ipad . 
can t get the hubby to put his on . 
this will sure protect my daughters phone screen . 
this isn t meant for pro use or large quantity use . 
the lip though ,  as described to protect the face annoys me . 
then i saw the nordic ware popcorn popper on amazon and got it . 
i have a recipe that requires a bowl this shape and size . 
bought this in august ,  num_extend as a wedding gift for friends . 
ordered this charger after another brand didn t work . 
the convection cooks faster and leaves food moister than traditional ovens . 
the rosle is worth the extra cash if you have it . 
for daily use with reasonable care ,  this case offers good enough protection . 
i like that it auto shuts off when it runs out of water . 
if you need black icing ,  this is what you need . 
it has been too hot in so cal to use it . 
it comes off just as easy as it going on . 
can i just say that this blender is awesome . 
with care  don t put in dishwasher they will last a lifetime . 
they say it s extremely fast and they love it . 
i may order a second one for our other phone . 
i found this item in a local store for a few dollars . 
i bought this blender to mix my protein shakes . 
learn to use it and you ll like it . 
not easy to get started ,  but great once you get it going . 
takes seconds to install and holds our iphones securely . 
i am very impressed by this company s excellent customer service . 
within minutes this magazine rack was a doing its job . 
this grill cooks clean and delicious every time i use it . 
so after some research ,  i opted for the otterbox commuter case . 
i recommend the otterbox impact case over this one . 
ergonomically ,  it is comfortable to hold while mixing . 
pass and go for the bigger ,  cheaper ,  same brand french press . 
this spool mechanism is very flimsy and works about half the time . 
so every few years it the egg timer has to be replaced . 
you can also switch between the headset and the phone easily . 
a well designed stainless steel unit with a locking lid while under pressure . 
so buying a manual can opener made more since . 
i changed to jabra and i am impressed . 
love it dose it s job and can keep up with me . 
bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it . 
no issues with the size ,  it fit perfectly . 
the price was the final selling point for me . 
the price was right in my budget also . 
i even bought a set for my daughter . 
i ve had this tea maker for several years . 
touch pen goes right to it every text or email that i send . 
very fast and free shipping blew me away !  bravo !  . 
run it through the dishwasher to clean it . 
with the kitchen aid fga that is all solved . 
i use it for nearly everything now ,  wish i had one sooner . 
recently saw this same holder being sold at goodwill  used  for $
its temporary resting place is the dish drainer ;  . 
making it one of the best spatulas i ve ever owned . 
on second try at baking i made a complete bear . 
as most reviewers have already said these work well . 
for reasons too long to explain ,  i don t have a stove . 
i use one for work and use one for home . 
my iphone num_num charged in about num_num hours ,  at separate charging sessions . 
i keep it on a num_extend level bathroom floor . 
my sister bought this press for the house . 
not pushing my luck though ,  bringing them in for the winter . 
how much extra would it cost to lengthen the plunger rod by about   . 
typical lodge quality in a very large package . 
it works quickly and gives everything an nice fine and uniform grind . 
this are so nice and heavy you can just tell they will last . 
fill the bottom compartment with a cup or two of water . 
everything in the set seems high quality and i love the bright colors . 
again ,  if you are okay with this ,  then fine . 
i ve had one of these for about num_num years . 
they fried evenly ,  had a good color and tasted heavenly . 
this is a good replacement for the one we had . 
and once completed the lcd screen didn;t work . 
i bought this cable to connect my num_extend to the car radio . 
the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials . 
item was exactly what i expected and shipped on time . 
my purple skin matches the color indicated on website . 
but they will work better in a deep fryer . 
the handle makes it easy to hold on to . 
i had a braun grinder and coffee pot pair . 
and replacements are available if you happen to break the glass part . 
once they are clamped shut ,  they stay that way . 
whoa nelly !  the opera browser flies along with proper num_extend speeds . 
i recommend changing the water say ,  every few days . 
there s nothing i ve found that it won t mix or blend . 
kind of like my first experience with a mandoline . 
saves me the time of having to hand chop !  . 
the cost factor is reasonable and quality of construction is very good . 
my motorola atrix num_extend came with the num_extend model . 
it is fun to discover how useful this is . 
i put coffee in it every morning around num_extend am . 
i would not recomend puting into front pocket . 
like the fact that presto has replacement seals when needed . 
it is easy to use and easy to wash . 
i made a macaroni salad tonight and used this timer for my eggs . 
i gulped hard and ordered this case . it arrived . 
i had my screen cover on for about three months . 
but they never lasted for more than a week . 
spend the extra for this professional model and you will not be disappointed . 
this vacuum is attractive ,  well designed ,  and loaded with features . 
i immediately found the app store and poked around for some pretty backgrounds . 
this was a great cheap replacement battery cover for my droid x . 
it does its job to recharge and connect to computer . 
it s heavy enough not to warp but no heavier . 
there was minor abrasion to part of the side of the phone . 
some people may not mind but its just a little hard to push . 
for as long as i can remember my mom had a canister vacuum . 
the adhesive is very strong and so far is holding just fine . 
if you are usually mindful with your phone ,  get the commuter . 
i have no problems with these measuring cups . 
it s marvelous for making schnitzel and it gets the meat very thin . 
the menu or process for doing anything is maddening . 
that isn t an option on my other phone . 
i think i have every shape and size . 
maybe on the next go  round ,  it will be . 
it is a great package with all the accessories you will need . 
i discovered that the machine has to cool down between cycles . 
you just pour everything in and seperates the solids . 
i m happy to say that the rugs look new now . 
good cakes are the order at our house . 
once i put it on ,  i pretty much forget it is there . 
it also comes with an impressive number of attachments . 
it is solidly constructed  the handle gets a bit hot  and cooks evenly . 
this one is very sturdy and has a heavy duty rubberized handle . 
this seller really takes care of their customers . 
other than that ,  this is a basic android phone . 
update april num_extend num_extend this little headset is still going strong . 
note that there is some minor assembly required . 
i bought this item for my new iphone num_num but refuses to work . 
but i like that this one has a handle . 
i can drink it very strong and black because of this . 
you fold it back ,  and the headset turns off . 
it can be used in the oven to make cornbread . 
love the product and will not do without a set in my house . 
first of all ,  one can never go wrong with an oxo product . 
i purchased this anker product and it worked exactly as described . 
looking for a cross pan ,  i recommend this .

exactly what we were looking for and very reasonable . 
whoever thought of this did a fine job . 
very grippy ,  looks great on a white num_extend and offers good protection . 
i have not used these bottle stoppers yet . 
it has held up for him despite how rough he is with phones . 
now i don t have to use extension cords to charge my phone . 
to makea plain vanilla icing just omit thestrawberry jam and food coloring . 
it will be enjoyed by anyone who likes to soak in the tub .

the battery was already at % when it arrived . 
the dynamic sound of these headphones are great . 
i bought this for the gym and it works great .

we keep these frozen in the freezer for an easy grab . 
nice tool ,  works well ,  non mar in my pots . 
i found controlling volume to be very easy and very reliable . 
it s no otter box ,  but the price is great . 
no more wasting paper towels with this cover . 
they look great and i love the thickness and durability . 
this was a great buy for the price . 
used for breads lately as well as pizza . 
i had problem with it for a while; it kept dropping signals . 
it s much better than jolly time or the store brands . 
they re right about the impact of the angle of the cutting edge . 
this machine is sleek and looks fabulous in our kitchen  in licorice  . 
the accessories included in the kit worked very well . 
you need this special wrap when you use the sealing system . 
this is the best headset i have every had . 
it s still hot enough for me to drink until around num_extend
this press seems very sturdy ,  and is easy to clean . 
i had to get the smaller canner just for that reason . 
this service works superbly with yahoo and other email services like gmail .

after getting this pot ,  i no longer have this problem . 
it has lasted a while so i am very happy with this purchase . 
i bought a refurbished rumba about three months ago . 
i started my case hunt with the body glove hard rubberized case . 
because the material is relatively stiff it s fairly easy to avoid bubbles . 
the blades are sturdy and it s pretty well made . 
we have recommended it to all our fellow cooks .   .  .  .   . 
the thickness of the iphone is doubled by the case . 
youtube plays fine ,  although the resolution isn t that great . 
exactly what i expected in more of the sizes i needed . 
this is sturdy ,  works well and is well designed . 
needed a small ,  light duty ,  vacuum for our store . 
some readers have problems with the thermometer bracket ,  but i don t .

my latest oster s bread pan started leaking oil into the bread . 
i use my frequently for pounding boneless chicken . 
problemi found something i don t like about this bluetooth . 
needed to stop that before she spills or breaks something . 
this is a very attractive as well as functional kitchen device . 
it s nice to know the ingredients i m using are healthy . 
the wooden handle is a nice feature also to avoid burned fingers . 
i use it constantly to hold iced tea . 
i keep buying them again and again as they wear out .

another con ,  which isn t a big deal is rooting . 
this is easy to use and cuts beautifully . 
that s why i didn t give it num_num stars . 
at this price ,  what else you could ask ?  . 
the vinyl is supple ,  but shapped in a box type configuration . 
stir for a few seconds with a wooden or plastic spoon or stick . 
it was very cheap and is very cheap .

the other order may arrive in another two to five weeks .

the cake came out spongy soft and lifted right off the skillet . 
they came out perfectly cut ,  and the end result was amazing . 
so i thought i d give metal a try . 
the pedestal bottom is subtle and still allows for stacking when storing . 
 a number which he has had since num_extend and it works perfectly . 
in addition ,  they are not not for eating off of . 
overall ,  a good peace which makes me fully satisfied . 
it does make small tortillas ,  not num_num inch . 
yes ,  she is very happy and highly recommends this . 
now ,  i finish a drink and the ice is only halfway melted . 
until i cracked  or think i did  the glass ,  it worked perfectly . 
warm water and kosher salt  as an abrasive  . 
the first time i used this product was to cut up cucumber .

just you run of the mill popcorn popper . 
again ,  bought this item before already and the same product came in . 
the item arrived on time and in excellent condition . 
gave this to a friend ,  and she loved it . 
in another words ,  make sure you spray it first with baking spray . 
this is my favorite sized pyrex storage dish . 
this works great when creating any size tarts . 
good speaker sound quality  mic quality is also num_extend
this does a quick clean job and gives you a perfect edge . 
had this coffee maker in my family for ages . 
i got this so he could charge different phone from it . 
this will work for me for the time being . 
i obtained a new can opener that matched my new decor . 
they  the retailer  should take back the product or exchange it . 
i have been using it for num_num years now on all my stuff . 
only clear shell i have seen and i am quite happy with it . 
in fact worked better with my evo then with the factory charger . 
i intend to leave this to my grandkids in my will . 
this fan gives great performance for the price . 
it fits and looks like they were made for each other . 
my only warning is that it noes not come with a matching top . 
my stock battery died recently and i bought this one to replace it . 
vendor was responsive ,  offered refund and was good to work with . 
i would definitely recommend this to a friend . 
i am quite enamoured with this little utensil . 
our old one was brushed metal  i don t think it was chrome  . 
it s currently unavailable on amazon ,  probably sold out . 
it adds less than num_extend to the thickness of the num_extend
i would like to see some other designs and colors . 
some headphone and power plug ends bump into the rubber . 
after the install there were zero bubbles and it was a perfect fit . 
if it is true i d love to get one myself !   . 
in good outdoor light ,  the droid s camera is wonderful . 
you have to get use to cooking with it . 
we have baked bread about twice a week since we got our zojirushi . 
finally wore out my pro salad shooter and decided on this replacement . 
this is kitchen gear i use every day . 
these can be found at most grocery stores in the popcorn section . 
i don t really know why they drop audio . 
it ran over in gobs in the oven . 
with tons left over to do about num_num more phones if needed . 
it is very sturdy and easy to clean . 
other models that look about the same do not include the whisk attachments . 
so stop reading and buy one  actually two or three  !  . 
so ,  these pads just make a unstable surface for the speakers . 
i erred in initially judging this product by its appearance . 
this is hotter than my long term mr . 
num_num minute or num_num hours later i get fresh hot coffee . 
recommend for anybody looking to protect galaxy num_extend
we make pancakes on here ,  french toast ,  grilled cheese . 
so neither the liquid nor the hard stuff is first . 
this works good for helping make those fancy designs the bakery makes . 
much easier to spread icing with this than a knife . 
the point is ,  this little food processor is a godsend . 
it is easily rinsed clean and will air dry in a short time . 
although i hardly used it ,  it is nice and heavy . 
i certainly recommend them ,  expecially at this price ,  buy two !  . 
this supplier helps by providing good prices and delivery . 
the quality is good ,  if not the best . 
last fall ,  one of my dogs chewed through the power cord . 
configures quickly and has a very solid range . 
you ll have to keep them clean even though they re organized . 
my husband colored the cover with a black sharpie . 
i recommend that everyone have at least one . 
just the right size for a salad for two . 
i ve read online that this can be swapped for a conventional tip . 
i ve been using this fan for num_num summers now . 
it has a lot of power and works as advertised . 
he was a pro ,  and i d always made popcorn that way .

apple makes great products ,  and they also many great chargers for them . 
after a lifetime of vacuum purchases i will never switch !  !  !  . 
i expected the screen to have a large crack in it . 
maybe i didn t read the description throughly but it is plastic . 
i bought this off amazon for $ many years ago . 
now i use stainless steel and cast iron . 
it came in a nice package just like it shows . 
you just need to experiment with how long to grind for your purposes . 
i wanted a programmable timer and an automatic off mode . 
so easy to clean i don t use dish washer . 
this is like unicorn magic how well that baby works . 
all i need to do is the put the phone in the pod . 
i used wet solution included with another screen protector . 
i leave mine plugged in on the counter always . 
the deni num_extend works best on fully thawed meat . 
happy with colors which help me to easily locate and identify . 
i really like being able to set the strength of the tea . 
the finish on this skillet is the best i ve ever worked with . 
but nevertheless ,  i am impressed overall with this bluetooth headset s performance . 
it is a little on the large side but it works great . 
i recommend it as the primary knife sharpener in the house . 
i sure didn t expect to get such great foam . 
the only issue i have is cleaning it . 
this works better and cleanup is much easier . 
the uses for quick boiling water seem to be endless . 
it s definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler . 
it is secure and safe inside this potector . 
i like my home lattes better than what i get at starbucks . 
i think i once went through a num_num oz . 
i really like the feeling of the outside . 
some have complained about the screw holes not aligning properly . 
for the price ,  i think it s a great product !  . 
it s a little tricky to get it in and out . 
if there are burnt bits ,  scrub them out with salt . 
don t know why i haven t bought one of these before . 
heats quickly ,  so make the batter before plugging it in . 
we have used it every day for several years now without failure . 
i use a small brush to whisk out any residue in the frame . 
friends and family oohed and aahed when they saw the cake this makes . 
the sound quality is superb to my ears . 
it slides around a lot ,  which is why things can get scratched . 
it takes several hours to charge from a dead cold state . 
it s perfect !  !  !  not too tall or too short . 
and the plastic lids are good for that as well . 
many things run in the background that must run . 
now i m trying to get it to again and it won t . 
you can pop off a few prongs ,  it ll still stick . 
i bought one set as a gift and decided on something different . 
it continues to work perfectly and is so convenient . 
a nice addition to the competition in the bluetooth field . 
i don t know who would use a wet knife ,  but hey . 
it is definitely what i have been looking for . 
i saw this and thought why not try it . 
these pans are just what i needed for my countertop oven . 
i got the num_extend don t think i d want the num_extend
and it adds a nice glow to a room . 
the brita made a far more smoother cup of coffee . 
my all clad ltd num_extend fry pan is my most used pan . 
i have high hopes for this one ,  too . 
the quality is superb and it works like a charm . 
this very conveniently fits inside my pocket and is not uncomfortable . 
that s a great deal because i got it for num_extend
it took a lot of effort to remove it completely . 
my old one just wasn t doing its job anymore . 
this knife has the wusthof quality and is extremely versatile . 
it spins really smoothly ,  and i use it all the time . 
i did this before i even bought it . 
i wish some of these issues had been addressed by the reviewers . 
i now have two of them  two different kitchens  and love it . 
i primarily purchased this for the blowing aspect . 
can not complain ,  but i will recommend it . 
we use this to mix baby formula and it works great . 
if you re always on the phone it ll be handy . 
when my cell battery gets low i just swap it . 
however ,  it has been beyond sufficient for our needs . 
we re also glad other reviewers had mentioned a brush for cleaning . 
they were both good machines but the hoover was far better overall . 
i m a single fellow who prefers to cook than eat out . 
excellent zesting tool and is easy to use over food being prepared . 
my only complaint is ,  i cant use the belt clip holster . 
now i don t need to keep a wired headset around anymore . 
these jars are solid and the color pictured here is correct . 
the cakes come out beautifully like this blossom bundt pan . 
it works like a charm on lemons and limes . 
this case is not bad but not sturdy . 
our unit works great in a num_extend room . 
i wanted to buy a second set but they were always approx . 
this pot has come in handy for many of my weekly kitchen tasks . 
you can add a cherry garnish in this martini if you like . 
it weighs a lot more than your standard pen of the same dimensions . 
my only complaint is that you cannot put it in the dishwasher . 
it is easy to use and very comfortable on ear . 
luckily the place is just num_num minutes away . 
transmission of your voice ,  i would say ,  is good . 
it is a great and fast meal with a lot less trouble . 
if anyone knows ,  please reply to this review . p . s . 
and it is also wonderful for grating hard cheeses ,  nutmeg ,  etc . 
no ways this would work for a serious coffee drinker . 
however ,  they can be a little rust prone . 
also makes a nice wedding or shower gift . 
as i am always looking for that best price vs . 
would have been num_num star but it is a tad short . 
it is imprinted on the bottom of the pan . 
i highly recommend it as an essential for your next wilderness excursion . 
one set for my iphone num_extend one set for my son s iphone num_extend
with the ear hook my glasses stay in place . 
it works well with my phone the lg rumor touch . 
has the most options and makes great coffee for the price . 
battery last forever !  i charge it one every num_num months . 
nothing cooks better than cast iron . i highly recommend this cookware . 
always hand washed and working fine for past num_num months . 
nuts chop pretty well ,  but not that great . 
i ve been looking to replace some worn out ones . 
this is the num_extend bt headset that i ve owned . 
the popper itself is a bit awkward to clean . 
our issue was it would not stay connected . 
the unit is very small and seems to be very accurate . 
never realized the plain unvarnished snack could be so good . 
it s steady ,  and a good deal for the price . 
using them with fats is no problem either as they re stainless . 
it stretches enough to snap into place and stay on snugly . 
i think this design is more prone to cracking . 
as most french presses ,  it doesn t seal very well . 
even after six years ,  the knife is still reasonably sharp . 
we have moved away from plastics and utilize the glass containers . 
this is a direct replacement battery and works exactly as you d expect . 
a must haveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee . i love it . vibrant machine well built . 
i toss it in my suitcase without worrying about it being broken . 
it sprays the oil just as well as the plain sprayer . 
love that it connects only when i m in the car . 
this one is gorgeous !  i love this salad spinner because it works . 
both the silicon rubber and the plastic hard shell are in high quality . 
it is also very light and you barely notice you are wearing it . 
she loves it and wants to purchase another . 
so i dished out the money and made my pizza on it . 
after another num_extend you were about happy with it . 
not bad at all for these price points . 
but mine s in the center console ,  so it works fine . 
i was confused by the  spreader  as the directiions were ambiguous . 
the strength of the marinade seem stronger in the finished product as well . 
they do not stain ,  melt ,  or degrade in any way . 
remarkable the difference in taste ! so ,  on to the decanter . 
i love this thing and it makes my clean so quick and fast . 
i bought it to make fries ,  which i m doing today . 
the only detail known is the battery consumption . 
i don t really expect any of them to block out wind . 
i buy spices and herbs in bulk and share with my two kids . 
then use a credit card to push up the phone . 
my husband bought me one of these years ago and i loved it . 
at least once i ve forgotten it was even on . 
my worry about it being too loose or falling off was incorrect . 
i saw the reviews on this one and decided to get it . 
also ,  people have complained after the tefflon coating scrapping off . 
would make a nice wedding or housewarming gift !  recommended . 
i only use it for a minute or two at a time . 
a few of the spoons have ugly black pitting . 
dishwasher safe and a design that won t deteriorate . 
the cooking time is longer but worth the price living in an apartment . 
gee ,  it really isn t difficult . i bought a mr . 
it does exactly what i wanted it to do . 
num_extend is almost like carrying a hard drive with you . 
a green light tells you when the phone is being charged . 
they are amazing the screens last pretty much forever  :    . 
but ,  it s designed for the palm lineup of phones . 
it is simple yet makes all off your stove sauces come out perfect . 
i would have given it num_extend stars but that s not an option . 
i think the plastic measuring thing is sort of pointless . 
this product makes my soaker tub num_num inches deeper and i love it . 
i can t wait to start using this when i bake desserts . 
the kindle fire tablet increased from % to % in approximately num_num minutes . 
the filters last me about a month ,  which i guess is average . 
i purchased this after returning the cusinart grill . 
we tried a pot of coffee and it was delicious . 
i can be proud to display it anytime . 
i use these cutters for ceramics and clay projects . 
it took num_extend and num_num minutes ,  leaving % on the charger . 
most importantly i love the variety of sizes included . 
this was a huge upgrade in terms of quality and craftmanship for them . 
it is out of sight but oh so handy . 
it is a heavy duty press and not flimsy . 
it works fine except that the cord is only about num_num inches long . 
thus ,  i cannot comment on whether these are truly nonstick . 
it works great and is much cheaper then the ones at walgreens for $
for all your forking needs ,  this gets a big thumbs up !  . 
i also have three pets and all hardwood floors . 
exactly the size of the apple one i lost . 
i have had this knife for num_num years probably . 
moderate noise level ,  no clogging ,  and very little static . 
i purchased this item for my teenage daughter . 
so much better than the upright version honeywell makes . 
what am i going to use it for ?  i have no idea . 
i am very happy with the job it does and highly recommend . 
heck if my laptop breaks this is my spare portable device . 
we still run out and i may order another set . 
i thought the halo screen protector was awesome for my droid charge . 
the filtered water tastes just as good as bottled water ,  to me . 
the microphone is great ,  the sound quality from the headphones are great . 
i would give it more then num_num stars if i could . 
the parts came in two bags ,  with one labeled  correct parts  . 
the brightly colored markings are easy to read and are permanent . 
this keeps my bb charged all day long . 
i bought this to get rid of the knife block on the counter . 
very well made and the price was good as well . 
this added a touch of glamour to a lowly kitchen tool purchase . 
according to the directions ,  i can place the pot in the oven . 
i have since put a zagg invisi shield on my phone . 
no it does not leave marks on wood floors . 
was looking for a small size whisk and this fits the bill . 
at that point you ll get good nonstick performance . 
all in all you need to handtight crew in num_num screws . 
i use it to store my winter jackets in the summer time . 
i have all clad stainless cookware and swear by it . 
everything went well ,  a good dinner was had by all . 
but i still wanted that rubber cushioning ,  just not the sticky aspect . 
this really does belong in your emergency kit ,  along with your flashlight . 
i like this style with the beads that just roll across the bar . 
feel of the material is superior to any other phone i num_extend
this is a great case for the thunderbolt . 
i searched amazon for one i could afford . 
i had two of these were of inferior quality . 
very functional ,  sturdy and the neutral white color goes with everything . 
i bought this as a gift last year for the mrs . 
only giving it four stars because it s a bit pricey . 
you also keep your knuckles clean of frosting . 
you get accustomed very quickly to the blazing fast speeds . 
there is a car charger plug included with this mount . 
i wish it had a call end button on the thing . 
too bad i didn t buy the presto years ago . 
thus far ,  i ve not seen pixelskins for num_extend exclusively . 
it is thick enough to heat and cook evenly over the whole surface . 
i have read the other reviews and am confused . 
i hardly peel carrots anymore after a good cleaning with this brush . 
the one i use almost daily i bought in num_extend
as soon as i saw it i couldn t believe it . 
this one cleaned like a dream in a few minutes . 
since i got this knife my meat slices like butter . 
the flame tamer blows this one out of the water . 
like do it your self tacos ,  fresh roast chicken and rolls etc . 
i had the cuisinart grinder before and this one is much better . 
it s not high quality but it s great for leaving myself notes . 
the secret to tamping is trial and error . 
then i started buying pineapples on sale and cutting them up at home . 
it s hard for a business to  mess up  a bottle opener . 
but worked very well with the headset  klipsch image num_extend
i bought this for my iphone num_extend and it works perfectly . 
i like this knife so much i have bought several . 
it s simple to use and sturdy enough to last a long time . 
it also prevents water from getting to the phone . 
it does the job it was intended to do very well . 
let me start by saying i m not a coffee freak . 
i ve only found similar pricing for the num_num packs at stores . 
but is it worth the money ?  for me ,  yes . 
the volume control has big buttons and seems to work throughout windows . 
the angel does not look like an angel after i cut it out . 
it is like a wonderful multi layer flavored stew in just num_num minutes . 
this size is great for batters ,  including pancakes !  . 
the num_extend volume is loud  coming from the num_extend series it is loud  . 
this microplane gives a very fine grating ,  almost like a dusting . 
i have used it to make tons of paleo pasta . 
i would recommend these to anyone ,  the price can t be beat . 
if you don , t mind noise ,  then go for it !  . 
wash up well and thrown in the dishwasher didn t cause an issue . 
i remove the phone with the push of one button . 
i ve never experienced the melting plastic issue that another reviewer described . 
this left me with an awful mess of gooey stickey stuff . 
you might want to measure the destination space . 
other than the missing screen protector ,  good product . 
this is just what i was looking for . 
i have ordered two more ,  i simply love them . 
the design is subdued and the gunmetal gray front looks sharp . 
takes only a few slaps to flatten a chicken breast . 
it s really made to be in your bag . 
you may need to go back to the standard charging cable . 
i recommend this for anyone with dexterity issues in their hands . 
it also holds more than a num_num inch steaming basket . 
nothing wrong with these cutting boards at all . 
these cookie cutters make intricate shapes a snap . 
i like the neon yellow color to match my num_extend gen ipod touch . 
why anyone would spend money on microwave popcorn . 
by trying different angles i found more comfortable positions . 
i was surprised at the quality of this little rolling file cart . 
one thing that i immediately liked was how fast the water boils . 
i recently bought millet in seed form instead of flour form on accident . 
great for travel and recharging on the go . 
do not call your provider att if you don t have to . 
it turns color after being in the dishwasher . 
it is not a commercial mixer with a commercial warranty . one tip . 
the price is great as is the can opener . 
makes it so much easier to get the size item you want . 
i am very happy with my stovetop coffee maker . 
does the job with a great price tag . 
they came quickly and are great weight pans . 
i m still using these headsets and still love them . 
gets me jacked in the morning to start a hike . 
this is a great purchase totally worth every penny . 
they work as advertised and are also surprisingly heavy duty gauge metal . 
i ve learned a lot ,  and have had fun . 
it is one of my favorite cookware pieces . 
it conducts heat so well that low heat is all that s needed . 
the wusthof gourmet num_num inch knife is a good knife for the money . 
they came in handy for my graduation party . 
i am using canning jars for almost everything . 
but for normal back ground sound you will be pleased . 
when dry i spray coat it with pam and let it cool . 
it is sturdy and deep enough for a good sized doughnut . 
i bought this to help scooping muffins and for easier cookie portioning . 
i purchased this item to hold an arduino project . 
this item will completely recharge my iphone num_extend
try using this with turnips ,  pumpkin or squash . 
cuts well  sharp !   and fits nicely in my hand . 
i also added some wine to the ground pork mixture . 
for any coffee enthusiast ,  this is a must . 
it really goes to work without damaging the skin . 
i would say it takes one to two minutes to wash thoroughly . 
used to be a big microwave person until i discovered waterless cookware . 
not too small ,  nice size and very attractive . 
it is a bit loud but most blenders are . 
i purchased this thermometer specifically for my sourdough bread baking needs . 
it s good ,  but i wish it had two things . 
we got ours for about $ at a marshalls store . 
so the num_num inch model only has num_num inches of useable width . 
my iphone num_num could move around in it a little . 
they work better than the $ unit it replaced . 
it s fine in both portrait and landscape modes . 
works great to charge num_num devices at the same time . 
amazon will get this to you in a couple of days . 
and i m glad i got it in the all stainless steel . 
if you read the instructions then your unit will not leak . 
it s been on my phone for two years and still no issues . 
i worry about dropping them or breaking off the handles in the dishwasher . 
i don t know why i hesitated buying this . 
imagine all the fruit leather goodness we can make !  . 
there s a tag on the usb cord that says  vcast media manager  . 
it simple and easy to use and inexpensive . 
that is if the one i have ever stops working . 
i can use it in the oven or on the grill . 
the num_extend is fairly compact given that it is a num_num mah charger . 
whether your phone is white or black this case looks good either way . 
it does not leak and seals tight with the screw top two lids . 
it arrives in one piece and doesn t require any assembly . 
signals when preheated and when waffle is done ,  a plus . 
what more can i say ?  they are silpats . 
i absolutely love these num_num silicone covers for my cell phone . 
i haven t yet tried boiling ,  blanching or baking the chicken first . 
there isn t a single negative about this bread machine . 
but my original battery used to last longer when it was new . 
one of the best products i have used in some time . 
easy to spread ,  real butter whenever you want it . 
it looks like it will trap a lot of dust without clogging . 
the tank may seem small ,  but it s perfectly adequate . 
well priced ,  carbon activated ,  and easy to clean . 
the checkerboard look on the bowls are really cute . 
also add nearly boiling water as part of the cleaning solution each time . 
then ,  cool the cookie sheets ,  before reusing them . 
i bought this to replace one i already had just like it . 
the problem is the batter comes over the middle attachment . 
no hang ups or stalls ,  just powers right through . 
in stores they sell you these for $
and the seals are removable which i very much appreciate . 
it s not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker . 
i will update this comparison if performance changes over time . 
simple to replace original filter ,  competitive price to other retailers . 
i want to run them completely dead before recharging . 
in fairness ,  it last longer than the original cable . 
too bad oxo does not make one of stainless steel . 
no surprises there as the amazon photo is accurate . 
it was completely rusted ,  and i hadmy doubts that it was salvageable . 
what else is there to say about a knife ?  . 
i recommend kitchenaid products on the strength of this experience alone . 
this case does not add much bulk at all to phone . 
it is perfect for those overseas traveling or long road trips . 
i have listed what i consider pros and cons below . 
the spring loaded plate helps to disengage the spikes from the meat . 
cast iron cooking is healthy and items will last for a long time . 
i have been very dissatisfied with these products . 
i bought a second one as a gift . 
the black is significantly less on amazon and griffin is pushing custom colors . 
it offers a lot of functionality for the money . 
it s great to cook in and cleans up easily . 
our knives were pretty dull from amateur sharpening . 
first of all ,  lets get to the good news . 
it is great for dipping soups in deep pots than shallow ones . 
i placed the grind adjustment about in the middle of the range . 
it would be very difficult to make pasta with out this handy device . 
it now appears that the computer is shot . 
this is a brand new product from new trent . 
i can continue sipping on the way to the gym and back . 
easy to use ,  remove the product and cleans very easily . 
maybe it will wear in and become more pliable as it ages . 
just putting it out there for all you other ocders . 
i literally cook with this indoor grill everyday . 
for music i use an audiophile wired headset . 
performed the functions i needed to just as expected . 
as is ,  it still produces a fine well cooked waffle . 
this little sweeper is great for a quick pickup . 
i had some cheap ones that would slide off all the time . 
fast shipping ,  good quality ,  especially for the price . 
lodge logic num_num cornstick panlodge makes great quality cast iron . 
this is by far the best bluetooth speakerphone i ve tried . 
it is satisfyingly weighty and easy to clean the outside . 
this product arrived promptly ,  and is great for small space kitchen . 
it heats up very quickly in comparison ,  too . 
sticks on well and i haven t had any issues with it . 
another complaint was that the handle was hard to release . 
stays flush and elegant plugged in the car lighter . 
i was excited to get it so wasn t paying attention . 
i haven t had any trouble with the probe . 
i hate holding my phone on my ear so this save my strength . 
don t want to plug it into the wall ?  no problem . 
i ve had this mincer for almost a year . 
but either way ,  you d probably get frustrated with the fit . 
has a finger print scanner that works great . 
so far has been staying on very nice . 
i purchased for the htc hero for sprint ,  and it fit perfectly . 
i took off a star to cover all of the issues . 
i also am amazed as to how well it sharpens . 
poached eggs are a very civilized breakfast food . 
and it works perfectly and delivered on time  :   . 
good quality does cost more ,  so i buy it anyway . 
they cut great ,  never need sharpening ,  and go with everything . 
i purchased num_num farberware pots and have been very happy ,  so far . 
i use this one in the kitchen ,  and it works very well . 
shipped fast and received in time for christmas even though i ordered late . 
there were no instructions provided but i ve installed similar screen protectors before . 
the one other issue i have besides the thickness is the weight . 
that is to say ,  it doesn t fit in your pocket . 
of water ,  cracked egg in and added another t . 
well ,  you get what you pay for ,  i guess . 
makes you want to keep the case on the phone !  great case . 
that worked perfectly ,  and is invisible  since the headset is black  . 
i had to reinstall it with double face tape on the cup . 
skinomi has great products and excellent customer service . 
overall ,  this is a really good product for a great price . 
not only is it not very wide ,  it isn t very tall . 
you can check verizon s community forums for information about the updates . 
every time we spoke he was making some kind of panini sandwich . 
when i want clean coffee i use the chemex with paper . 
this pan gets the job done but it is a bit flimsy . 
i am happy with the product ,  and arrival of the item . 
i used the same brand while on vacation and loved it . 
it works very well for both lemons and limes . 
i have no fear of coins or toher materials that could damage touch . 
i hate huge tongs bc they make handling foods pretty difficult . 
it is the third battery i ve used in this phone . 
a grater works well but so does this device . 
we use it on a two burner camp chef stove . 
i have the brita my mom had and it s still going strong . 
our big pots that are frequently used  like this one  hang within reach . 
as far as the product itself ,  it works well . 
otherwise this is a great product ,  and well worth the cost . 
the consistency of the garlic once pressed is absolutely perfect and uniform . 
it was worth every penny and more  !  . 
i look forward to many years with my new bundt pan . 
it matches the dish drain and dryer rack i also ordered . 
it was really nice that it did hold % extra charge . 
this has to be the best item i took along on my trip . 
and they held up my first cake really well . 
i love the feel of this in the hand . 
i haven t found anything i couldn t cut very well with this . 
it preserves any unused wine so you have no waste . 
the controls worked fine also to skip songs . 
what i want to emphasize here is the packaging . 
i bought this to use on my soap making . 
it s not sophisticated ,  but it s a very good grinder . 
it cracks nuts ,  what else can i say . 
my plants are smiling at me ! it is now dec . 
this is a phenomenal case ,  it s fits just perfect . 
i would purchase this phone case again or for friends . 
they are easy to remove and replace on the ring . 
it s a one piece hard case which i really like . 
i bought this in num_num and still use it for my iron cord . 
it arrived within a week in excellent condition . 
life is too short to have to struggle to open a can . 
also nice under mixing bowls to keep them stable when mixing batters . 
well designed product for getting the sponge and drain plug off the counter . 
the low blade grinds much more evenly ,  much more quietly . 
i have never had a problem with a broken carafe . 
i was so nervous ,  but it worked so well ,  no worries . 
but the consistent smoothness is well worth it . 
blows quite a bit more air flow than i thought it would . 
it was my favorite color pink ,  and the pink was very vibrant . 
i love this one best of all the ones i ordered . 
i ve had my set for years and use it regularly . 
i purchased it here due to being a prime member . 
but you do have to fix it up . 
plus ,  it stands up to the beating i give it . 
received this product well packaged and in perfect condition . 
 except when chopping herbs that create a lot of juice like parsley  . 
there s no problem with the lid if you screw it in properly . 
don t get me wrong ,  it is well made and well designed . 
power led is small and on the side  hard to num_extend
i ordered one ,  liked it so well ,  i bought another . 
i use these cups on a daily basis and they are well made . 
it replaces an older model ,  but seems more powerful . 
i bought this battery pack for my droid and my kindle fire . 
certainly one of the best deals ever on amazon ,  my favorite store . 
the twin paddles definitely work better than a single . 
first ,  it is a durable nylon and won t scratch your cookingware . 
the fit is superb and the support is excellent . 
absolutely the same cord that came with my htc phone !  . 
keep this in our other car just in case i need a charge . 
these are a nice weight and feel good in your hands . 
the best thing about these shelves is how lightweight they are . 
ive seen this online several times and actually never thought anything of it . 
it helps ,  but not as much as i would like . 
these glasses have a nice weight to them and they feel very sturdy . 
big chunks of cooked turkey chopped evenly and smoothly without pureeing . 
it also has a num_num year warranty included . 
i m a big fan of most oxo products . 
what a waste that we didn t just get this from the start . 
in any event this little pan is still good as new . 
however ,  my first one cracked within a month around the power button . 
it cooked them well and keeps them warm while other things cook . 
i did not expect them to sound as good as they do . 
keeps everything from getting tangled in the headset . 
the timer is very easy to program ,  as is the clock . 
mine is for home use and two people . 
but a quick run through the dishwasher cleaned them up nicely . 
and the size is perffect for small rooms . 
i really liked it and was amazed at how little time it took . 
i am not a barista; i don t understand everything about coffee . 
this is just a great ,  old fashion pitcher . 
this is the gold standard in fondue pots . 
works it u know what u are doing i do recommend it . 
i ve used food saver brand as well as rival brand . 
i am so very satisfied with my first bread maker . 
has a small dish that slides in the side that catches greasy runoff . 
i bought this to replace a worn out cake pan . 
my only complaint is that it stretched out too quickly . 
i like the curve of the swivel peeler . 
have had other poachers  cheaper ones  and this is well worth the investment . 
the medium and low setting are much quieter . 
this one is the most comfortable and has great sound . 
but i have to say the kitchenaid products are definitely made to last . 
based on mainly positive reviews and prime shipping ,  i ordered these . 
this crystal set is really beautiful without breaking the bank . 
you have to turn it on ,  it s off by default . 
had one and it got lost in a move . 
it looks well made and works just fine . 
there are spinners out there that boast of washing and drying . 
and the color goes great with my kitchen update . 
it looks great in the dark as well . 
this dresser is sturdy enough and the drawers open very smoothy . 
i use this car charger all the time . 
i make lots of nut butters ,  pestos ,  hummus and guacamole . 
so i bought him this little one that hangs in the closest . 
start out with this small set remember num_num pc refers to lids also . 
so i imagine it can charge a number of batteries . 
this pan bakes evenly and is very easy to release baked item . 
it is a lot nicer than i thought it would be . 
the holes on this product were glass smooth . 
this is the best can opener i ve ever owned . 
this stylus works very well and is very sensitive . 
this one certainly filled the bill . the pan heats quickly and evenly . 
the only thing i would say negative about this case is assembling . 
i seen better ,  but they were more expensive though better features . 
the smell is not so great ,  but it dissipates quickly . 
there is no comparison to the three other devices i have had . 
this is a real nice addition to my kitchen . 
now i eat food without any smell of plastics . 
generously sized head lets you clean a nice wide path at each swipe . 
this is one of the cheapest and best chargers you ll find . 
bottom is split and the piece above the dock connector has broken off . 
and the convection feature makes the best baked potatos . 
this battery should have came standard with the phone . 
charges and runs the phone and what not . 
this nifty bluetooth headphones set does not disappoint . 
love the way it makes the phone look . 
i ve also noticed some inconsistancy from loaf to loaf . 
they are a turkish company that makes fine leather cases . 
i wonder when companies like calphalon will get a clue ?  ?  ?  . 
good price and it works fine so far . 
we will get a lot of use out of this appliance . 
you ll soon understand why our grandmothers cherished them . 
they also recommend putting some vaseline on the seal . 
the headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster . 
it is comfortable to wear and provide very decent sound quality num_extend
the addition of wifi is a nice added bonus . 
in this case with the sensation the battery door is made differently . 
i would have a hard time paying $ or $ for it though . 
i have long been a fan of chicago cutlery . 
i love the glasses ,  sent back the num_num oz . 
this is a set of protection screens for an iphone num_extend
extended the life for a few more hours than the original battery . 
it has a hard outside shell with a soft lining to prevent scratching . 
i can t say anything that hasn t been said . 
some of the transformers i bought would only charge iphones . 
on the one hand ,  it s just a can opener . 
i easily downloaded my pics and saved a lot of money . 
apparently ,  it was because i submerged it in water . 
we shall see how it stands up to the test of time . 
it is my num_extend jamnbox wireless bluetooth speaker . 
like all oxo products ,  it s well constructed and ergonomic . 
i ve even dropped it a few times and it was completely protected . 
i use it for all types of breads . 
can t do that so good with this kind of can opener . 
they have great weight and balance and cut very well . 
i can not state it simpler than the title of this review . 
several bought at tmobile and they don t last very long . 
wish i would have know about this when i was working . 
one of my favorite and most used appliances !  . 
off the heat ,  the coffee stays hot for about num_num minutes . 
i d use it that way even if i left the magnet on . 
but then i have never tried a heavier iron . 
these are ok ,  but they re kind of annoying . 
this item arrived in a timely manner and would recommend the seller . 
that was a very pleasant surprise for a quality item such as this . 
just like moms !  heavyweight ,  even heating and american made . 
overall a great deal ,  and i recommend it . 
wetting the film and hands second time helped once again . 
has a reputation for quality that this finish did not meet . 
i expect it would add to the durability as well . 
it s extremely versatile and cooks very nicely and evenly . 
highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset . 
the armband is a great addition to my workout program . 
best to cover the pan with a spatter screen though . 
i have been using this pitcher for about num_num months . 
the itorch charge is relatively fast , just a few hours . 
i love the little stainless steel pot too . 
we recently purchased a new oven featuring num_num induction heating sites . 
i purchased this at a price which was impossible to pass up . 
i actually bruised my thumb pushing on it . 
did exactly what it is made for with no worries . 
they may prove useful for dips or sauces . 
hangs on the wall  out of the way  . 
it is sturdy and the mechanism works smoothly . 
i also bought the potato peeler ,  both work great !  . 
it is brilliant and does not take up much space . 
it is like the one in the hampton inn . 
i should have known they would be here . 
i love these little things so much .  .  . it came speedily . 
it does a great job and makes the grinding pretty much fun . 
this is a huge rice cooker ,  and it s not very aesthically num_extend
but the pan makes great tasting bundt cakes . 
great inexpensive replacements for my aging wooden spoons that finally gave up . 
if you cook ,  this can be a real time and money saver . 
don t use the breville much now ,  except for toasting . 
they re also cheaper and well worth the money . 
i am using a new num_num cup mr . 
even if you are just cooking for num_extend
super easy to use and has worked flawlessly since i opened the package . 
the unit came in nice secure box and no damage and no complain . 
it is light and easy to clean and store . 
this is absolutely a good value for the money . 
bought for a christmas present won t know anything about it until then . 
theories about aluminum poisoning were discredited long ago . 
this is exactly what i ve been searching for the past several years . 
unlike some toasters the heat settings actually mean something . 
i was surprised when i opened the package to find num_num different cases . 
a great compact set of round plain edge biscuit cutter set . 
i tried to clean it but the ring would not come out . 
i don t think it s one of the must have pieces . 
perfect size for grabbing salad ,  picking up spaghetti . 
i was happy to find a silicon case at a good price .

loose leaf tea works very well in this . 
the hard plastic is fitted perfectly and snuggly . 
efficient ,  heavy duty  ,  but also heavy for older people . 
i saw these ,  they got great reviews ,  and bought them . 
i use mine for a french press and espresso . 
i am thrilled that i bought this little wonder . 
i would recommend it when you need a new battery for your phone . 
dump the grounds out of the basket and rinse the basket . 
when i received this ,  i was surprised by the size . 
not to say i regret the purchase ,  it is comfortable for me . 
these hangers have a non slip sleeve where the garment touches the hanger . 
i also really like the options for programming the coffeemaker . 
would i take this everywhere i go ?  maybe not . 
they are quite handsome and would make an impressive gift . 
you can see a readout of the current temp . 
this popcorn popper was recommended to us by a chef friend .

never had to replace them before we got our new phones . 
i highly recommend this to anyone buying a secondary charger . 
easy to clean ,  easy to use ,  easy to store . 
i have an iphone num_extend and it fits perfectly . 
one large gear houses a motor which drives the gears when meshed well . 
i love this can measure two temps at one time . 
your medium rare burger is likely to contain some medium rare pork . 
i don t mind screwing them on myself the first time . 
the blade is relatively easy to clean as well . 
the handles are solid ,  the whole pot is solid . 
so that i can boil water in hotel room . 
i had no problems with smells or anything ?  don t hesitate . 
it is not like any other can opener you have ever used ever . 
i still wish it was only about num_extend
this is the bumper i use on my phone everyday . 
the pan and bread are both cooling off on a rack . 
i ve been using this peeler almost daily for two years . 
they work just fine and have held up so far . 
this is the only the second drawback i ve found . 
the red one hasn t done that yet so knock on wood . 
i am very happy with this and i entertain a lot . 
it was so easy to use and easy to clean . 
i have several oxo good grips products; this is my favorite by far . 
clean up is never something to look forward to . 
i can use it for hot pot  shabu  or as a grill . 
make brown rice at least twice a week . 
it is very difficult to get off once in place . 
press and hold for voice commands  search ,  note ,  call ,  text  . 
these have been great to clean up the mess . 
this pot will do until or if ever that happens . 
anker ,  keep up the good work and very attractive prices . 
it is also a great recipe with four cups milk and no cream . 
you feel it in your hand the cutting and solidness of this blender . 
the second num_extend is actually a pretty good phone . 
this one was affordable and easy to use . 
the num_extend and num_extend were decent ,  but had some reliability problems . 
charged a bunch of the girlscout parents phones . 
this machine makes quick work of anything you want to slice or shred . 
i love the colors pink and grey ,  its a cute case . 
feels pretty durable yet lightweight ,  but i haven t dropped it . 
i bought it to replace one that was showings it s age . 
works great for anything you need to double strain like soups . 
i was not ,  and it was not pretty . 
i also have a few of the shenzhen knives ceramic knives . 
also ,  it does seem to get water stuck in the top . 
also on occasion it acts strange when i try to do voice commands . 
i am a single guy who lives on my own . 
continues to work well after many months of use . 
was so wonderful to have a new battery for my phone . 
easily adjusts to fit wherever you want it to . 
excellent quality ,  very user friendly ,  and really well priced . 
great for when company comes over and don t need to worry . 
it is everything that it says it is . 
i used it for gluten free pasta the other night . 
it is sturdy and it is easy to keep clean . 
check out the reviews and decide for yourself . 
we run it through the dishwasher and still holds up great . 
best looking of the three cover i bought . 
so i thought this item might help me in resolving that issue . 
the dimension i have in mind is thickness . 
there is not much to gloat about on this case . 
this was pretty much exactly what i expected and what i wanted . 
i will be using it for canning very soon . 
and i think i have one more to buy . 
turn the crumpets over and cook for another num_num num_extend
for the price these are a great pair of headphones . 
this one i will use for spice grinding . 
bento will be a lovely addition to your lunchbreak . 
i ve dropped this a few times; screen is still great . 
it was easy for it to connect with my phone . 
you can also use the included wire if you need to . 
goes great with the bread knife made by the same company . 
they come apart in num_num pieces so you can clean them thoroughly . 
i think those are excellent products as well . 
great just what i needed for my grandson . 
this was given as part of a wedding gift set . 
not a bad price for the use that you get from them either . 
the one and only reason i purchased this is because it s retractable . 
so far for my iphone i ve had num_num other cases . 
i would recommend this product to someone else . 
no complaints ,  and i might buy another one for spice grinding . 
just tighten it enough so that it doesn t leak . 
no battery interruptions ,  no dropped calls ,  no nothing . 
it has a plastic tank ,  and plastic tubing folks . 
num_num out of num_num stars for non replaceable battery . 
this container replaces the over the shower head hanging rack . 
allow those ingredients to warm slightly priorto dumping them into the num_extend
as far as grill marks ,  i think you want them . 
it was also not going to ever be cleaned up as new . 
you can t beat it for the price and functionality . 
the popped corn itself it very light and airy . 
i highly recommend if you do have this phone . 
but they will stand the test of time in your garage . 
i bought these to use with my jawbone era bluetooth headset . 
works great ,  charges great ,  looks great . i m really thankful . 
you have plenty of attachments to make what ever shape you need . 
these cone filters work great for my gevalia coffee maker . 
i use it all the time for lots of different foods . 
had to get replacement after short period of time . 
my house would be much messier if it weren t for this vac . 
i ordered these tops to use to make yogurt . 
this feature makes all the difference in the world . 
just what i needed to replace the worn out battery . 
just was sad how quick the white got dirty so num_extend
this should last for many years to come . 
all in all i would recommend this product to others . 
not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected .

i think this item looks just as good or better than the picture . 
this pan is as close to my ideal as i could get . 
slips on easily ,  feels good when you hold it . 
i needed a large heart to make pup loaf for valentines day . 
easy to use ,  the rack did what it was advertised to do . 
keep your thumb on the lid when pouring . 
overall ,  it is a decent unit ,  and easy to use . 
it s my favorite brand of kitchen bakeware  next to kitchen aid  . 
otherwise ,  it would have gotten a five star . 
will a henckels hold an edge slightly longer ?  sure . 
i got rid of all my teflon pans . 
forget iphone ,  im just fine with my evo . 
we are extremely picky with our kitchen utensils . 
i have been cooking on cast iron for over num_num years . 
this item should never be used by children . 
i bought this case along with a few others at the same time . 
but don t think i would keep that up . 
it will also convert to a punch bowl . 
it took me around ten minutes to actually loosen the darn thing . 
it would be nice if it came with a spare filter . 
fits well in pockets attached to your phone and charges fast !  !  . 
the camera lens was in great condition and popped right in !  . 
the pastry cloth is the best i have ever used . 
the box was inside another box surrounded by air bags . 
the fault may lie in the recipe book . 
we have a rather large living room num_extend and i m a smoker . 
it charged from % to % in num_extend hours . 
i like these canisters and they are priced right . 
this does just as it says it will . 
have not made anything yet that it can not handle . 
i use this charger for both my playbook and my blackberry bold num_extend
this doesn t mean there is anything wrong with it . 
got this as a gift for my husband . 
of any other skillets i have purchased ,  i would stick with lodge . 
fits perfectly and has not lost its color . 
i look forward to getting reactions from guests !  . 
i have mixed pudding and other things with it . 
the one that came with the jar finally cracked out and leaked . 
people have been drinking coffee since at least the num_extend century . 
as a added bonus ,  it also comes with a car charger . 
after that is completed ,  the next upgrade is to nokia belle . 
its sleek and slim ,  works well with the phone and chargers . 
it looks good ,  but we ll see how that goes . 
took a while to get ,  but am happy with the product . 
need the battery life for an entire day . 
too bad i only change it every num_num months . 
this is much simpler than applying those clear sheets you can buy online . 
i use the recipe for wheat bread using volume ,  not weight . 
no extra calories or grease or chance of burning down the house . 
this popcorn popper is so easy to use . 
these work to close cereal bags  in the box  . 
i love the size of this nordic ware bundt pan . 
great pan to fry in especially steak and meats . 
this battery has to be charged once a day . 
i had almost given up on finding a good manual can opener . 
i used this potato ricer to make gnocchi . 
it gives your iphone a beautiful red num_extend
this lets me power up anything with a usb connection . 
the metal is thick and i can t see this bending . 
i m not going to grind coffee beans though . 
i actually liked the looks of their microwave plate cover better . 
i like the metallic color ,  goes with any kitchen . 
i found mostly good reviews but there were a few bad ones too . 
it s a small capacity but works for me . 
cake came out easily and in one piece . 
it works perfectly and it looks like a work of art . 
i use this daily for grinding flax seed . 
i ll have to be creative to find more uses for it . 
if you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go . 
i would have given a num_num star rating but for the price . 
i thought it would be more useful because it takes less room . 
then you may remove it onto a plate . 
i don t have enough sockets in a small studio apt . 
will get alot of use out of them . 
i use it mostly for scooping up things i have diced and chopped . 
i ordered this case and was absolutely thrilled . 
i then wiped the mat off and started baking cookies . 
have used the unit couple times since with no problems . 
the storage container for this one is excellent . 
they always come ahead of time and they work great . 
a good addon would be an extra container for rice . 
this will remove the plating and the metal will continue to oxidize . 
we use the gold filter and love it . 
this was my first ever headset ,  bluetooth or not . 
we can talk and he doesn t have to worrie about his phone . 
i bought three of these to use as storage canisters . 
if it ever breaks ,  i am buying a copy . 
it is worth it for that alone to me . 
so ,  it was time for a new one . 
the other two are excellent and i intend to order three more . 
it works perfectly with my samsung galaxy s iii . 
i don t find the pins difficult to use . 
i always use screen protectors for my phone . 
it is nicely made and has a sturdy clip . 
the knife is dishwasher safe ,  but hand washing is recommended . 
i was always careful never to get it wet . 
i found the num_extend socket charged any of our smart phones too slowly . 
i m happy with this purchase and will recommend this cover to others . 
the smaller the pizzas ,  the less time they need to cook . 
exactly like the ones you find in the store . 
nice and sturdy and stacks easily . i use them a lot . 
my biggest problem is that the fingers slide laterally almost too easily . 
large enough for bread loaf plus additional baked goods . 
my mother has used this rolling pin for two years ,  daily . 
one great skillet for frying bacon and making corn bread . 
they look nice in my bathroom with a simple polished look . 
i love my photon ,  and wanted a holster to go with it . 
anything that can hold a filter is good enough for me . 
trust this case to keep my iphone safe . 
if it doesn t we re going with the survivor brand iphone cover . 
and this set well last a very long time . 
this time it went in properly and has worked fine ever since . 
those of you with children should be aware if this point . 
i hate to think how many calories they contained !  . 
i m certainly enjoying it and can easily recommend it to others . 
this can opener is not only pretty ,  but easy to use . 
overall very good item and price beats any electronic store around . 
if you re looking for a num_extend case ,  look no further . 
you can easily find large travel tumblers ,  although travel diffusers are limited . 
length makes it a little short for my hand . 
fissler is still made in germany and the product is fantastic . 
unfortunately people think that this item can replace a heavy duty vacuum . 
 people state that the don t want to turn the brightness down from num_extend
i ve had this screen protector on other phones . 
if you drink your coffee black ,  you might not have this problem . 
i used these on long shifts at work and they remain conffortable !  . 
this is the best thing i could have done for my electric bill . 
easy to clean ,  makes me some super fluffy eggs . 
it is a bit pricey but may be worth it . 
i would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a peeler . 
i like the design of having the two merged into one . 
the bass is truly one of a kind . 
using cloths to wipe up following the steam was fast and easy . 
i just had one issue with this thing . 
i am speechless with how amazing it works . 
as described by other reviewers ,  it kinda does everything . 
however ,  while they do work ,  they are perfect . 
this works well for me in my office . 
i have used this and it works well . 
the connection is always good and the battery life has been fantastic . 
still have num_num led lights showing remaining charge .

the chop ,  slice ,  julienne all worked as expected . 
just what i was looking for at a reasonable price . 
i use this charger for my two spare batteries for my evo num_extend
we have not used it with a phone . 
this procedure was painless and the results were fantastic . 
my online and telephone experience with frieling usa has been excellent . 
the hard shell case is the way to go . 
the price for this used phone was right on target . 
i won t lie; for this price you d expect the adapter . 
try this ,  and you will never be able to go back . 
i factor this in to my processing time . 
the cutting head pops off for easy cleaning in the dishwasher . 
i would recommend the cuisinart brew central coffee maker to anyone . 
you need to be fast to see it . 
it s perfect !  and the price is good too . 
i ve held it for a while with no heat coming through . 
this motorola charger charges all of them without any problems . 
had to scour the internet for additional drivers for windows num_extend
i find more uses for it all the time !  . 
i ll update this again after this has been completed . 
the build quality of the iphone num_num is superb . 
these started coming loose and even coming off after several months  use . 
this is great for keeping things clean and easy to use . 
everything but the main unit goes in the dishwasher . 
comfortable to use ,  a bit big for storage in a drawer . 
the espresso is so much more intense when its heavily tamped . 
after buying this i think i will try other products by waring . 
great price and works like it was advertised . 
the num_num cup bowl comes in handy too . 
she has not had any problems with it . 
i got it in a deal for $
i do have it loaded down and so far it s holding up . 
there are many steak knives on the market at various prices . 
so the deformed green bottom was against the floor . 
i had dropped my iphone from about ten feet and it survived . 
this was the final case of three which i had chosen . 
i expect they will last a long time and are a good value . 
i just love this pitcher !  i got it in black . 
you can set it to go on later . 
the button does not work for my verizon phone ,  either . 
my grandson slept in this bed the first time at about num_num months . 
i will update if i run into any problems . 
take apart the racks and place them in a dishwasher .

i need some in black to match new granite countertops ,  at least . 
it was comfortable to hang onto and easy to release the dough . 
i wish i could give it num_num stars !  . 
it is great !  well worth the couple extra pennies . 
i will definitely buy another one when needed . 
i would recommend it to anyone looking for just a great stylus . 
the steak knives fit perfectly in the allotted slots . 
i also don t make pancakes in it very often . 
for small amounts ,  no need to haul out the big food processor . 
these pans are well made ,  are quite strong and light weight . 
for the price ,  you can t beat a buy like this . 
perfect condition and works perfect to charge my iphone . 
the key is the headphones must be fully retracted . 
wish it made that sound like i remember when i was little . 
maybe i should not have used the dishwasher . 
the name speaks for the quality and the price is great too !  . 
i received several wusthof knives as a wedding gift ,  including this set . 
i really like how this type of pan cooks . 
i have always disliked the decanter sitting on a warming plate . 
ordered this battery for my son s samsung replenish . 
audio quality from num_num pin is higher than from aux . 
i have a feeling more tubs are not like mine . 
works perfectly keeping my coffee nice and hot as i prefer it . 
everything looks like the original from apple ,  and it is only about $
the num_num for num_num promo beats local retail on similar product . 
i get three or four cups from this french press . 
being careful with is is the order of the day . 
they can easily hold multiple sheets of paper ,  pictures and a calendar . 
so ,  it s probably better that it not be present . 
backup assistant is also a new icon that magically appeared . 
i love pyrex !  great quality for a reasonable price . 
a good car charger for your apple product . 
i love the num_num inch tongs bc they make food handling easier . 
the instructions are clear and easy to follow .

we got a mirro num_num qt as a wedding gift . 
and this puts a pretty good ,  decent edge onto your knives . 
jabra makes some great headsets and i expected a great speakerphone . 
i wish they offered a boning knife to match . 
its cute and a nice addition to my phone case collection . 
it s also beautiful looking and made in the usa . 
my husband loves his fryer for making fish for his friends and family . 
these whisk brooms are better than the natural fiber ones . 
i have never been a big fan of earbuds . 
like the fact i can select the length of the bag . 
forget the bottom plate and just chop on your cutting board . 
always wanted one and i used it for the first time for thanksgiving . 
can t wait to use my cookbooks with this . 
we only decided to buy another set because our slicer broke . 
the cap doubles as a cup on the go . 
however i use the num_num while sitting at my desk at work . 
and i get a lot of compliments on it . 
love the unlimited text that you get with this plan too . 
this little gadget has saved me time and pain . 
i made a cranberry apple coffee cake for the holidays using this pan . 
and the easier it is to get the bubbles out . 
there is a review here by upperdown that explains the process throughly . 
i don t ever cook with the cast iron pans in my house . 
but their is a weird texture to the screen protector . 
once you use this ,  you will never want to use anything else . 
this oxo spinner was noticably different the first time we used it . 
but buying a rugged phone and a plan is outrageously expensive . 
doesn t overheat and looks pretty cool with the blue led . 
this thing is very quiet and easy to clean . 
this french press functions awesomely and looks awesome to boot . 
backup batter life by having the battery case num_extend
this toaster works very well; does what the controls say . 
i ordered one in addition and ended up not needing it . 
another great oxo product ,  the are very well made and super functional . 
the oil is already on it and it s ready to go . 
i am really happy with my decision to purchase this particular juicer . 
i love the smaller size of this platter . 
any disconnect i think must be apple s fault !  . 
for less than $ you cut your cooking time in half . 
it is quite comfortable and easy to slip into a pocket . 
i throw them right in the dishwasher and have no problem with them . 
after num_num years it had a problem with the speed control . 
the product meets the description and it is priced well . 
so i bought this just for that task . 
it opens up and cleans up well also . 
it satisfies all of my basic requirements ,  and then some . 
i read some reviews on them that said they were flimsy . 
this can opener is fantastic !  it is so easy to use . 
i have to say that i am very impressed with this case . 
very complete step by step instructions with illustrations right along . 
i have not found that a limit however ,  just a suggestion . 
i pushed my farberware to the back of the cabinets for years . 
for many things this works better than my blender . 
the first time i used it i sprayed it with cooking spray . 
it heats up quickly and i ve had no trouble . 
charges pretty quickly itself then bring unit and any usb cords you need . 
great concept but finger holes seriosly too small . 
i recently purchased this item and absolutely love it . 
trying to use a knife with soft cheeses with a knife equally unsuccessful . 
i use the num_num liters for brown sugar ,  grains ,  pasta . 
so it seems like a good idea to keep extra filters on hand . 
this creates a lot of juices in the pan . 
and it won t make a nice hollandaise or boiled custard . 
a fine grinder indeed and still the one i d chose to purchase . 
the battery life is very good if your not burning too many apps . 
this great little one cupper is just perfect for my needs . 
i was surprised how accurate % the speech recognition was . 
it fit just fine into my phone and it seems pretty sturdy . 
this funnel set is sturdy and having two sizes is convenient . 
is it an improvement or just another option ?  my answer . 
so i bought two or three at a very good price . 
the bluetooth speaker function also works quite well in the car while driving . 
large jobs go to the kitchenaid stand mixer . 
this is the second krups i have purchased and am happy with both . 
the matte finish prevents glare and protects the screen from scratches . 
it would have taken twice as long in the oven . 
if you buy these from amazon ,  you have to pay for shipping . 
decided to buy a good toaster and this one did not disapoint me . 
these make baking uniform size cookies a breeze !  . 
just ordered one similar to it for my new blackberry phone . 
i ve had this bluetooth literally for years now . 
i love the fact that it s a blast from the past . 
a little pricey ,  but if it lasts it will be worth it . 
am purging others from my cabinet because i will not use them anymore . 
i can throw it in the dishwasher for sterilizing . 
it s the first pan i reach for for almost any application . 
i have had no problems with this screen protector since i got it . 
italian ground is much smaller than american ground . 
ok :  it s expensive ,  good looking ,  very ,  very sharp . 
i use these at least once a day . 
the volume buttons are rather small ,  but you get used to them . 
this is a must have in any kitchen . 
i have a great food processor that will not do cheese like mozzarella . 
doesn t let the phone fall over and is very sturdy . 
i have had this cover for about three weeks now . 
there is nothing with this case that warrants any complaining . 
a use full item that will be an asset to my tool collection . 
i have num_num kids and have cooked dinner in it several times . 
i use them for my cake decirating class . 
if green is your favorite color then this case will set it off . 
steak num_extend edit :  cooked a hamburger steak about a half inch thick . 
this is because the mortar is authentic and ground to shape . 
i like this feature ,  but only a little . 
italian brand coffee is a must; lavazza ,  illy ,  are my favorites . 
this will really help it cook to the perfect consistancy . 
i came upon this beauty on one of my shopping sessions on amazon . 
really cheap and easy to use screen protectors to have laying around . 
easy to clean and stores away with ease . 
when recording video or taking pictures it s like a mini tripod . 
my fruit into jam and works great highly recommend . 
the reason is that my droid x gets too hot . 
i guess i could describe it as grippy . 
i would give this five stars !  good price and good protection . 
wood is very good quality ash ,  not junk . 
off to amazon to shop for a new one . 
we also like that it has temp settings . 
my cell phone comes with a micro usb plug for charging and syncing . 
you may even get some beneficial iron in your diet ! reccomended . 
bought a used samsung galaxy num_extend with a cracked screen . 
the oxo good grips julienne peeler is a great gadget . 
works as good as the oem apple bumpers . 
it evenly browned num_num chicken thighs at one time . 
i ll never go back to aluminum pans again . 
the end result is a very hot and satisfying cappuccino . 
i also wanted a quality product that wouldn t decimate my bank account . 
the noise is not that big of deal really . 
the num_extend is a great example of this . 
i love this knife so much ,  i ordered a whole set . 
these days ,  there are a lot of car chargers on the market . 
nice weight ,  feels good in the hand and easy to clean up . 
i wish to have a home in which i can experience num_extend
this closure uses the rotating tabs to lock the bag shut . 
it really is ,  however i really only need one bowl like this . 
this is a reasonable price from amazon for the brita filters . 
a terrific organizational tool particularly when space is limited . 
i def want to get more for tea cupboard and baking goods . 
i have made dozens batches in mine and i love it . 
i hope that it will hold heat like the original did . 
i also like that the charger can autosense the polarity of the battery . 
this is a usefull little device wish i found it sooner . 
not a biggie as the camera sucks anyway . 
this allows me to swap my phone to a fresh battery later . 
they fit perfect and i can see everything that is in them quickly . 
the handles are great for opening jars too . 
take out your manual and remember how to attach it . 
the tablet is in a protective case and gets minimal damage . 
so i filled out a return form and planned on returning it . 
just in time for christmas baking ,  nice sturdy scoop . 
is it a future button ?  or past ?  silly and confusing . 
my hearing tests  perfect;  my wife s does not . 
they all seem to work about the same . 
the cast iron must be heated slowly to prevent distortion and cracking . 
i bought num_num of these ,  one for each car . 
using my regular blender was avoided often due to cleaning chores . 
you can t even tell this is on the screen once afixed . 
i use a soft brush to clean it  don t use anything abrasive  . 
bought this to use with my grey salt ,  that s still moist . 
i purchase this grill due to the high reviews . 
this num_extend whisk is well made  .  . with a very nice handle . 
this however ,  is perfect for just a few cups . 
the same charger that came with the phone . 
then sauteed the meat in the le creuset casserole . 
well made ,  strong and good fit and function ,  covers most plates . 
that s the only reason it didn t get num_num stars . 
glad i can use my iphone in its case . 
it s not the end of the world ,  really . 
for our first time canning we had a great experience with this set . 
i disagree with some of these reviews at least the negative review . 
i think it charges quicker than my previous generic car charger ,  too . 
if you like to save corks this is perfect . 
i like having the led readout for temperature . 
hopefully it lasts me the next num_num or so years !  . 
delivery was quick and the items were securely packaged . 
buy it  ,  buy it buy  ,  it ,  you wont be sorry . 
we have an older but still functioning hoover vacuum cleaner . 
quickly and easily makes perfect popcorn every time . 
the bad news is ,  that the outer body also gets burning hot . 
i ordered these for my wife as she has her first iphone num_extend
that said ,  the replacement filters can be a challenge to find . 
finally broke down and spent the money on this . 
if you want more info ,  search wikipedia for  trrs connector  . 
i hope this helps others improve their coffee experience !  . 
now i ll have one on hand any time i need it . 
for most of my life i have cooked for the multitudes . 
the price of the capresso was a bit steep ,  especially on line . 
but this is a down grade from the previous version . 
i got to the app for netflix and started to watch a movie . 
it is large enough to hold two standard size sponges or scrubbers . 
although we followed the directions to a t ,  it stopped working . 
the thing still chirps  battery life high  whenever i turn it on . 
this is not junk or does the turbo sprayer stop working . 
i have ordered this ,  which you can get from amazon . 
i have dropped the cellphone a few times aready and nothing happened . 
the weight is comfortable and the shape is stable on my gas cooktop . 
try and be very conservative measuring the sink because of the slope . 
has enough power to almost provide num_num phone charges . 
and was able to try it after giving it . 
we have owned and used two of these large grills by presto . 
four and a half stars for this one . 
i have no idea how i can sharpen it by myself . 
she loves it and uses it every day . 
it fits like a glove and the color is great . 
we now consider this feature a wash out . 
the only con is that it doesn t sharpen scissors . 
when the terminals touch the battery contacts you get a red light . 
is it a whole lot faster ,  easier and cheaper ?  yep . 
i m making a lot more tea and drinking less soda . 
the product works well and might be just what you need as well . 
the pouring shield works great ,  as does most kitchenaid products . 
the original back is kind of a pain to remove . 
it s all stainless steel even the springs and gears . 
i got one like this num_num years ago . 
it clamps it perfectly for my bike rides . 
since my friends and family always comment on how nice my collection is . 
i have been using my popcorn popper for about a week now . 
it s the only one i ve found that will fit . 
with this sharpener ,  the knife became sharp again . 
i would recommend this product to anyone wanting a good knife sharpener . 
bought one for my fil as he found it so fun to use . 
i ordered this on a wednesday and had it on friday . 
i bought num_num of these to make mini donuts with . 
it functions the same as when i purchased it ,  flawlessly . 
a nicer lanyard can be purchased separately if required . 
strange how something as minor as a stopper becomes so important . 
no more cracked eggs or eggs with the insides oozing out . 
the jabra is nothing to sneeze at either ,  btw . 
it took a good beating and always bounced back . 
this device is easy to use and really does gauge the temperature well . 
i returned it immediately and received a replacement . 
well made and a great value at the price . 
you pull out just a bit of bag and make a seal . 
the handles do stay cool ,  though i can t imagine how . 
using the handle it is easy to lift with one hand . 
its easy to clean and surprisingly sturdy and thin . 
the only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level . 
i can whisk anything at a high power . 
warning :  these headphones will make you look like a tech dork . 
the only thing i dislike is the color . 
hard or soft this one slices them all . 
the exterior and interior enamel coating is very durable and easy to clean . 
my phone fits very well and the velcro is heavy duty . 
you might have to put it in the garage . 
for my purpose the cord lenght is just right . 
it makes them as crisp as you like . 
very strong with just enough flex to scrap out corners . 
don t know how i got threw life without this product . 
they are very cute and will enjoy using them . 
these scoops are great for a lot of little things in the kitchen . 
i was surprised at the quality of this product . 
small pieces of fish and meat cooked well in the basket . 
i wish we had gotten them sooner ,  though . 
i will continue to use this product and will recommend it to others . 
super easy to use ,  a breeze to clean . 
the furniture nozzle water cools too fast in the hose . 
and those you call have no idea you are using a headset . 
it s very easy to hand chop a small amount of food . 
i tried it and all descriptions fullfil expectations . 
it reliably keeps the cake from sticking and tearing . 
i read that heat destroys the valuable compounds . 
ordered this case after getting an extended battery for my evo . 
this took all of five minutes to install in my xt panel . 
soak in cold water while your oven is preheating and while you prep . 
one less dish to wash is always a great thing . 
this is a quality product from a known company . 
 the male end of whatever cig outlets going into this thing  . 
overall the item is really portableand the design is very slick . 
this helps your food stay warm while serving . 
they are not available on the jabra site or on any other site . 
one of my favorite apps is the skyfire browser . 
when it arrived ,  it had everything needed and activation was extremely easy . 
the removable heating rack on the top of the toaster is stainless steel . 
they are fit and good for broiling or grill . 
make sure to clean it regularly ,  say ,  every num_num months . 
the stoneware shattered into many pieces and shards . 
crusts turn out perfect ,  crusty outside ,  chewy inside . 
i prefer these over the smaller bags ,  as anything will fit inside . 
i now look like a tv chef chopping without mishap . 
i bought this on a friday sale for $
it is solid ,  simple and easy to use . 
when i was purchasing it my husband said he wanted one also . 
does anything last more than a year or num_num anymore ?  . 
i use these for everything in the kitchen . 
our next meal attempt will be suckling pig and couscous . 
i had been looking for quality pans for some time . 
it handles even whole wheat breads without causing a burden on the motor . 
it came on time and we had no problems . 
i have a large family and we love cheesecake . 
the wine tasted awesome !  same flavor profile with even more rounded tannins . 
it has made hundreds of cups of coffee . 
i make lots of waffles and freeze them for later use . 
i am currently using it to run input into a sound system . 
one tiny drop of super glue makes it perfect . 
it takes standard size loaves ,  not wide pieces . 
i do wish the wide end were a bit wider . 
you can t beat this many for the price . 
i don t have any issues with the pressing of buttons ,  etc . 
i got my pot which is made in china for $
it really doesn t fit under my espresso machine well . 
we ve been taking our chambord camping for quite a few years . 
if i listen at the nozel i can hear the leak . 
i had one and purchased this for my daughter . 
the glasses are very heavy and are well made . 
mine came in bulk packaging ,  so there were no instructions . 
the good weight and thick bottom allows even heat distribution . 
if i needed a shaker ,  i would purchase this one . 
nice case ,  doesn t add to much bulk to the phone . 
 a watched pot never boils  a unwatched pot can boil away . 
the cover comes off easily ,  and it looks nice . 
personally ,  i almost never hold my cell phone up to my ear . 
so i finally broke down and replaced the beater attachment . 
i laughed at first and then fell in love . 
love this product ,  its affordable and it charges my phone really quick . 
i m now loving this paring knife in particular . 
the drinkmaster is simple to use and to clean up . 
the door stays closed and so far the bread has not gotten moldy . 
we would recommend it to anyone looking for an electric knife . 
if not for this ,  it would be num_num stars plus . 
no boilerplate text messages  like palm centro or num_extend
 vs the papertowel method i was using before  . 
and this it does with ease and the burgers tasted great . 
do not waste your money on the oxo julienne peeler . 
i purchased this electric skillet to use in our motor home . 
so easy ,  even the kids can use it . 
my mom just got one too and she likes it as well . 
i had to search amazon to find one like we want . 
it pairs up in seconds to my iphone . 
i can remove the opener and store it if not in use . 
after charging it all i had to do was turn it on . 
i purchased these muffin rings primarily to make gluten free hamburger buns . 
over my lifetime i have had three other garlic presses before this one . 
i don t have to worry about my battery running low any more . 
this was my experience with the motorola atrix . 
it is easy to use as well as easy to clean up . 
its a nice little addition we can all enjoy . 
it has all the characteristics of the high end knife . 
i end up with perfect meat every time that way . 
bento and investing in rolls of foil and sturdy lunchbags . 
they are expensive no matter where you get them . 
we can t extrapolate from this but intuition still works . 
i bought this screen protector for my iphone num_extend from num_extend
very easy to hear the person on the other line . 
i have to chuckle a little when i write this review . 
i was fortunate enough to purchase two on a friday sale . 
and great to protect the phone as well from most anything . 
does the job that we though and is the perfect size . 
ive installed many of these and its pretty simple . 
i found the directions very easy to understand . 
these have not let me down so far . 
however ,  the screen guard provides a visual barrier that is quite noticeable . 
these can replace almost anything that usually needs foil or parchment . 
purple color online is representative of the actual color case you will receive . 
then i bought another two for gifts and more for me . 
i decided to investigate for myself and i am glad that i did . 
my toyota matrix also generates a lot of road and wind noise . 
the grill pan easily snaps into the plastic housing . 
i kept my plasticboard longer than i wanted to until i found these . 
also ,  some have complained of the coil  rusting .   nonsense . 
i love to bake and my friend suggested this when making little tarts . 
it is quiet ,  very powerful and a substantial piece of construction . 
i just wanted to leave my experience for use with the num_extend
never thought i d own one ,  but this one just amazed me . 
use this every day at work !  it does the job well . 
i bought them from   .  .  .   and they re great as well . 
comfortable to wear and build quality seems high . 
i love it !  !  the best i have every owned . 
like a low whine i guess you would call it . 
 if you discover this you unplug it and wait num_num min . 
if you just toss it in a drawer  vs . 
needless to say ,  my fingerprints did not show up on either case . 
pops almost all the corn and is easy to clean . 
i can get it off the lid but not apart from the chute . 
it does smell somehow weird  as somebody mentioned earlier  . 
other than that ,  we really like this case . 
this is the nicest little steamer i can imagine . 
it is bulky but not overly bulky add to be annoying . 
we tried this machine and it really took care of business . 
it is a great value and has a nice long cord . 
keep pans handy and apart from each other . 
not a scratch and the phone works perfect . 
i just find it a blast to use . 
it held on but if dropped it immediately went apart . 
it s on the lower right corner of the front cover . 
this caused a loss of num_num star ,  otherwise still a great headset . 
but it weigh a ton ,  is durable and works great and fast . 
i ve used it twice and it worked both times . 
i m giving it num_num stars because the container could be little bigger . 
i have used both the duet and quartet for years . 
updatein conclusion ,  we would repurchase our zoji despite its shortcomings . 
it s big ,  heavy ,  and holds some serious heat . 
have your stuff prepared before juicing will save a headache . 
i came across the amazon case and thought what the heck . 
unlike others that advertise num_extend this actually gives the pi the amperage needed . 
as the food is cooked ,  steam is emitted . 
nothing bad to say !  they are tiny as the name implies . 
we received our starter set as a wedding gift . 
i am planning on buying more brita products in the coming months . 
a minor problem but worth mentioning none the less . 
i ended up getting a cupholder mount instead . 
the decorations always fell until i get these suction hooks . 
i think this was a good purchase and am happy with the price . 
it closes tightly enough that the tea leaves don t leak out . 
i replaced the original battery with this one and what a difference . 
easy to use just lay phone on it and it charges . 
but ,  once in ,  you can t get the insets out . 
i actually make my juice hour as a ritual . 
i have bought these protectors before and they do a really nice job . 
this case fits my htc inspire num_extend perfectly . 
am very glad i got this with the kitchenaid system that i purchased . 
this is a good blender ,  but that coupler is an issue . 
i ve read some reviews of it not working with some blackberries . 
these are of the same quality that were original to the sweeper . 
the result is something light and perfect and practically fool proof . 
the best thing i ve gotten for the kitchen in a while . 
i use this in a room that is about num_extend
it took num_num minutes and num_num seconds to cook the popcorn without oil . 
my motorola bluetooth headset finally died after long use at the gym . 
never leaks ,  never gets stuck ,  dishwasher safe ,  and extremely sturdy . 
once you get the hang of it ,  this works super well . 
micro usb spiral cable is well designed within the body . 
this makes it harder to put my thumb on the home button . 
we were always loosing ends over the years . 
but the artisan isn t a bad choice either . 
good for the price you cant beat it . 
came quickly  overnight  as it was needed  quickly  for gifting . 
these shun are the sharpest that i have ever used . 
stated that this headset is intended for use only with android . 
it actually is an everyday pan in our house . 
ive read enough to know this healthier than just about everything else . 
the price could be a little bit better . 
it was a gift for my daughter ,  and she loves it . 
these hold up great ,  even in the dishwasher . 
this worked quite well and did exactly as promised . 
it all started with my palm pilot years ago ,  which i loved . 
obviously it is best for pizza ,  but i have numerous other foods . 
it don t lose suction at all ,  and is very versatile . 
i have been working with this thing for about num_num minutes . 
very pleased and they look great on the counter . 
a good bronze color and is a heavy metal . 
i love to bake and this is such an amazing thing to have . 
unfortunately because the lids are plastic ,  they retain odors . 
this will slip into some belt clip holsters too . 
i have used different pans and this is the only one i like . 
i ve had corning ware for years and it s very reliable . 
it s a safe way of slicing bagels with little effort . 
don t have tangled wires in my pocket now . 
this keeps your tea hot ,  for a very ,  very long time . 
my phone is still in one piece after over a year . 
this is the best case for those who take care of their phone . 
the grind setting is done by rotating the bean holder . 
this boils fast ,  it s compact and it s easy to clean . 
if it is hard to turn ,  loosen before trying to grind anything . 
lots of uses in the kitchen ,  pantry and craft room . 
it works just as well as a wall charger . 
it also includes a option to feed sound to your aux input . 
i bought this just for back up purpose . 
i feel like a real chef when i grill with these things . 
this is a very nice rubber protector for my sons iphone . 
it is still charging even with this little problem . 
while the sound is clear and sharp it is very very very faint . 
it does not garble up the bottom of my cookies . 
it has a wonderful flexibility ,  too , which is better than rigid . 
i bought this one for my motorola razr . 
callers do hear the background noise ,  of course . 
instead ,  just tap the phone button and voila ,  voice control . 
so it s like getting num_num for the price of one . 
for the price ,  it is a good deal ,  nevertheless . 
this is one handy machine for greting up small spots and stains . 
we love the size of it and the side slot for the tongs . 
the best thing about these headphones are they fit my head . 
the case is sturdy ,  the color is beautiful . 
these caps are great if you have wide mouth jars around . 
we have used our nissan daily for two years now . 
well packaged and looks like a quality item . 
actually so pretty that i haven t used them yet . 
as with any pressure cooker be careful with moving it !  . 
what else can i write ,  it s a tub . 
all of these small objects nowadays are manufactured in china anyways . 
these look really nice on my white stove . 
so ,  it should not be an issue with it scratching the screen . 
it really feels indulgent to eat so much . 
i read all the reviews for many slicers . 
a wonderful bowl to use as a table centerpiece . 
can go straight from the stove top into oven . 
it s not a knock off or an imitation . 
this is the only ice bucket we will need . 
if u need a good thermomter ,  look no further  !  . 
i can t say enough nice things about this device . 
but ,  after the first batch ,  i was an ole pro . 
just one caution ,  do not add additional salt . 
the purple version is very bright and my wife really likes it . 
usually if i adjust it a little ,  it gets better . 
works great just like the ones they sell for num_extend
now my brother can lose weight and listen to music . 
i always wash and dry this by hand . 
chop and dice your way through fresh vegetables easily . 
the thick walls are great for retaining heat . 
it is easy to use and tenderizes the meat . 
you get what you pay for and this is worth the price . 
its always good to have a spare anyways . 
being able to attached to the headphone jack is very handy also . 
fairly easy to clean ,  but does need some elbow grease . 
i wish other companies had a similar idea for batteries . 
good screen protector ,  great price and fat dependable shipping . 
and last about as long as they always have . 
i always put mine to cool on a rack . 
will be watching to see hos long it maintains its sharpness . 
this is the second one i have purchased . 
this keeps them from burning and smoking in the hotter oven . 
within minutes you ll have num_num cups of fluffy popcorn . 
of course this is num_num minutes for the whole year . 
i purchased for a friend of mine and she loved it . 
great and speedy customer care to make up for a mistake . 
that movement made a loud noise in addition to the motor . 
will fit in the palm of your hand and your drawer quite nicely . 
i bought this juicer after my num_num year old waring finally wore out . 
i have an oxo and it has lasted for many many years . 
small ,  fast ,  and easy to charge your phone . 
i can also answer the phone more easily . 
my husband rarely drinks coffee ,  so one cup is perfect . 
when you skype call on phone ,  it drains battery . 
the flange lands solidly on the bottle lip without any spreading . 
this product is very good and fits on the phone nicely . 
this handle has prongs that stick in this shaft . 
and then my cousin told me she has one too . 
i just wanted something to keep the scratches off the back . 
they retain virtually no odor  what little odor is in the gasket  . 
but then i manned up and took a peek at my phone . 
the only thing i regret ,  is that the handle is quite short . 
very nice strainer that s hard to find in stores . 
does the job of keeping my iphone protected . 
sadly ,  i ll have to keep my plastic one . 
it has exceptional sharpness and is a pleasure to use . 
now just waiting on how long it will take before it falls apart . 
if you purchase drinks on the go this cup is for you . 
however ,  the company is terrible to do business with . 
first ,  the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily . 
other than that ,  this is a charger that i recommend . 
one other problem is that the measurements are a little hard to read . 
i miss it and would like to buy another one . 
i bought the medium size and absolutely love it . 
i have already used this a few time and love it . 
just received this table cloth and am so impressed with the quality . 
i am very happy with the sound from this headset . 
this popper does an adequate job without burning the kernels . 
i was very pleased with the package contents and the quality and value . 
it makes knives as sharp as razor blades . 
i love this food processor because it is a smaller size . 
i wish it had been a couple of inches smaller . 
it s very simple to use and seals great . 
thrilled when i found this one ,  at a reasonable price . 
i have virtually standardized on these screen protector . 
bought this case because ,  i needed it obviously . 
i have two of this exact buckets now . 
you can t talk and charge at the same time . 
blenders are great ,  but they re a pain to clean !  . 
then again ,  the metal construction may survive that . 
have to get the ingredients for potato pancakes . 
lightweight ,  portable ,  simple to inflate ,  very high quality . 
also the wires come off for easier cleaning and efficient storage . 
ironically ,  the speakers on the competing num_extend phones are similarly mediocre . 
product was as described and arrived very quickly . 
the whey is way full of protein and other good stuff . 
the ones in the picture must only be the small bunches . 
this makes fantastic coffee and is a stunning piece in itself . 
this little shelf is great under my bathroom and kitchen sink . 
had a lot of fun with this cookie cutter making christmas cookies . 
i make a lot of broths and gravies . 
on the stiff side ,  but they do the job just fine . 
all in all ,  we re still very happy with this purchase . 
they don t put it in a shipping box . 
there is another brand that leaves that part exposed if you prefer that . 
it will not pop off your belt !  which is what you want . 
this product is worth every dollar you pay . 
i replaced my cheap plastic measuring cup with this pyrex version . 
i bake savory and sweet things in i . 
it heats up fast and the temperature seems accurate . 
this beats the heck out of the dyson for ease of use . 
the are a great deal and great price . 
i bought this for my iphone num_extend and im pretty pleased with it . 
bottom line is this waffle maker turns out great tasting ,  fluffy waffles . 
but i have been very happy with it . 
functions fast just like i need it to . 
it still sounds decent ,  just not as good . 
it is well priced ,  very convenient ,  and it works as advertised . 
so far ,  it s holding up very well ,  very stable . 
what can i say other than it works well like any hepa filter . 
a reasonable solution for small spaces in a small car . 
i can put an entire meal into this steamer . 
i am sure i need to hide this from my son . 
i sent a set to my mother also . 
the volume and fitment of this num_num are much better than on the num_extend
it was for my dad and he loves it . 
after reading reviews i decided to give this one a go . 
but what a great flavor cooking in it . 
also haven t been able decipher the george grille model list yet . 
we are a busy family with three teens and full time jobs . 
this is a good company with good products . 
a piece of frozen fruit broke the motor . 
i own several sizes of these storage bowls and love them . 
i have had these knives for num_num days and i really love them . 
much better than single cup heated in microwave . 
i have to take the headset off to access the switch . 
so far have no bad reviews with this brand . 
easily paired to my iphone ,  and has great sound quality . 
but will try ordering another one in case this one was just defective . 
easy to operate and move with the attached handle . 
when i accidentally found this one i gave it a try . 
the ear buds can easily fall of since they are interchangeable . 
i estimate num_num to num_num full charges for the phone . 
so i stuck with this defective product for about a year now . 
these dishes were a hit in all three instances . 
you plug it in ,  the red light comes on to preheat . 
it also gave me a serving bowl that i enjoy very much . 
you can not turn on music with the sena . 
having a charger in the car is a great back up . 
the machine then does the rest and does it magmificiently . 
adds a professional well organized look to the kitchen drawer . 
although this is an amazing device ,  i did have a few problems . 
the only thing that i d like to have differently is the color . 
a word of warning :  wash immediately after use . 
i bought the num_num cup and i m glad i did . 
it feels good while holding it ,  and looks even better . 
it s perfectly weighted and feels great resting in your hand . 
this lead me to the waring commercial website . 
the stripes on the sides make it easier to hold onto . 
this mount allows you to place the iphone num_num easily with one hand . 
i am satisfied with this case so far . 
they have a flat finish which looks fine in my truck . 
i have a cold natured dog who shivers if it is below num_extend
i ended up with % remaining before i called it a night . 
this is the original and simply the best . 
i could not do without one of these in my kitchen . 
this product works great !  glad i got it . 
fit well and look sharp !  but thwy dont last very long . 
it goes on easily enough and adheres very well to the screen . 
removable tray for dropping the crumbs in the garbage . 
the selection of the shapes gives a lot of variety for uses . 
these spoons are used almost every day in my kitchen . 
the secret is in the powercup ,  which makes this work so efficiently . 
so buyer beware ,  but this is a good one . 
once it is on the pot ,  it is very easy to operate . 
cooks illustrated gave this pan great reviews and it is rock solid . 
it is quite attractive in its stainless steel construction . 
it also pops the inexpensive popcorn very well . 
also its pretty sturdy and not overly heavy . 
this is the best case i have purchased so far . 
use pam or a baking spray with flour on it . 
i have given these to friends and they love them . 
this was a gift to my grand daughter just for fun . 
one  trick  with a le creuset and this one would benefit from . 
it took me about fifteen minuets to assemble . 
i bought this case to replace the same one that i cracked . 
they are an excellent buy and i recommend . 
others have ably covered the phone s technical specs . 
this clothers hamper on wheels was just what i was looking for . 
i have pet birds ,  and i used to let them breed sometimes . 
looks like this cable is going to get quite a workout . 
the seller was great ,  but this product is junk . 
unfortunately for me ,  my stereo does not support the flipsynk . 
but they work great and are the perfect size !  . 
i bought one for all our family members . 
its beautiful and colorful and grand daughter loved it . 
my main concern is that the wire is thinner than the oem version . 
the tray is very attactive and carries the henckels reputation for quality . 
he ditched his other headphones the moment these arrived . 
fantastic pans ,  they are heavy ,  but they crisp cookies fantastically . 
we use this for everything from soup to cornbread to veggies . 
have our litter box in the laundry room which has a tile floor . 
the case fit well and has stayed well . 
this installs easy and work very well in rural areas . 
anyway does not interfere with look or feel and seems durable so far . 
this skillet seems to be working great so far . 
there is practically no waste ,  and the tines never touch the blades . 
it fits neatly and snugly over the phone and protects it well . 
i purchased this rice cooker about a month ago . 
this rice cooker is our favorite thing in the kitchen . 
and keep it hot while you write a review for amazon . 
i might add that i have just ordered a bodum cast iron wok . 
i have bought a few of these sets for myself and as gifts . 
this product is as advertised and works very well . 
it blows nicely on my face in all num_num settings . 
i am able to clip anything i want to the fridge . 
this is not a problem at all with this waffle maker . 
however ,  these are very minor issues that can easily be be remedied . 
his room gets hot in the afternoon sun . 
what i received was not what was in the picture . 
its a very well made little round slow cooker . 
i would recommend this mirro food press to everyone that likes to can . 
i mainly use this to bloom yeast or stir up waffle batter . 
i needed a mesh strainer when i make coconut and hemp milks . 
this unit is classy looking and feels solid . 
i wish i knew this ,  i would have purchased the small scoop . 
for now ,  i will still give it a num_num star . 
all the buttons and ports are still easily accessible . 
if you use a lot of juice ,  upgrade to this product . 
so i bought one and tried it out . 
but it s not too hard to pop out when answering calls . 
i have been looking for something like this to make quick salads . 
that held well but then the plastic lining on the sides ripped . 
my older num_num quart copper core saucier weighs num_extend ounces . 
the manufacturer suggests avoiding citrus dishwashing products so i do . 
i have skinomi on my htc evo num_extend hp touchpad , and iphone num_extend
i did not use any of the straight hooks . 
naturally ,  there was some soiling of the carpet on moving day . 
this lodge cast iron pizza pan is the best . 
the wall charger is slow ,  but it works great overnight . 
easy cleanup in dishwasher and easy to store . 
not sure what the last person was talking about ,  i was worried . 
unfortunately ,  my assembly experience was less than stellar . 
this is stylish and gives her a sence of security . 
i think to release the item from the mold it is made in . 
this case is probably my favorite otterbox i ve ever purchased . 
takes some time to get use to turning it on and off . 
i bought this because the one i had got destroyed . 
i get that they are better for the spice containers though . 
i ve own a lot of these over the past two decades !  . 
i use it with my pink one and it looks awesome . 
it sounded better than the aux input on our factory radio . 
it comes with excellent instructions and is very easy to use . 
i find it comfortable enough that i forget i m even wearing it . 
i paid $ and it worth every penny . 
it is what it is ,  not too much to comment about here . 
very sharp ,  gets the job done in short order . 
this was such a good case for the price . 
i did a measured charge in the car this morning . 
i bought one for my brother and three friends . 
i need my num_num hands for my computer while speaking . 
it was extra easy to clean and stands up so it saves space . 
i did allow for a num_num hour  set  period . 
it cleans easily as well ,  which is the icing on the cake . 
used every single day ,  and still looks almost brand new . 
beeps when heated and beeps again when done cooking . 
it makes me happy everytime i turn it over . 
no matter ,  because i really like this little guy . 
seems very solid and ithink it will last . 
it is actually made better than i expected . 
i ve only had this a couple days but so far so good . 
they re really meant for a one time use . 
the paper towel over the dish prevented all spattering . 
i bought the whirley pop on a whim . 
needed extra storage space in the kitchen ,  utility closet and garage . 
when i found this case for under $ my dreams were answered . 
i have used this hundreds of times and it still works great . 
it is hard to pair with this item . 
all knives are remain sharp and they have a nice heft to them . 
for the money ,  $ this coffee maker would be hard to beat . 
the cell reception as a phone is excellent in our area . 
if you stack pans ,  separate with paper plates . 
my phone fits snugly and feels very well protected . 
even though it gives minimal coverage it does give great edge protection . 
i bought this for my daughter mainly for her coffee beans . 
i am impressed with this knife and recommend it highly . 
it works great and cleans up pretty easily . 
i would not had mined the different color if it would fit . 
we re going to get more ,  forget all that plastic crap . 
this pastry blender works great and is of good quality . 
my wife uses it for baking bread and likes it . 
charges just like the oem one i got for my galaxy sii . 
great set of spoons !  well worth the price . 
it s a very nice quality and a nice weight . 
this pot is perfect for making chinese hot pot dinners . 
this is a beautiful and decorative addition to any kitchen . 
they wash up well and are nice and large . 
remember to adjust and experiment for your microwave oven . 
what a great buy !  i use this to grind spices and herbs . 
i purchased this to make cheesecake in my pressure cooker . 
i would call this the cadillac set of measuring cups . 
this grinder is a great combination of reasonable price and good performance . 
the sound is still great  on both ends  . 
i haven t used them yet but really looking forward to the experience . 
over the years i ve owned several traditional wooden coat racks . 
hdmi ,  finger scanner ,  sd card slot ,  num_extend dual core . 
and ,  pretty much nothing sticks to it ,  either . 
dule usb ports so i can also plug in a second device . 
so i finally gave up and made one . 
love not having paid crazy amount to fix my phone . 
also ,  parts are readily availble which is important . 
it can grind course to very fine coffee . 
but it could have been designed with more intelligent features in mind . 
we are excite to have another night like this . 
the cheese was nicely melted but not dried out . 
i realized that it was because i was holding it horizontally . 
this is a sturdy grater and the grater holes are small . 
it will last all day if you use it intermittently . 
i don t really consider it to be loud . 
i live in a strange area for recption . 
as you pour ,  wine comes out from under the  seal  . 
i wish all my small appliances worked this well . 
when the cuisinart finally died ,  we were quite ready for a change . 
i also like the handle ,  which has a very comfortable grip . 
i have no other hesitation in recommending it . 
the great thing is that it works great . 
i does everything that a case of it s type suppose to do . 
it gets used several times a month for that and for drying fruit . 
other than that it works perfectly and has a great feel . 
the build quality seems very good and the price is certainly right . 
the drawback is the separate  power cup  inserts . 
the slits in the case seem to work just fine however . 
i love the sleekness and color of the case . 
last year i bought this knife and loved it . 
i ve got plenty of room for sauted vegatables . 
when you lay the phone horizontally ,  it s much more stable . 
they are well constructed and will turn off immediately if tilted . 
it s lightweight so even filled it s easy to move . 
for less than $ this is a steal . 
my hat is off to the people who made it . 
the phone comes out of the case easily . 
i have hated each and every bluetooth i ve ever owned . 
crisp clear sound and security over the ear . 
the design is much more comfortable that i expected . 
i ve had this garlic crusher for over a year now . 
but again ,  this is strictly a matter of personal preference . 
simple product that is great for my desk at work . 
it is not necessarily the best choice for kitchen jobs . 
highly recommended if you have a creme charger . 
this was highly recommended by the folks at america s test kitchen . 
but ,  i didn t pay just for the cutter . 
this item was good ,  i was definitely happy with this particular purchase . 
the sparkles only flake off a little bit . 
now ,  i feel i could have gone with the single one . 
take care of it and it will do its job . 
just make sure it has the metal insides . 
i purchased one of these in spite of the reviews below . 
apple doesn t certify anything that uses the female num_num pin connector . 
for the money ,  this set is hard to beat . 
so later on i ll get that one ,  too . 
more than this and my ears actually ache . 
the protector works nice on the sun light . 
it uses less electricity than baseboard heaters ,  so it saves money . 
we bought this one to replace and older one . 
has great battery life ,  fits well ,  and works great . 
i bought this to mount my iphone to my bike when i ride . 
fits medium size cups perfectly  not for mugs  . 
i use this on any stove top and it cooks great . 
got this to charge my verizon wifi talk thing . 
i did call kitchenaid to get the correct model number . 
i selected the stainless steel model because it is rust and stain resistant . 
i got got around num_num hours from these . 
it works great and is very easy to set up . 
this pan is a perfect size for family camping trips . 
this is the single best bluetooth handset i ve used . 
suck it up and pay the money ,  you llenjoy it . 
i keep it set up on my refrigerator at his height . 
for the price ,  it s absolutely worth the purchase . 
you will not be disappointed with this purchase . 
i must confess that i did not purchase it as drinkware . 
then cuisinart added a glass top to make the eating experience even better . 
and never needed the suction cup since the screen was shattered . 
the machine seemed to be working too hard . 
we were all surprised and quite pleased with how the roomba works . 
you can squeeze it quite dry with this . 
the color is great ,  and the case is durable . 
it shipped fast and came package in great condition . 
it went together well and it looks adorable ,  great price too !  . 
don t see any solution to that other than to pay attention . 
my only complaint is it is not big enough . 
no more soggy salads . no more watered down dressings . 
very classy and makes you smile in the morning . 
this is the dualit  light  which is the buget toaster . 
i do not microwave it the second or third time . 
too bad dyson won t make an adapter for it . 
wow !  it works so very ,  very well for that . 
it does not affect the way the case protects the phone . 
we highly recommend this product to anyone considering purchasing it . 
not as heavy as some makes it easier to handle . 
does what i needed it to do in a small space . 
it s great in skillets but also works well on my grill . 
gives me very good battery life im happy with this product . 
the warning in the manual is not adequate . 
this little device has saved my life many times . 
one thing i really enjoy making is pizza . 
for the price it is a great value . 
i ll post a review update in num_num months . 
yes ,  i would recommend this to a friend . 
frees up table space and holds plenty of plastic cutlery . 
this grinder does a very good job for a competitive price . 
i think motorola keeps it simple and the price is good . 
i bought a packet of these for me and my sisters . 
enough that you do notice that they are there . 
these will be used for the two lower screws  into wall studs  . 
it is easy to clean and provides great quality juice . 
i used to have one of these and it died . 
i agree with most of the positive reviews about this product . 
i like my new set of corelle livingware . 
stainless steel also means dishwasher safe and no rusting . 
wow !  this is my first french press and is it amazing . 
i use this for my samsung galaxy num_extend and it works just fine . 
sizes were perfect for the odd selection of knives i bought . 
there s not a whole lot to this thing . 
almost everything about this pan was pretty much as expected . 
but i continued and found out that it glides effortlessly over our carpets . 
these have worked perfectly and the price is great !  . 
any screen protector you purchase will have those issues . 
but up it popped in my gold box . 
and forgot that i was wearing my jabra easygo . 
i think it s all about how one would maintain it . 
our old toaster was only num_num years old . 
there nothing any nicer then nice hot pezza just out of the oven . 
heat the pan on the burner until the oil starts to smoke . 
what more could you ask for ?  well ,  maybe a bigger bowl . 
it has its own app built into the phonefor docking only . 
uses less water than commercial grade rental machines . 
seems to be of high quality material and it s well made . 
very heavy duty and american made !  will last your lifetime !  . 
how delicious !  and aroma in the house a side benefit . 
it shuts off after num_num seconds when tipped over or left horizontally . 
they work great as prep or serving bowls . 
it s fine ,  but the alarm is really quiet . 
after reading the reviews ,  i was a little hesitant to get one . 
i would definitely recommend this product to friends ,  family and neighbors . 
left one in mexico when we moved back to the states . 
i ended up purchasing this one over other skins . 
i would recommend this to anyone .  .  .  . thank you amazon . 
these microplane graters are great ,  super sharp ,  convenient ,  etc . 
it s fine for the price for a quick froth . 
this is a great pan for the money . 
note that the filter brands will generally interchange between brands of pitchers . 
i use this one for pasta or sometimes for cookies . 
i m going to order three more for christmas presents . 
purchased these for a gift for a friend . 
used it for the first time today and no problem . 
the holes for the speakers and buttons are cut well . 
i purchased the case to protect my phone and it worked very well . 
i also saw this knife on america s test kitchen . 
there mangnets ,  so i can t really say too much . 
fingerprints wipe right off with the cloth provided . 
i watched the tutorial videos on nordic ware s website . 
this the num_extend time i have bought some . 
i wound up using it more than my htc branded hardshell case . 
we got this to replace an older metal spoon rest . 
my whole family is eating so much healthier . 
there are more options than just butter ,  but we don t . 
this pan is big enough to handle a nice stir fry . 
the cord is long enough and the charger works very wiell . 
it is plenty non stick for my liking . 
i wind up with a large bowl of tasty popcorn . a few num_extend
it s made in the usa so i m not that worried . 
i am using this jar for a terrarium . 
well made ,  very simple design ,  does everything a timer should do . 
the whole thing seems pretty forgiving and they include a measuring cup . 
let the pan heat up before adding the oil . 
thanks to amazon . com ,  our coffee now tastes good again . 
this will require attention in avoiding bumping and hard use . 
i would by gel covers like this again . 
this does exactly what i wanted at a fair price . 
overall i would totally recommend this case to any iphone num_extend owner . 
scales flying everywhere  .  . more cleaning up than cleaning the fish . 
i wish the yellow band was about num_num to num_num inches longer . 
we have multiple apple devices and always seem to have misplaced cables . 
i am so happy i found this replacement on amazon . 
they hold even in the wind !  others have bend or broken . 
it holds the droid x snug and lets me fun with free hands . 
but its good fro price as a backup battery . 
i am able to use these with my kindle fire hd num_num inch . 
i like the way the light reflects through the glass . 
i will be ordering another for my daughter . 
this is my third or fourth juicer i ve bought over the years . 
the sleeve is easily removable for cleaning purposes . 
can never have too many batter cables and chargers . 
compared to more expensive one this is worth the buy . 
this is better for the phone battery and it save additional juice . 
when i moved i lost it so bought another . 
wipe down the base for good measure . highly recommend . 
well it wasn t bought for the charger anyway . 
gave it to my husband to cover his new kitchenaid mixer . 
work great and i needed a car phone charger . 
the leftover coffee was still hot hours later  !  !   and not bitter  . 
it s difficult to find a really good wok spatula in my experience . 
i ve lost one and worn out the replacement . 
i bought them for my mom and she loves them . 
this charger had my phone fully charged within an hour . 
a gorgeous and functional addition to any modern kitchen . 
if you look on youtube there a dozen good videos on sharpening . 
i no longer have the strength in my hands to use other scoops . 
it s compact ,  easy to clean ,  and tears through most anything . 
have a canister that had not been airtight for years . 
this is the best can opener that i have ever owned . 
when placed on the phone it looked awesome with the mirror look like . 
i use them also for leftovers and food prep . 
her pancakes were thin and very much like crepes . 
i give this product five stars because i really liked the color . 
this is the test for all cookware for use with an induction top . 
kind of wonder what happened; one can only infer that it breaks easily . 
so i don t think there s much into those mhl adapters . 
each cup has a brightly colored measurement indicator . 
these are pretty good quality and easy to assemble . 
this has to be done again over time but i don t mind . 
stayed solid after three days in fridge and traveled well . 
love ,  love this black and silver iphone cover . 
and they coordinate with so many other dishes . 
in my opinion callpod should have included this accessory with the callpod chargepod . 
i also think the glass is better for cleanliness . 
i would recommend this product to my friends and family . 
really heavy duty case ,  a bit bulky but it serves its purpose . 
this is impressive because pure ethanol is a solvent . 
my review is much the same as others . 
easy to hold and not too large to comfortably work with the cake . 
follow use and cleaning directions and you will be happy . 
it s easy to clean ,  and no more food color or smell . 
i used it several times and each time loved it more . 
words can not express how i feel about this particular case . 
it is a cinch to clean and assemble . 
makes even the cheapest of knifes seem expensive . 
it has worked well with no complaints or problems . 
being a chef i would recommend this pan for your sauteing needs . 
i admit to have a huge sense of humor . 
i have tried several of them and this one is the best . 
i bought this to use on the stove top of a travel trailer . 
it would be great if it were shorter and wider . 
i m getting a couple more ,  one for a gift . 
that s all i need ,  and that s what it does . 
this is one of the best things about this razr . 
seems to be the exact battery that came with my droid . 
seems well made ,  strong and easy to install . 
the unit seems well made and feels solid . 
not even samsung own bluetooth headphone works well with the galaxy num_extend
this is a high quality set of flatware . 
we really like the little ridge around face . 
they are absolutely beautiful glasses and you can t beat the price . 
much better now that the os upgraded last week . 
if i soak it ,  i don t have any trouble cleaning it . 
the multiple piece connectors are flimsy and easy to loose . 
this morning he turns it on and there is nothing but static . 
it works perfectly for how we drink coffee . 
they are made of fiberboard with a nice low luster black finish . 
it takes good few secs for it to open a mail . 
the acrylic canisters which often lose their seal after a few days . 
one piece for the top of the phone ,  another for the bottom . 
this case is really for exposing your phone to hard core abuse . 
just consider the design factor and you should be a happy camper . 
i love pyrex !  it s all i have in my kitchen . 
i try to keep the wok oily so the eggs don t stick . 
i thought it would smooth out with use and it has . 
heavy dark pans such as this one do produce a browner crust . 
we eat walnuts all winter and this cracker is fabulous !  . 
you have the heat of an iron skillet and the raised grills . 
where can you buy three pieces for $
i ve tried several kinds with suction ,  which always fall off . 
i use mine with my iphone num_extend and it s absolutely fantastic . 
then serve the sheet cake to guests and not the bear . 
the feel of a knife is very personal . 
received product on time and was very happy with the packaging . 
this is a handy tool for making very fluffy mashed potatoes . 
now need to find some good loose tea leaves . 
free shipping with amazon prime can t be beat . 
i just got a new iphone and have tried several cases . 
i just used my new grill for the first time tonight . 
if you place num_num small spoons on it you will have no problems . 
however ,  they are higher quality of course to be reused many times . 
it works very well and is simple and easy . 
seller shipped timely and it was in perfect order . 
i love this case ,  it is awesome and available for much handling . 
wow !  this are some amazing speakers for the price . 
this coffee maker has lasted two years under that kind of abuse . 
i always look amazon first when buying a product !  . 
i use it for cleaning windows and there are no streaks . 
it s great for loose leaf tea and for fine straining cocktails . 
im a potato freak and eat one or two a day . 
the product came within the time they said and in very good condition . 
connects instantly to my nokia num_extend and paired effortlessly on the first go . 
the temptation is to overfill to make large amounts . 
cleanup can be cumbersome ,  but the popcorn always tastes great . 
just as pictured ,  a replacement for the one i broke . 
perhaps i m just not seeing the purpose num_extend
nothing special here just a good maple cutting board . 
unfortunately this is mainly because the hoover is a whole lot flimsier . 
it s performance in noisy conditions doesn t compare well to the others . 
i ve used several cheap peelers and decided to get something of quality . 
you can cook rice earlier in the num_extend
wilton represents the best of the best when it comes to baking products . 
when i was using the nexus s ,  the touchscreen keyboard was awful . 
it came well packaged and works just as they say . 
i am now going back to this one . 
the polycarbonate cover has a nice matte finish to it . 
my son destroys everything ,  but this case has lasted a long time . 
the effectiveness seems to vary with amount of water in it . 
this holds up the the great quality of the cuisinart brand . 
i should have gotten this years ago  or at least one like it  . 
i cooked lemom chicken scallopini with spinach in it . 
i use a cutting board at least three to four times per week . 
just wonderful !  !  i can actually wear this all day in comfort . 
okay ,  for about a hundred bucks ,  this is a deal . 
i ordered the new black chrome finish and it really is lovely . 
very comfortable when holding the tablet and fits great . 
have it for a month now and going strong . 
built quality seems to be the same as well . 
a fraction of the time the other one took . 
great for bread too and peanut butter sandwiches . 
forgot to soak dry beans overnight ?  no problem . 
good size ,  perfect depth for quarts ,  rack is beneficial . 
we also find that the juice just tastes better . 
these look nearly as good as they cut . 
i am happy with it and dont regret my purchase . 
plus it features a powerful induction motor for heavy dough . 
these are especially good for keeping cheese from going bad . 
but .  .  .  . it is better then the evo car kit . 
note num_num different sizes ,  regular and wide mouth . 
it has to snap in precisely ,  or the machine will not work . 
mix it bake it wash it do whatever . 
the protection is visible when the screen is off . 
as of right now ,  i would suggest this to anyone . 
yet as a pitcher ,  it is actually a bit heavy to use . 
i use two to hold up my calendar but that s fine . 
and best of all ,  made in the usa . 
just add the ingredients ,  set it and forget it . 
so happy that this is carried through amazon . 
i highly recommend this !  great for ice tea ,  iced coffees etc . 
this nordic ware popcorn popper is totally worth the price . 
it also feels like it can also absorb some shock if it falls . 
we get a nice uniform grind and great coffee from this grinder . 
wanted the car charger for my droid num_extend
if you don t own one you need to buy one . 
we finally had to break down and buy a second staub . 
i waited several months before writing a review on my oster beehive . 
i bought these skewers because they were suggested by cook s illustrated magazine . 
this thing is pretty much a must for any kitchen . 
toss the coffee because it will taste funny . 
finally a great solution for grating citrus rinds ,  nutmeg and other stuff . 
easy to use and i feel safe with it . 
it drains well and so far i am pleased . 
the grip has an adjustable arm so it can adapt to various cases . 
you can use these anywhere because they are removable . 
these are excellent kitchen cutlery for a reasonable price . 
so making large loaves or large pizza crusts are easy . 
the more i use them the better the lids go on and off . 
just as good as the very expensive ones . 
i get some milk and mix it up with the same stand mixer . 
i spoke with a family member out of state for about num_num minutes . 
this is a normal sized spoon ,  right at num_extend long . 
there was enough batter left over to make some cupcakes . 
i have a stainless steel kitchen and this matches everything . 
if you charge the phone overnight the phone will last you all day . 
great item to keep your suitcase organized while traveling . 
i carry num_num with me at all times . 
heat water in a pot to a full  rolling  boil . 
it pairs up with my mac num_extend no problems . 
our bench arrived without any chipped or broken pieces . 
otterbox delivers great quality again with the num_extend defender case . 
bought this for our restaurant to make tartar sauce . 
it won t slide when you have it sideways . 
not huge dishes but worked well in our camper . 
my only complaint which is for the manufacturer not the seller . 
after the num_extend day ,  it was perfectly prepped for use . 
no complaints on either end with call clarity or volume . 
i had an older plantronics from back when they started getting popular . 
i accidentally dropped mine on the floor and it didn t break . 
i bought this about a year and a half ago for my stepdad . 
only used it once but it works rather well . 
there are several handle designs ,  but personally i like the classic . 
once that thing broke ,  i decided to try a hoover instead . 
i looked at and read the reviews of the other replacement beakers . 
it is a hard case and protects my product well . 
my desk top computer and our coffee pot !  oooooops heheheheh . 
these little things actually save me a fortune in the long run . 
you will absolutely love baking with this pan . 
our church liked it so much they purchased one themselves . 
it is solidly constructed and the handle feels comfortable . 
got this bluetooth a few days ago ,  and it s great . 
i am curious what type of plastics are being used in brita . 
this portable and lightweight portable battery charger is just what i needed . 
i believe we will only need to replace ours yearly if that . 
it does everythingyou would want a phone to do and even more . 
the best   .  .  .  i have spent in the kitchen !  . 
place setting consists of :  dinner plate; salad plate; bowl; mug . 
i have used it much more than i thought i would . 
this is annoying but not a deal num_extend
some are brighter; others are on the flat side . 
it was what i needed for the cake to turn out perfectly . 
it s a great size and feels good in use . 
looks just like the photo , the buttons are num_extend like . 
i have heavy spatulas that are restaurant quality and i like these better . 
this was the best headset i have ever had !  . 
necessary piece to have if you have the entire setup . 
my second choice would be the tpu high gloss black . 
it barley fits ,  but is completely stable at all speeds . 
it was beautiful having the two rooms coordinated . 
this is what an ice cream scoop should be . 
fewer things to go wrong ,  is my motto . 
i even let him use it before i gifted the knife to him . 
don t have anything bad to say about this one !  . 
that tool did a good job for us . 
i think this is product is a very good value . 
fit with my captivate is a bit loose ,  but acceptable . 
does what it is sopposed to and keeps my wall outlets free . 
i m very happy with it ,  though i have made mistakes . 
the shipping was timely ,  and the dutch oven worked as expected . 
in another mixing bowl ,  beat whole eggs slightly . 
my two have worked well and this new one is great . 
this vacuum is an excellent value for the price . 
i use this for storing cold cuts and salads . 
it takes batteries and they last quite a long time . 
excellent for chopping garlic or parsley ,  or whatever small amount . 
i can t believe it was as affordable as it was . 
there is hardly an unpopped kernel left after it has finished popping . 
these pots are very heavy but makes a scrumtious loaf of bread . 
you cannot use common break recipes in any bread maker . 
i bought this pan due to the more contemporary profile .

i ve yet to find a timer with such simplicity and easy adjustment . 
i bet i add more to it later on . 
in num_num minutes it was done without any problems . 
i don t really have a complaint for it . 
the charging case is a great accessory too .

the jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation . 
i use this air filter around area where my dogs are . 
it would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible . 
the first sticker is there to tell you to remove the plastic backing . 
they are just as they were presented and came right away . 
the reviews are what made me buy these corn holders . 
it also works great as a knife for all cheeses .

even more now ,  because this machine makes a real ,  distinct difference . 
i really like the blue tooth clipper and use it with my nokia num_extend
i just thought i d mention it for others . 
a very good hands free product for your vehicle while driving . 
i did not experience any aftertaste that some reviews were mentioning . 
and if i m not driving i m in an airport . 
the motor is very strong ,  the blade very sharp . 
this is the best design i ve seen yet . 
some reviewers have noted that the charge doesn t last long . 
while they are plastic ,  they seem durable enough for me . 
surprisingly good length and works pretty well considering the inexpensive price . 
i have had no problems with it keeping a seal . 
season the steak with some salt and pepper or a rub . 
generally use a very small amount of butter or coconut oil when frying .

i can barely feel them when trying to adjust the volume . 
solid construction ,  does the job that i want it to do . 
comes up to heat quickly and regulates well . 
i got this to use on my induction cooktop . 
great for the car or walking around the city listening to music . 
i d take the permanent filter over disposable any day . 
this color  hot pink  is really hot pink !  !  i was surprised . 
i recently braised short ribs with this and it turned out terrific . 
we buy our meat at costco then grind and freeze . 
once it stretches out a bit it fits everything . 
then came the task of putting them back together . 
it works great but has a very cheap look to it . 
you can get a different style for less . 
this blender is enjoyable to use and very easy to clean ,  too . 
but it was here exactlly when they said it would be . 
i was expecting a few more bells and whistles though . 
the remote control is great and the unit is very quiet . 
if i have any problems with them i ll let you know . 
i ve been through a few cordless headsets and all were pretty disspointing . 
i also have a tiny one but i use this one the most . 
now i don t have to worry about that !  . 
listening to music is not the targeted use for this headset . 
probably best for the money for % of everyone else . 
even better ,  i use less oil to cook eggs with this skillet . 
the system keeps food free of freezer burn . 
got these for some old jars i picked up in trade markets . 
i cannot recommend this little food processor highly enough . 
i m so happy to have more glass bowls . 
he is very well pleased with the pan . 
it is an example of minimalist functional design . 
considering the price i should say this is a good battery . 
our family has enjoyed years of great waffles off this device . 
i ve wanted a slicer for years ,  and finally got this edgecraft . 
i found that grinding meats to be very useful . 
doesn t offer a charcoal grill flavor ,  but really ,  quite excellent . 
i don t know how i lived without it . 
heats water quickly ,  wireless pour ,  and auto shut off !  . 
this sleek looking little handset has a lot of uses . 
i cook pork butt roasts seasoned with italian porketta and garlic . 
i used it for the car ,  floors ,  seats . 
i wouldn t recommend this pillow for stomach sleepers . 
keeps the air invisible on my winter smoking porch . 
my plastic containers had grown old and developed strong smells . 
this one is protective and clear as glass . 
or ,  if it is ,  it s pretty bad leather . 
they are very sturdy and clean up very well . 
 :  and have a camera handy to capture your progress ! enjoy !  . 
in my opinion you can never have too many of these . 
i use this to met and clarify butter . 
the edges cutting were not smooth like the apple s bumper . 
if your looking for an intermediate processor than i highly recommend this product . 
this pitcher is perfect to use with my new expresso machine . 
because the sides are slightly raised it does keep her in place . 
we have bought probably num_num of these num_num for each vehicle . 
that was on january num_extend and i didn t get it until january num_extend
i loved this pan the first time i used it . 
very nice feature ,  this is well worth the money for cheap !  . 
i love them better than the deeper ones i have had before . 
it is very ,  very quiet which is a big plus for me . 
i opened it for fun but once i put it on . 
it looks like it would be perfectly at home at bozo t . 
i have used the seidio battery before on my previous htc incredible . 
just short of filling my coffee cup once . 
and the rubberized coating helps prevent it from sliding around in my pickup . 
this purchase was relatively inexpensive relative to the average coffee maker market price . 
the battery life got shorter and shorter over time . 
the product was very nice for the money and delivery was very fast . 
we only realized later that amazon offered a much better deal !  . 
i cant imagine any better for the price . 
i love it and the price here was so fabulous !  !  !  . 
it is by far the best silicone spatula on the market . 
after i placed this protector it helped a lot . 
i have two whisks ,  this one ,  and a silicone covered whisk . 
looks much better in person than in picture . 
i ll tell you why this measuring cup is so amazing . 
i m afraid for my life ,  or losing a finger ,  sometimes . 
when i bump hard from underneath ,  it clatters yet falls into place . 
there are no spill issues like with my old brewer ,  either . 
it s a little slow ,  but doesn t really matter . 
i am happy with this for non  cakey  waffles . 
i have used the zagg shields on num_num different phones and love it . 
but i ve never had an issue having otterbox replace this for free . 
works great at protecting the phone from scratches . 
that could have been the ac unit that i bought too though . 
it is a quality rice cooker and looks great too . 
absolutely love this knife ,  only regret i didn t buy this sooner . 
and it looks like it would be easy to do . 
this machine is heavy ,  noisy and not fun to clean . 
it sits perfectly flat on my glass stove top . 
it s made with good quality cast iron but not to heavy . 
it is solid cast iron with handles that are easy to grab . 
i am thoroughly enjoying being able to learn at my own pace . 
brita is a good brand and i needed these at the time . 
they are pretty stable in my ears and have really good sound . 
they d also be perfect for small herbs or flowers . 
the battery and cover are extremely easy to install and get setup . 
for that reason ,  i m happy with the table . 
the only change i d make to it is add a timer !  . 
in short ,  this tool does its job with aplomb . 
home fries ,  a grilled cheese ,  i could go on and on . 
this has gotten num_num years of canning on it with no problems . 
i would give it four stars if the handle were a bit stiffer . 
i purchased these for the wife and her ipad . 
it is much bigger than i thought it would be . 
i m very happy with my jabra num_extend headset . 
i just bought a second one for my new car . 
the seller eforcity shipped out same day ,  item arrived in perfect condition . 
it s so good there is a lifetime warranty . 
my tiny kitchen with severely limited storage was giving me fits . 
i like very tender meat like in chinese restaurants . 
perhaps a hook for the measurements would be nice . 
so it doesn t flip out when you don t want it to . 
i would recommend it to anyone and everyone !  . 
she used it and sent me a picture of the result . 
i have a few siphons and this is one of my favorites . 
also received it before the date it gave me of arrival . 
it makes a huge mess without the guard . 
but he is very good at chipping and breaking glasses and dishes . 
however ,  i can tell you that it is great for what i num_extend
the color is very nice and does charge my phone . 
it paired with my samsung num_extend in a couple of seconds . 
i use mine every few days for juicing . 
i bought two and have used them for several months . 
the elastic band is adjustable and can easily accommodate different sized arms . 
saute pan with helper handle  currently on sale for about $
it also is perfect for fliping and turning and chopping in the pan . 
it was the first and it s still the best vacuum bags around . 
they do a good job of staying in my ears . 
nice rubber grips so your fingers don t slip . 
it has a nice handle and cup size . 
however ,  i would be willing to pay more for programmable features . 
i am very happy with this replacement digitizer . 
i received my misto oil sprayers today !  i m really excited . 
don t hesitate to buy this masher you will be happy you did . 
to my surprise ,  this case fits the num_extend perfectly . 
any color zebra print is fine with me . 
my husband and i are cooks and we have used them quite regularly . 
i ended up with their oxygen model as a part of this mishap . 
why try something else when this works so well ?  . 
i used it a lot more often than i thought i would . 
easy to use once you figure out the manual . 
if not thick glass ,  then at least a heavier ,  weighted bottom . 
unfortunately i did not read the description of the product . 
this is another great addition to my calphalon collection . 
it was easy to install and fits perfectly . 
these ,  on the other hand ,  are incredibly light . 
the was perfect and would buy again  :    :   . 
for french frys this is a great fryer . 
the other remarkable thing to me is how fast it cooks . 
use an oven thermometer to monitor the temperature of the chicken breasts . 
this works very well for bacon and sausage in the microwave . 
i really haven t had any problems cleaning it . 
but best of all is the ease of use . 
handle has a hole for easy hanging and storage . 
the hole at the top keeps the tub from overflowing . 
i prefer buying in the set with the smaller blue one . 
then i had theidea of trying an electric knife . 
i love these mugs to make  egg mugs  by hungry girl . 
i was a little nervous about replacing my broken ipod screen . 
i will be using this plate as a serving tray . 
it changes from red to black as the egg cooks . 
easy to wear for an num_num hour shift at work . 
works great as an overall practical smartphone remote and good sounding headset . 
i found these headphone nice ,  however they didnt work for me . 
durable plastic ,  clever latches that work well to seal the top . 
unfortunately ,  the extra heat sometimes makes my lips raw and burning . 
this is a great product for the price and also the size . 
it has enough umph to charge while tablet is in use . 
they stay on but come off easily when you want them to . 
when i felt ready ,  i moved into our  good stuff  . 
i love these containers for storing food or for taking my lunch . 
love this !  it gets hot evenly so it cooks food consistently . 
i m glad i watched the video and it definitely did help . 
we have been using them for over a month and they are wonderful . 
however ,  i would still purchase this item again . 
there was about num_num specialty spoons and knives . 
got it at the suggestion of a reviewer . 
i use the same recommended quantities and it never burns or sticks . 
i will say that my own experience has been positive . 
i have not had a chance to use all the attachments . 
slightly annoying but not enough to make me not recommend the product . 
and remember be gentle when cutting your pizza on it . 
that wasn t really a problem though as we were constantly using it . 
i sleep better now than i have ever have . 
measurements are the same as other cooking methods . 
i usually eat soup or leftovers at work . 
i d love to see one like this that takes pods though !  . 
each morning after i use it i stick it back in the cupboard . 
quick and easy ,  also very efficient lemon squeezer . 
most of my cookie recipes call for a smaller scoop . 
the boy turned out to be a pretty good cook . 
it only adds about num_extend thickness to your iphone and no real length . 
no crowds ,  no shipping costs if you spend more than . 
on the desktop ,  the issue was related to windows num_num security . 
i would recommend getting an extra screen or two . 
the housing seem to be made of good quality materials . 
these diapers are a great value for the money . 
this is the best electric canopener i have ever owned . 
a couple of pulses and it is ground quite fine . 
this comes with a great video that shows you all about your appliance . 
a simple tool that adds so much to a drink . 
it all fit !  the outside is easy to clean as well . 
and have held up tremendously for our large family s everyday home cooking . 
for the price paid this is a very good deal . 
this one makes great crema from the first drop to the last drop . 
a fairly simple unit to use ,  just plug it in . 
 i have num_num kids so i would recommend this steamvac for many reasons . 
so i took the plunge and purchased this model . 
after years of doing without it i finally have it back . 
i am using it with iphone num_extend and blackberry ,  no problem . 
amazon s prices and promo discount made this possible . 
it holds my iphone num_num upright so i can see the clock easily . 
does not have tips like num_extend num_extend etc . 
if you get it too hot and it will smoke you out . 
now i can fill cupcake tins much faster . 
we d definitely buy another set in the future . 
from education with which to nurture the evolution of the art ,  . 
its great when cutting in butter that is cold but not frozen . 
it was a perfect fit and required no trimming . 
minimal warping ,  no tearing or fading of colors . 
color is not a bright red ,  but a little lighter red . 
the pot has pour spouts and it looks fantastic . 
it doesn t clog and you don t need to buy bags . 
got tired of automatic drip coffeemakers lasting a few months . 
i would prefer that the nylon heads had a higher temperture tolerance . 
this case came exactly as described ,  was durable and super cute . 
the item looks just as seen on the website . 
i bought this my my hubby who likes his coffee to stay hot . 
i got these lenses for my girls to use on their iphones . 
the locking mechanism seems solid and appears like it will last . 
and it wasn t even expensive in comparison to other iphone cases . 
he did research in cooks illustrated and they recommended this one . 
it also fits the num_extend indoor dutch oven . 
it s great having filtered water ready and waiting for me . 
this is great quality and a great price . 
i got this for my birthday about num_num years ago . 
this is just the right weight and just the right size . 
but the touch sense still works perfectly even under the plastic . 
the mophie will not last me the entire day . 
to say that i was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement . 
please refer my other review for num_num ounce mixing bowl . 
i had tried bluetooth headphones once before about four or five years ago . 
i ve been using these for awhile and really like them . 
the clarity is outstanding and it is loud ,  quite loud . 
daily water output is a perfectly valid way to rate a humidifier . 
i have used it every day since getting it . 
the case lasted longer than the phone did . 
no after tastes of plastic and it seems to keep colder . 
my daughters friend says this case is really nice and protects her phone . 
very good but all of mine are cracked .

pyrex has it all figured out after so many years in business . 
i saw a lot of knife sharpeners out there .

during summer months ,  the air outside gets pretty cool . 
it is not too thin and it is not too thick . 
should have bought these in the first place . 
she doubted its ability to replace the oven .

it s for sale in retail stores at double the price !  . 
i used it anyway for bacon and pancakes . 
i use this kettle all the time to make hot water for tea . 
also if yours sounds bad you got a fake . 
these make cracking a lovely little lobster effortless . 
it s thick glass and you can tell it s a quality product .

i get so many compliments on it all the time . 
it will work on any kind of smart phone or tablet . 
this product is well made and a simple design . 
this popcorn popper is so easy and quick to use . 
i am not a small guy by i am not mr universe either . 
it picks up the water and leaves the carpet damp ,  not wet . 
scratches occur and are natural when using metal as opposed to ceramic bowls . 
it is very maddening when you cannot grab something hot in the pan . 
but it opens wide enough to fit under the faucet . 
i ve owned this thermometer for num_extend years now . 
what others are saying is true and not hype . 
bought the new trent num_extend and it fit the bill perfectly . 
the washed leather looks super and feels comfortable . 
i get positively paranoid if i forget my phone on my desk . 
the tape is kind of worthless . this is a great product overall . 
i like corelle because strict tlc isn t required while handling these dishes .

better that the cheap one that came with the ice bucket . 
the belt loop on this case is a num_num riveted button design . 
it is small ,  definitely lightweight and powerful enough for this . 
it is a perfect fit for my model phone and stays together perfectly . 
i remove it when i pack it in the case for transporting . 
let my children take it to their homes .

the only drawback i see at this time is the huge price increase . 
you will be super happy making your fresh pasta . 
ie its harmless other than maybe it doesn t look so good .

we really prefer them to the wooden ones . 
i would buy this again and would recommend it to a friend . 
i got all num_num sizes of this on a combo deal . 
i haven t used a vehicle charger for cell phones in years . 
the stand on the back of this case is cool . 
i believe they have a smaller size one though . 
it works well ,  but it is a mess to use and clean . 
we like them so much that we gave two more as gifts . 
didn t pay much but i love the heck out of it . 
none of them seem to be going anywhere . 
the phone slides easily but snuggly into the holister . 
making pasta is not like using a breadmaker . 
first one was purchased over num_num years ago ,  and it still works . 
it would be about perfect for a num_extend skillet . 
if you are in a loud environment you will be disappointed . 
it works very well and it protects very well . 
i like that these are plastic and sturdy !  no rusting . 
now my only problem is that the directions did not make this clear . 
i like how easy it was to put on the phone . 
i have no regrets in making the purchase . 
it s not as complex as it seems when watching cooking shows . 
just takes a few rings to pair up to answer .

holds our complete fiesta kitchen knife set with ease . 
a good little timer .  .  . a bit on the loud side . 
for the price it works and is doing it s job . 
i really like it but the quality is not the best . 
i purchased the samsung focus on the first day the phone was available . 
i requested a replacement with the correct filter ,  will see what happens . 
easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available . 
so far ,  the bodum has been entirely immune to static issues . 
has the same battery life as my original droid battery . 
i have always loved fiesta ware but ,  never purchased . 
the other concern is that they lack versatility . 
this is a good product at a reasonable cost . 
which makes a mess ,  and poses a fire hazard . 
no problem with motorola id phone excepted this battery without any problems . 
don t ever try to slice food without it . 
the smoke leaked into homes ,  even with air conditioning . 
i always struggle to find good cases for my cell phones . 
i actually got rid of the top and just use the bottom piece . 
i prefer a wired headset to make calls as well . 
and for electronics ,  running  hot  usually means a shorter lifetime . 
installed a month ago with moen curved shower rod . 
i used it to bake a beautiful german chocolate cake . 
this set seems to be very well made and is still like new . 
just remember to thank me when you devour your first perfect bagel . 
i have always wanted a mortar and pestle . 
once you have a misto ,  you ll never go back !  . 
i have num_num teenage boys so i have to cook large meals . 
i did reorder the correct one and i love it . 
i purchased this saucepan because of the way the other preformed . 
otherwise this sharpener will not do the job it was designed to do . 
the crust was nice and crunchy ,  all the way to the center . 
it is well made ,  other than the rather cheap carabiner included . 
i usually cut off immediately and use microwave to reheat later cups . 
they never gave me any type of credit or extra time . 
and the customer service is awesome . now on to this product . 
it is easy to use and picks up cat hair easily . 
i ordered this dinnerware to go into our new motorhome . 
i know own about num_num of these different covers . 
you will not be sorry if you do . 
our granddaughter loves to turn the crank and hear it popping . 
it can filter a cup of water in about num_num seconds . 
i prefer to add olive oil ,  butter or coconut oil for flavor . 
even for regular drop recipes ,  this results in much more uniform cookies . 
i guess jawbone finally read the amazon reviews here . 
it fit snug and the clip is strong . 
prompt cleaning and drying prolongs the sharpness of the blades in my experience . 
i use these clear jars as canisters in both kitchen and bath . 
so i have no functioning complaints until something malfunctions . 
the only draw back is that it is very loud . 
but trying to take this on off is a pain . 
without the preservatives that is in baby food at the store . 
finally decided to go ahead and purchase one of my own . 
life to too short to use cheap barware . 
i have no complaints with either of them . 
gps with google map with installed text to speech working outstanding . 
wife broke the original and this was less than ordering from the factory . 
what fun !  makes really delicious nice big fat baby waffles . 
i had one for more than a year that i got from ebay . 
sleek design that holds a high volume of water . 
i was able to keep the case on my iphone . 
i can do that with num_extend of my plastic ones . 
i made a cheesecake and the num_extend was perfect for that . 
i have a tendency to break the tools i use . 
but it s certainly ample large and sturdy enough . 
i rate this kettle a big emphatic !  num_num stars !  . 
what more do you need or want in a whisk ?  . 
but i think that s why i use it so often . 
i like to cook on cast iron on my stove in the winter . 
it should be the only  tea kettle  one will ever need . 
i bought this based on my friend s raving reviews about it . 
great pairing device for both my iphone and ipad . 
it is well made and easy to install . 
very happy with product and will charge their ipods multiple times . 
cord is very short so that makes it safer to use . 
i have dropped mine ,  and the protector saved it from damage . 
not because the smartphone is bad at all . 
i also got it for a fantastic price . 
it keeps my floors cleaner than mopping ,  etc . 
returned my oreck in favor of this one . 
i wouldn t even have minded paying num_extend for this case . 
this is my first experience with cast iron and i am in love . 
my previous bread machines produced crust that was much more inferior . 
this is not my experience so perhaps things have changed . 
i bought num_num because the price was good . 
it s not the phones it s the way the netowrk is now . 
you may know that we seattle residents are mad for coffee . 
got this for school to carry my id and some money . 
unlike my previous cooker ,  the ceramic pot is easy to clean . 
perfect cup size ,  very sturdy and durable pan . 
i guess it fits better with num_extend instead of num_extend
apparently the tea my husband drinks steeps perfectly in num_num minutes . 
anything to high and this case probably wouldn t do much good . 
i d have bought it a lot sooner if i knew it existed . 
it never comes apart unless you need it to . 
highly recommend this if portable power and price are a factor . 
it brews smooth coffee and it does it quickly . 
watch the video for pointers it was very helpful . 
whiz it all around for several seconds ,  then drink up . 
it has a pleasing sound when the time is up for cooking etc . 
amazingly sharp tip ,  slices all things like its butter . 
well ,  it was for her until i fell in love with it . 
i will be buying some more for christmas gifts in the future . 
all in all ,  though ,  it s a nice grill . 
my biggest complaint on this device is based on the charger . 
i use medium to low heat and everything turns out great . 
the small dc stuff like  the led ,  the clock  still works . 
i have a old percolator ,  and a nespresso . 
yes ,  make sure you purchase the correct size for your needs . 
i would recommend it to apartment and condo dwellers without hesitation . 
most utensils have a very slender profile which is standard . 
for the price and for its intended purpose it is an absolute bargain . 
it s all clad so i knew the quality would be there . 
i bought this for my best friends bridal shower . 
hard shell provides good phone protection but crystals shatter on impact . 
they look brand new without any wearing of the finish . 
i use it twice a week to make whole grain breads . 
the clipperton brand of rings also appears well made of good materials . 
it heats up quickly and fits perfectly on a shelf in my cabinet . 
this pitcher heats up fairly quickly with the right machine . 
you can also access all the buttons nicely . 
this thing is a tank and will last forever . 
the sound is clear and full on both ends of the conversation . 
i like this platter because it is a good size for serving . 
whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until denatured and a bit num_extend
perfect size to fit in the palm of your hand . 
very easy clean up and looks great on the counter . 
each of those set us back about $ apiece . 
the product is high quality and seems durable . 
i had to rma the first unit and it upset me . 
i ve used a sunbeam hot shot for about num_num years . 
carries well in almost all my phone holsters ,  and looks good . 
it is so clear that i actually forgot that it was installed . 
i can only say that i absolutely love it . 
the battery lasts and the ease of use could not be simpler . 
it has a large easy to remove collection tank ,  easy to dump . 
and the price is great as well and what i was looking for . 
the caddy is heavy duty which is good and bad . 
i tried to fillet a salmon but it didn t cut through easily . 
i don t think the container is heavy as some people have mentioned . 
still need a charge as the day wears on . 
plus you can remove anything you don t want to use . 
the num_extend cup size choppers are just to small . 
have a complete set of them for num_num years . 
i bought this to replace my wife s broken old one . 
this is a high quality fan worth every penny . 
it still performs like the day we bought it . 
very good audio quality on receive ,  with ample volume num_extend
this size is my favorite knife for nearly everything . 
overall it s a durable case that protects well . 
the xlink will pay for itself after the first month . 
comes with a front screen protector  but i didn t use num_extend
i have started to simplify my life and have gone back to basics . 
does an excellent job of helping to kneed the dough . 
it s the same female voice that s in my jabra cruizer num_extend
i had this same device for my samsung vibrant . 
the making of these is a great concept . 
the oxo good grips mini clips are perfect . 
i must say it s not that bad once you put it on . 
now we know and haven t had that problem since  . 
my one issue is that the biggest knife seems a little bit flimsy . 
you just never know when you will need to sneak in a charge . 
it does need a little sharpening done to it . 
this does what it was intended to do . 
the headset has interchangeable rubber ear buds to fit different ear sizes . 
i have had these scissors in my house for probably num_num years . 
perfect for storing bottles on their side in the cooler or fridge . 
just what i wanted . very pleased with the set . 
its not clystal clear sound but no issues . 
a product like this is not so new to us . 
as everyone says ,  silpat is a great product . 
no more costly ground pork from local grocery stores . 
i have used the palm iii ,  treo ,  blackberry ect . 
it s the most important tool in your knife set . 
well built ,  i believe i read made in usa . 
these have the least water and will have the best texture . 
i wanted only to have the best items in my kitchen . 
i believe that dropping does the most damage rather than the dishwasher . 
there is room for num_num sponges which is nice . 
in fact ,  if you wear eyeglasses ,  it s very uncomfortable . 
i ve tried other systems and have always gone back to chemex . 
many products seem to be made much cheaper these days . 
this pan has a nice weight to it . 
we have this heater down in the basement to add some extra heat . 
i made french toast as soon as i got it ,  wiped clean . 
another reviewer says he does it with success . 
it may be projecting in a different way than it appears . 
bought this on amazon a coup , e of years ago . 
it amazes me how much really rough old ones go for on ebay . 
you won t find a better fan for less . 
go ahead ,  i dare ya . > medical marijuanaget over it people . 
i ordered these pads to replace ones i ve had for years . 
 i cannot really imagine steaming anything in a num_num qt . 
it s been really nice on my knives too . 
my husband loves it and uses it almost every night !  . 
haven t tried steaks yet ,  i m sure we will soon . 
it pushes fairly easily for not being self propelled . 
the headset easily paired to my samsung nexus s num_extend android phone . 
ok i use it in the microwave with this bowl . 
i got the smallest one and it s still huge . 
i have many oggi canisters in different sizes and just love them . 
the included sharpening rod will help you complete this task in little time . 
the included casters work very well and even is of the locking type . 
great price for num_num of the best screen protectors out there . 
i use it as a soup bowl or even a chili bowl . 
the coffee tastegreat coming from the filter process of these filters . 
i got what i thought i would and i liked the rubber case . 
you have to dig your finger into the hole . 
small adjustments are needed to switch from smaller to larger apples . 
the kick stand is very nice as well . 
i bought this charger for me and my wife s torch num_num devices . 
i ve also made my own barbecue sauce in it . 
i wish they made a higher capacity battery for the palm pixi . 
great size ,  easy to use ,  easy to clean up . 
we got this set because we have started making our own coffee creamer . 
it only comes with one ,  so it better work for all ears . 
broom and dust pan just wasn t cutting it . 
this set is very beautiful and reasonably priced . 
overall ,  i have very few gripes about this phone . 
i have had this jar for about num_num months now . 
it s a plastic two peace case that snaps together . 
solid made plate and of course made in the usa !  great price . 
i can freeze the exact mix of fruit i want ahead of time . 
just buy it and then you wont have to buy crap . 
i cannot honestly say which system is best ,  android or ios . 
my wife has been using it and it has really proctected the ipone . 
i have had both hoovers products and the competitor . 
the screen protector fit perfectly and he was very happy with the results . 
the first is that removing food from them is so much easier . 
the product was packaged properly and arrived safely and quickly . 
you just load it up with icing and start spreading . 
i was trying to put the case on wrong . 
i already have a set of these ,  and i love them . 
i have used it three times and each time like it more . 
it gets really hot so be careful if it sits under a cabinet . 
have used the shallow pan and the muffin pan . 
the first is that removing food from them is so much easier . 
desk top is large time display with plenty of options . 
the additional light included is nice but ive never used it . 
the machine has a beautiful stainless steel design looks much better in person . 
my mother s set is still flawless and still looks great . 
this one works much better and the vacuum lasts longer . 
these should be used as only the roughest of guides . 
it has tsp ,  tbs ,  oz ,  and ml markings . 
stylish and very professional looking !  awesome ! so far it works !  . 
however ,  i was pleasantly surprised when i found these . 
i purchased this grater on the recommendation of cooks illustrated . 
i got this as a mother s day present for my mom . 
getting it attached to the tank is not intuitive . 
this was a christmas present and does everything it needs to . 
great sound quality and volume for a relatively small speaker . 
i also have a complete set of pyrex measuring cups as well . 
i have to think that varying amounts of ingredients ,  etc . 
the good news is i will drink less coffee during the day . 
i m still adjusting to how much coffee to put in . 
size is bigger than noted in description said . 
not much to say about a power adapter . 
the salt shaker comes with salt in it . 
pairing with my android phone worked like a charm . 
we use this all the time and it has held up very well . 
it s rigid enough to hold its shape and to protect the contents . 
over the years ,  i have tried so many . 
they are easy to install and come with three of them . 
we used the belgium waffle mix from the store . 
it worked well and came in on time . 
but you wouldn t want a loose phone case . 
that way you are prepared no matter where you go . 
let me tell you that they are used daily in my kitchen . 
once the protector is on ,  then comes the silicone based inner shell . 
everything about it has been great ,  with a few minor exceptions . 
i do not like the gold filter but my husband does . 
i even take this with me when i drive to go on vacation . 
i try to freeze it for num_num hours before use . 
this is only a minor inconvenience ,  but it is worth mentioning . 
you can t even tell you just cut something . 
i tied this to my cel phone ,  and it works fantastically . 
i recieved the scooba for christmas ,  and loved it . 
i use it all the time i bake . 
callers in the other end do not notice i am using a headset . 
i would like to make a suggestion for improvement . 
there are not your cheap dollar store magnets !  . 
the drive motor attachment does not fit snugly at all on the drive . 
there isn t a day i don t use it . 
screen protectors are best if you don t know they re there . 
you only need a little coloring to achieve your desired color . 
i needed a headset for when i m in the car . 
the mount stays on the dashboard and everything is fine . 
but then the design made sense when i tried it . 
don t even bother buying another brand of hand mixer . 
things taste same or less greasy ,  and it feels much healthier . 
hanging is an option for storage and probably the best one . 
the music sounds so good that i ordered the palm headset as well . 
i have had it now for a year and it has worked flawlessly . 
the other problem is that the instruction booklet is poorly done . 
wait num_num to num_num seconds for water to cool . 
again ,  i m all about speed ,  efficiency and convenience . 
in addition ,  the plug goes easily into the phone . 
while this is functionally excellent ,  it is not especially stylish . 
it provides a solid grip for most items . 
i love how fast this sandwich grill is . 
your kitchen aid stand mixer will be around for a long time . 
truthfully ,  it looks even sharper in person than the pictures convey . 
i bought this as a gift for someone . 
you decide how much  real  butter you want to add . 
the lid even sits on top with the jar . 
the large size is fantastic ,  though it s definitely heavy . 
it worked perfectly ,  almost more like a tiny blender . 
i have dropped em numerous times ,  nothing happens . 
first time i ve added airtime to my phone . 
i ve had good like with this and many other kitchen aid appliances . 
i wanted a glass bottle to keep my sangria cold in the fridge . 
out of a half cup of kernels num_num didn t pop . 
they are sturdy enough to securely hold drinks and snacks . 
growing up in japan ,  i was aware that something like mr . 
this crock came packaged like a museum piece . 
we have generally been happy with all oxo products . 
this is a good water heater for the price . 
the mike picks up just what it needs to . 
the belt clip does not sure the phone very well . 
i was pleasnantly surprised with the quality of this item . 
and it wasn t aligned so it was sticking out in a corner . 
i use same type of tool for woodworking . 
my cookies brown beautifully and they never ,  ever stick . 
the plug and play installation is a snap . 
i could do without the bright led s though . 
first ,  clean the screen so nothing is left on it . 
all the buttons are very easily available with the cover . 
it has the weight of the traditional bundt pans . 
i thought i was buying a charger only . 
they fit just perfect and were thick enough to survive the move . 
this case is the best i have found yet for an iphone . 
after num_num years ,  my grillerator finally stopped doing it s job . 
it does not heat up like the plates we were previously using . 
where did i sit those fava beans and my chianti ?  . 
it tightens to hold the phone securely and then loosens easily . 
just toss in some veggies and in a few minutes you re done . 
you must get some good carpenter s glue and glue them in place . 
in fact ,  it even fits more snugly than apple s . 
definitely recommend for all those ipad  first generation owners  . 
not all coffee mugs ,  especially larger plastic ones fit into the num_extend
first ,  i was able to figure it out . 
a replacement charger through my service provider would have cost me over $
that way it will be easier to properly protect it during shipping . 
works great now ,  but cost me $ for the repair . 
compare that to the size of your phone . 
when i saw this one ,  i had to try it . 
it is easy to use and very accurate . 
this is by far one of my favorite purchases ever . 
it makes good waffles easily and is easy enough to clean . 
our family consists of num_num adults and num_num preschool children . 
this set is quickly becoming my new favorite item . 
it connects to the standard headphone jack on most cell phones . 
i like to sprinkle o cakes and cup cakes . 
purchased for the kids ,  will purchase an extra one soon . 
really ,  the best money spent in the kitchen thus far . 
mine takes quite a while to get the full bars . 
i hate putting a screen protector on my iphone . 
with good marketing ,  they could put silpat out of business . 
the case was well packaged and received quickly . 
bass could be better ,  but overall not bad . 
highly recommend this maker to anyone who loves coffee . 
it is super sharp and gets the job done . 
close the lid and wait for the steaming to almost stop . 
i purchased this ice cream maker after reading all of the reviews . 
a little confusing at first but nothing i couldn t figure out . 
i recommend this product to anyone looking for a good processor . 
it took very little heat to maintain pressure . 
this is really nothing more than a charger . 
it is used so often ,  that i now have num_extend
just for your reference ,  here s my ice cream recipe . 
it doesn t have that glossy feel which i like . 
it s a touch screen ,  it s going to happen lol . 
for me the slim silicone case does well . 
the bundt pan is sturdy and heavy and has a beautiful design . 
for $ this case works great for me !  no complaints . 
if you buy whole bean coffee ,  this is the grinder . 
i bought the juicer attachment and started making my own orange juice . 
this battery at least resolves one of the two issues . 
three covers for $ so you re paying $ a piece . 
it would be better if it s glass instead of plastic . 
both batteries hold a charge like the seidio used to . 
these coasters are exactly what i was looking for . 
this soft case fits and feels really good . 
the last one i had i brought num_num years ago . 
only complaint is it took a month to get them . 
i wanted a good unit with good reliability . 
fun colors to choose from to add some pizazz to your kitchen drawer . 
the soft interior of this pouch keeps it from getting roughed up . 
i hope the baking cops don t find out . 
num_num unbleached paper cone filters now in place of the gold filter . 
i bought it because i like to use that grill . 
recieved this product with no actual razor cradle . 
i bought num_num of these and also have bowls from this brand . 
this works really well with older smart phones like lg optimus s . 
this was recommended on a site for butchering chickens . 
the lid is secure but can be removed and replaced easily . 
love the color and how functional it is . 
i used it last night to make stir fry and loved it . 
i have to say it s the best kafta i ve ever made . 
you wouldn t think that combination would be so hard to find . 
these were just the right size for my cake pops . 
would definitely purchase again for that nice  little touch  of coordinating cupcake wrappers . 
item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition . 
this is truly meant to be an international product . 
this pan is worth more than $ easily !  . 
the blade has a good shape for butchery and holds an edge well . 
just make the yogurt ,  and transfer to the cheese maker . 
volume range is important to me as well and this headset meets expectations . 
these measuring cups have a nice heavy feel to them . 
phone calls are clear and tight with very limited bt  noise  . 
this does help to keep bacon and other items flat whilst cooking . 
it is well made and i keep it with me a lot . 
the long handle makes it easy to get a grip . 
they are a good size ,  and work very well . 
i ve used nokia smartphones for awhile now starting with the num_extend

no burning or discolorization as other reviewers have mentioned . 
this steel ice tong looks rly great and works as it supposed to . 
anyway ,  we went back to the old trusty vicks vaporizer . 
everyone that i gave it to loved it . 
no need to enter the default num_num password . 
this keeps a long cord from being in the way . 
i bought this one for a friend who was using a paper towel . 
i really can t ask for more from a screen protector . 
i have a large kitchen so it stays on the counter . 
it comes with a cylinder that is marked with lines . 
very good unit if you do moderate amount of cooking . 
otherwise ,  i have some older lids from discarded pans i use . 
i suppose it provides some shock protection too . 
it detracts from the protection this case is supposed to offer . 
it keeps the glare down and still works well with my new iphone . 
my coffee has never tasted better and it is so easy to use . 
the quality is obvious ,  it s sturdy and beautiful . 
the lock is solid ,  easy to use ,  and quite num_extend
just as big as it was sold to be . 
it is not clear from the description that this is the case . 
it reads instantly and has a wide temperature range . 
it s the off set handle that does the trick . 
i ve had more bluetooth units that i care to recall . 
the control panel for the microwave features is uncomplicated and easy to set . 
it has a laser pointer which is nice . 
it s great fits tight and will lift up your screenprotecter . 
i would definitely recommend these for any iphone owner . 
the corners are square yet a little rounded just like a cassette tape . 
this is a nice case ,  but the relevancy is not there . 
it has never dropped a can until i physically remove the can .

i love the clip for attachment or removal from the ring . 
it did exactly what i wanted it to do . 
i bought these because my other rings were a pain . 
this is what made my review four starts instead of five . 
i use it for scooping my dry goods . 
it release very well and the impressions were really stood out . 
i wish it had come with much better instructions and maybe more recipes . 
very happy with this product ,  which cleans up like a snap !  . 
i have owned many many different bluetooth headsets over the years . 
this is a great cover and looks so sleek . 
i could access all buttons and be able to charge it . 
overall ,  i m very happy and would buy it again .

performance  outstanding  . wish that i had bought it sooner . 
would like to see a better variety of color or material options . 
the local retail store wanted $ for one screen protector . 
this product has been with me for a while . 
i realize i ll probably get the hang of it sooner or later . 
plan on buying one for each of my children for christmas . 
you will need the headphones plugged in to recieve radio stations . 
i priced around for a set that was good for num_num people . 
just have someone in your household who is patient . 
for super glue you just make a few lines across it . 
i just rubbed all of them off myself . 
i used to have a spatula similar to this one and loved it . 
the reason that i have two for myselves is that . 
good product for convenient and compact clothing collection . 
i love the fact there are two covers both top and bottom . 
i am very pleased with this product for the following num_extend
alright ,  this was my second purchase of a dehydrator . 
i plan on buying a second one soon . 
they dont break or scratch if you treat them well that is . 
then just repeat with that water and time in the future . 
and quality is writen everywhere in these plates . 
this way you do not over stress parts . 
on our part the amazon prime is worth it to us . 
i bought this small foot print fan because i have one at work . 
the base of the machine is colored plastic ,  not metal . 
very easy to sip out of ,  no drips ,  no mess . 
the unit talks to you telling you which station to set it to . 
i have tile floors in kitchen ,  baths and foyer . 
the seals and relief valves are essentially foolproof . 
you have to remove it and rinse it every time . 
i recommend thisproduct to those who appreciate quality . 
i have purchased several of the amco serving pieces and they are perfect . 
i bought mine after i bought one for my daughter . 
i bought another since it s good for larger plates . 
i love this iron  i iron lots of stuff  . 
i have to say i was extremely impressed by its performance . 
i have an extra one that i always keep in my camper . 
is it the best thing ever made ,  no . 
i ve ordered several and most of them bent or tipped over . 
$ and with prime arrived in num_num days . 
seller shipped out next day and received it in a few days . 
he hasn t expressed any issues with the case . 
this has enabled me to eat ice cream again . 
if you have the skill ,  the tools are great and very complete . 
that was including time to stop and read instructions with every step . 
great handle .  .  . solid and comfortable to chop on and on . 
i own about num_num otterbox cases now ,  this one being my third . 
have had this running continuously now for three years . 
compared to the juiceman ,  this thing is fabulous . 
so ,  i was a little skeptical about buying a pressure cooker . 
love this case ,  its a bright coral color which is my favorite . 
the best sharpener i have ever had ,  and at a fantastic price . 
nothing ruins a good brunch like a fragmentation grenade tossed into the party . 
i like them but they are not super duty materials . 
will not work with any case but nice . 
it arrived and i was surprised at just how small the bowl is . 
so for $ bucks ,  you can t go wrong . 
i was real hesitant to buy this battery . 
this one is the best i ve had by far . 
i m glad i read the other reviews ,  and bought this machine . 
since it is so heavy ,  shipping will be high . 
color looks nice and fit perfect on phone num_extend from sprint . 
took call and it muted the num_extend and switched over . 
this is a very strong and sturdy whisk with a nice solid handle . 
this is a good size grind for general cooking . 
it is one of the reasons i now purchase appliances via amazon . 
this bamboo bamboo block will fit almost any kitchen knife . 
she didn t have the luxury of these num_num years ago . 
product is well made and hopefully long lasting . 
this devices sound quality is just as good ,  if not better . 
makes delicious coffee and keeps it piping hot for hours . 
we got rid of all of our instant popcorn bags . 
cook until your angel tells you it is ready . 
the wide size is much easier for zesting . 
however it actually blinks red while charging and turns solid blue when complete . 
i ordered an extra battery and have both fully charged at all times . 
enter oxo with their good grips medium cookie scoop . 
first time using it ,  i thought it didin t work . 
i use it often to open cans and have not had any problems . 
lay in your pan and press it around the curves . 
the sticky tape is already attached to the screen for easier installation . 
when this came out i jumped on it . 
we it use every christmas eve to fry our pierogi for dinner . 
so i was actually the first one to use this . 
pops right into the dishwasher with no trouble . 
forget the reviews that knock this product because it s made in china . 
i use it all the time and love the rubber grip handle . 
i don t know why this thing got bad reviews . 
i definitely recommend this it s a great filter . 
she instructed me on what equipment she needed . 
the little nibs that hold this together are the weak point . 
this is my second anker battery for the phone . 
i stack them num_num in a stack in my cabinet . 
imo ,  it s the best processor on the market . 
not this time . i m editing my review from before . 
i put caramel corn and popcorn in these and it kept it fresh . 
i need every ounce of protection this thing provides . 
decent case ,  protected my tb from a couple of drops . 
i agree with another poster; the handle could be about an inch longer . 
from now on ,  we will only use shun classic in our kitchen . 
i have purchased additional dies from lello and look forward to trying them . 
steam comes from the upper lid of the presser . 
i tried a spoon that was hard to get cookie dough out . 
but what really impressed me was the daring offset handle on the lid . 
this item arrived when promised ,  was well packaged and therefore undamaged . 
once assembled it is screwed onto the threaded end of the sweeper . 
but it s a great addition for our kitchen . 
expectations were low but you know ,  this thing really does work . 
keeps my sponge and small brush neatly neat . 
i almost returned the icruiser because i thought it was defective . 
they fit and seem to be genuine parts . 
the salt and pepper set are everything i expected . 
very easy to use and effective ,  the brake is a great feature . 
is a must for my num_num yr old daughter . 
i ordered it on a sunday and it arrived the day after too . 
i preferred not having updates for facebook or any of that crap . 
buy yourself a few !  you won t regret it . 
the num_num cup is the perfect size for a big cup of coffee . 
i have owned a lot of android phones . 
it handles well and opens a can with very little effort . 
the hanging ring works ok but does not matter to me . 
the flare at the bottom makes it feel more secure in your hand . 
this takes up much less and toasts all thicknesses evenly . 
this is such a great item ,  especially for the price . 
now she has a new cooking or serving pot . 
workes perfectly for my htc evo num_extend shipped promptly !  !  . 
i am absolutely blown away with the suction power of this particular machine . 
soft tips ,  and they don t scratch my screen . 
this makes it easy and i am able to do quickly . 
soft around the neck and attaches to usb memory very securely . 
finally ,  i did not like the proprietary charging connector . 
it grates way faster than the old fine grater i used before . 
these are shallower and wider than most measuring cups . 
very simple ,  easy to use and easy to clean up afterwards . 
it s an awesome bluetooth piece available in the line of bluetooth headsets . 
i went ahead a shelled out the extra money for this battery kit . 
the richness of press coffee is in the thickness . 
she likes them too ,  which is a miracle in itself . 
i purchased this for my wife to use when working out . 
purchased this bottle opener to open metal cans of baby formula . 
it s not perfect ,  but there is some noticeable boost . 
i bought two of these to replace two i had for num_num years . 
i mention that because others have said it was loud . 
i m now telling all my friends and relatives about it . 
i also purchased the smaller size ,  and they are just as nice . 
now with this camoed cover i will have something to pass the time . 
but as of right now ,  i highly recommend this sharpener . 
ok ,  does it well ,  but no real foam . 
i have always liked this line in faberware . 
first non metal spatula i ve found that is really useful . 
i m perfectly satisfied with this case for my num_extend
i love the different ways you can wear it . 
if you buy this device ,  use it like num_extend
i just placed and order for num_num more sets . 
they came in super fast and in plenty of time for valentines day . 
these mixers depending on the job could render a kitchenaid stand mixer unnecessary . 
everything snaps together very well with a little effort . 
no ice or water to clean up either . 
for the money ,  they are really hard to beat . 
this blade functions well for the intended purpose . 
it is sturdy and beautiful at the same time . 
but this looked not bad and it was cheap . 
it does make a great pot roast too if that s your goal . 
also tried it with my nokia num_extend and it works perfectly . 
now we have this basket to stack them in . 
my wife and i grab this charger anytime we travel . 
within minutes ,  you have a delicious hot cup of coffee to savor . 
the stairs down to the basement and the kitchen have red carpet . 
once frozen ithem ,  i packaged them with a vacuum sealer . 
i love this model !  give it as gifts . 
i ve had many  bottom end  lasko s over the years . 
i ve had various stock pots in the past . 
on her way back she decided to use it . 
i guess you can tell how much i like this high speed kettle . 
dropped phone twice and no damage with this case on . 
just do it for your own viewing pleasure ,  please lol . 
secures nicely to my belt and holds the phone perfectly . 
if it ever breaks ,  i ll get another just like it . 
have enough to last me for guite awile now . 
i think this is one of those products everyone should have . 
i have had them for roughly num_num months now and im happy . 
it tends to push it in front of the power head . 
the bowls are lightweight ,  un breakable ,  deep sided and stackable . 
i use it for more than just cookies and ice cream . 
it does a wonderful job on everything from tomatoes to potatoes . 
the rubber outside was sloppy but the inner plastic is tough . 
i m planning to purchase a couple more for the very reasonable price . 
no problems with lid mismatching and the package arrived in good condition . 
the innocase clips easily and securely to the holster . 
great ,  nice pitcher for frothing milk !  nice size and sturdy build . 
i got these cause i already own some oxo stuff . 
i have been buying and grinding beans for years . 
i store it right in one of my num_num quart saucepans . 
if not ,  this would make an excellent start to a collection . 
it was very simple to connect to my phone . 
after about a dozen uses ,  mine is still intact . 
i was able to do mine perfect on the first try . 
this is my first large food processor and i love how it works . 
it remains bright and shiny if properly cared for . 
use at least once every couple of weeks . 
keep in mind ,  my son has not destroyed his phone yet . 
but even with that i am happy with them . 
it s just not worth it for boiling water or steaming veggies . 
other than that there isn t really much else i can say . 
other times i ll use more oil and some sugar . 
so this is the second case i bought for my iphone num_extend
this would give you num_extend years of use of your phone . 
so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities . 
this was an awesome case and miss it a lot . 
we make pickled eggs ,  also known here as red beet eggs . 
i found this online when i was looking for accessories for my cellphone . 
all num_num are excellent quality and perform just as the manufacturer states . 
and i could not have been any more correct . 
imo ,  this is not made for more than num_num servings . 
no damage to the phone of course ,  but annoying all the same . 
i picked this up for my dad and it s wonderful . 
the towel washes and dries easily in your machines . 
i have been paying a carpet cleaning service to come clean my carpets . 
just make sure you use higher quality popcorn like orville redenbacher . 
in any case ,  the num_extend grinds coffee quietly and evenly . 
still ,  everything including the marble top was in good shape . 
the case comes with a usb charging cable . 
i m glad i read the reviews before i received the pitcher . 
pull out all the junk that s accumulated in the tube . 
but i have tested it against the droid charge . 
i own this very same set of canisters in a pure white . 
it does not slip around on the counter . 
i cannot say enough nice things about this  little guy  . 
bought it for my friend and she loves it . 
yep ,  the hoover works just fine for us . 
this is a great thermometer and easy to clean . 
a little too big for my tastes ,  but i really like it . 
th filter plunger would stick at the top . 
i ve seen these around and finally gave it a try . 
the phone itself  samsung captivate  was one i had back in num_extend
the days of thin ,  cheap ,  stainless are over . 
i preheat the pan to num_num with the oven . 
very easy to get out of the drawer without jabbing myself on them . 
the top lid stops ingredients from flying out . 
some reviewers don t like this grater for cheddars ,  for example . 
good packaging and arrived within the time frame given . 
i use it for pizzas as well as cutting dough and simple pastas . 
just needed an extra charger and this does the job . 
one of them is in my num_num lexus num_extend
i use it to make most of my ice cream . 
they match well with all of the other items i purchased . 
a minute or two is all it tooki recommend this case . 
it can charge a cell phone and a bluetooth completely with one charge . 
neat little item but it has a few quirks . 
it is incredibly easy to program and operate . 
for the money this is a great product . 
i have never eaten soup from a prettier bowl than this . 
but i just couldn t see spending the money to replace them . 
we use this once every num_num months or so . 
bought this as a gift for a college freshman and she loves it . 
extremely pleased with the results it has yielded . 
i canned venison with this and it turned out great . 
far prefer glass to plastic containers and have basically converted almost totally . 
i missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one . 
the fan performs flawlessly and is fairly quiet . 
i wanted black so i bought them here . 
i like the fact that this citrus press is all stainless steel construction . 
yes ,  it fits as a great replacement for the original . 
they clean very easily with a soapy sponge . 
i was first introduced to the knife sharpener while in wausau ,  wi . 
they work wonderfully ,  so simple and easy to use . 
bought this as a gift for a young couple . 
others said that it only worked well for the first few days . 
words perfect with my grinder so i have just the right grind . 
we had one of the lesser variety breadmakers . 
recently i thought i would try to find something better . 
it is easy to clean and the price is perfect . 
also ,  the water dispenses at a somewhat slow pace . 
as usual your service and the product made up the expectations . 
it looks great with jeans or with a shirt and tie . 
loved them so much ,  we ordered one for every bedroom too . 
i purchased the little dipper so i could melt chocolate without burning it . 
num_extend to num_num hours talk time might not be enough . 
i will say though ,  you have to have some pretty strong thumbnails . 
most durable dinnerware i ve ever used and i am a savage . 
i would prefer a slightly shorter handle otherwise this is a decent product . 
its easy and to stow away into a backpack . 
you can make any size work for you . 
if you ever bake at all you need this . 
i also tried the same while i cut the grass . 
just wish it were a little nicer looking . 
so this is a pretty cell phone case . 
i can t believe i used to make spaetzle without one . 
when you re done with your frosting ,  simply throw it away . 
it is easy to hold and the balance is good . 
but there is no such problem with this peeler . 
the call quality was as good as they come . 
looks great and vintage looking which is what i was looking for . 
these rings have not had stained so we haven t needed the extras . 
this percolator sits nicely on the stove eye . 
i had one and really liked but decided to get a keurig . 
just a heartbeat or two after you push the button . 
he is currently studying culinary arts and likes the blender and the attachments . 
best feature is the large capacity of the cup . 
there is always a concern when purchasing a replacement battery on line . 
the color is off just by a little bit ,  but thats ok . 
great looking and no worries about oven use . 
the only place to store it is in the oven itself . 
perfect fit with not a lot of bulk . 
i chose this one primarily because of its design . 
use a dark roast bean and follow the instructions . 
i have had this machine for going on num_num years . 
oh also they go with any curtain or bathroom color . 
the only downside to an otherwise brilliant grill . 
i bought this machine on the recommendation of reviews from amazon . 
we will be making our own yogurt from here on out . 
thank you ,  amazon for pricing it so that i could afford them . 
the price is excellent and i received it in num_num days . 
i ve been using this model for num_num months now . 
i think this is the num_extend bag i bought . 
now i have this and i love it . 
finally ,  a knife that slices through everything easily ,  no work needed . 
definitely worth the purchase ,  good quality oem battery . 
it works !  are the knives razor sharp ?  no . 
poi s cannot be searched for by name except from the contact list . 
i will improve mine but not everyone is a mechanic like me . 
i reccommended this to my broker and now it is used quite often . 
i m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it . 
can mix with red wine vinegar and spray as dressing on your salad . 
i bought new ear clips on amazon that are rubber and fit great . 
i would recommend this to others and am very happy with the purchase . 
no problem w the semi noise in the background . 
my husband is an over the road trucker . 
i like the vibrant color ,  and it s operates as designed . 
the other screamed at you !  i recommend going with this cover . 
even my husband can  operate  it and likes to grate the cheese . 
these headphones are almost invisible to my attention . 
this scoop is actually kind of fun to use . 
it has taken a beating and still continues to work well . 
num_num people said that i sounded as though i was under water . 
to put my worries to rest the vacuum bag fitted perfectly fine . 
the excess water goes in the drip tray . 
getting all of my knives sharpened got pretty expensive . 
i really like to be able to talk to someone not on speaker . 
the juicer tear through everything like it was nothing . 
i would highly recommend this product to all my family and friends . 
you will see the difference when you try it both methods . 
i ve used it about num_num times by now . 
i put it in the phone and it works . 
also ,  i wish there was a less permanent way to mount it . 
purchased a while ago for my niece and she just loves it . 
this turns out a perfect small sized loaf . 
i received this item a few days ago . 
it is what i just what i ordered . 
the internet access with sidekick was an inferior platform that was num_extend slow . 
i don t have to worry about running low on battery . 
need to remove them from one s ears carefully though . 
still ,  because of the low price ,  this was a useful buy . 
make sure you rinse it in cold water before use . 
i am really happy with the num_extend pan . 
it works great and has held up to a lot of travel . 
cut food in smaller chunks to feed into the tube . 
i doubt if anyone ever regretted buying wusthof . 
the overall finish of the unit is amazing . 
they are wellmade and do what they are supposed to do . 
love it !  works great on many kinds of fruits and vegetables . 
i purchased this to keep my morning coffee hot at work . 
my fault for not reading the instructions thoroughly . 
i attached this to my cabinet above the sink . 
my old one was  contaminated  from past uses with wheat products . 
i also don t have to worry if i drop it  :   . 
i recommend and would buy again from them . 
used this for the first time this morning and it worked well . 
it protects the screen from scratches and fingerprints and etc . 
you want push email ?  you can get it . 
people who like to make yogurt cheese love making a lot at once . 
can t beat a set of num_num for a few dollars . 
i was surprised that here was so much missing . 
you can t use it on asian knives with a num_num degree edge . 
she can now make calls and the battery last much longer . 
also ,  it doesn t sit flat on the base . 
basted eggs literally slide out of the pan with zero friction . 
ordered it and within a few days it was delivered very well packed . 
i love oxo but interdesign knocked this one out of the park !  . 
the product is great ,  but the shipping is not . 
it lasted a long time so i am hoping this one will too . 
i especially like the feel of the handles . 
this is the some model i had before ,  i see no difference . 
we ve used this car power adaptor to charge mobile phones and headsets . 
extremely fast delivery num_extend days !  !  !  and well packaged . 
i chucked my big old vacuum and got this instead . 
these are the best pans i think you can buy . 
i have a lighter adapter and use this cable . 
somewhat hard to clean is my only complain . 
well ,  my zojirushi has put an end to thatthankfully . 
i had no problems what so ever with it . 
they fit all my various sized fido jars perfectly . 
i want to get away from using plastic . 
i love wmf so i am biased from the start . 
i bought this for my sister ,  who entertains frequently . 
i bought this device to replace one i had had for many years . 
it has a lot of power and looks sleek . 
this peeler is unlike others ,  as it is made in one piece . 
you just cant beat the quality of pyrex . 
they fit great and didnt have any problems with them whil moving around . 
i don t like folgers ,  but the millstone is great . 
kind of like knowing where you ll stop when you hit the brakes . 
i cooked num_num bacon slices in it with no stick . 
we got our oster blender for our wedding num_num years ago . 
you can inadvertently change the time if something touches the buttons also . 
this was a much better price than the breville overpriced option . 
cleans up like a dream  use low heat  . 
it comes with a brush so the mesh is easy to clean . 
still in my top few favorites for headsets . 
it showed no sign of the crack after the food was heated . 
the atlantis has num_num bars to show how much time is left . 
this pitcher is smaller then i wanted but the shape is very sweet . 
thank you amazon . com once again for saving me $
both tools clean up quickly with a hand wash . 
definitely wash in cold water as you can t really afford any shrinkage . 
i d say get the one that feels best to you . 
by far the best protector i have had . 
if you don t peel the garlic the debris comes out quite easily . 
i charged and recharged and only go to blue . 
but the sound of this model bothers me for some reason . 
this is a great deal on a cool product . 
they are the best and made from quality material . 
he uses it on the plane and in his hotel rooms . 
my review still stands ,  this is a wonderful product . 
i fixed it with a crimp of the pliers . 
 sorry again ,  neighbors  . so maybe i m doing something wrong . 
so there s that option i m going to try . 
i love the adjustable blades but the gasket makes it hard to clean . 
the strainers are a perfect size for this task . 
cheap enough you can order several so you can change them out . 
i use this with yogurt from my yogourmet multi electric yogurt maker . 
wow !  i threw out the last of my remaining cheapies . 
you can easily see your reflection without any distortion . 
a very good idea to help protect your bluetooth . 
so i went out and bought tons more smaller mason jars . 
for the price i can live with that . 
the blue plastic pry tool are no use . 
these batteries actually followed me fully charged everywhere i went .

easy connection with the shake and go pairing . 
i use it regularly for bolognese sauce for my lasagna . 
despite the carpeted floor ,  we ve yet to knock the speaker over .

i realized it was time to write a review . 
they are absolutely perfect for the cast iron skillet i purchased . 
 which ,  of course ,  won t work for all teens . 
i have both and the  cheap  one is this benriner . 
i do wish it had a cutout for the charger . 
this mug will take being dropped ,  kicked ,  and crammed into crevices . 
i have small ear canals and was hoping the headset would work . 
it s rock solid and will hold a lot of weight . 
i shook my head violently and the headset hardly budged . 
maybe you overloaded the pitcher ?  i mean some things won t blend . 
there are available extenders; however ,  that will solve that problem . 
so spend the extra money and this case . 
on num_extend able use portable hard drive due to num_extend much strong power . 
it is made from cast aluminum and is still doing a great job . 
true to corelle ,  they are lightweight and break resistant for the clumsy .

it may take some intermediate stirring ,  depending on the dish .

otherwise ,  great set and i m glad i purchased it . 
i have a family and plates get broken if they are breakable . 
both vacuums have great suction and do floor cleaning well .

needed a protector for the back of the iphone num_num i had . 
it is awkward with the raised edges to do this . 
these are an unbelievably good deal and are high quality . 
it can also be used to strain vegetables or pasta . 
found this to be well designed and made with quality . 
it feels great in your hand and has a nice heft . 
also ,  the design of these lids makes them easier to clean . 
the snipping is much easier and cuts more neatly without bruising the herbs . 
the headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud . 
not only this is better than any other grater i have ever owned . 
overall ,  this cable charges great and is inexpensive   :  . 
because we all know the pre bagged kind is the worst for you . 
i use it to charge and iphone and num_extend at the same time .

i am thankful that it has secure connections on it .

i would recomend the rocket fish headset over these . 
brewing stops midway and has to be num_extend
these do everything that fridge magnets do ,  plus they clip things . 
the sound is great but that is subjective . 
the adjustable arm is just too long to be held steady . 
it works great and you can t go wrong with this . 
i bought an additional blade for smaller shredding  grating  . 
overall will still do buisness with this company . 
i paid a lot of money for it . 
i ve had them for about num_num months now . 
i should have bought this before i bought another . 
still a very worthwhile item for big jobs . 
the softer feeling cases stay upright better when using different types of stands . 
sturdy ,  stylish ,  comfortable handles ,  and a good value . 
and they are bulky and noisy even if they do work . 
i even got one for my wife s iphone . 
it is fairly small and doesn t have a temperature dial . 
this is one of the best machines on the market . 
the audio starts to drop out at approximately num_extend
now to get it to florida and see how it handles sweat .

it s well made and very easy to use . 
call quality was supposed to have been improved as well .

isn t there a better finish for hardwood boards ?  . 
i bought this item to use in a spare bedroom . 
this is the best and most useful knife i have ever owned . 
then there is a thermostat knob to adjust the temperature . 
reasonably priced and high quality with the additional pull lock for easy storage . 
i am mystified by how this product can have such drastically variable reviews . 
this plantronics voyager num_num headset didn t have any of these problems . 
bluetooth came packaged as if you were going to hang it on display . 
this is the best case i ve ever seen . 
it s a beautifully designed product with the functionality to match . 
and it is bright red ,  which i like . 
the suction capacity works just great on my low pile carpet . 
was surprised to see that the cutting edge has an etched measuring line . 
this peson has used a different color everyday and loves them .

i used this for my blackberry when i am on the go . 
can t believe just how well the mic works . 
got ridiculously annoying having to keep it charging all the time . 
they are sturdy ,  solid wood ,  a pretty natural cherry stain . 
this gives me the rice consistency and fluffiness that i prefer . 
probably helps to brown the bottom and keeps it from sticking . 
on especially large bags ,  i use two of the clips . 
so ,  i ordered this one using amazon prime giving me free shipping . 
can t beat the price ,  and they work great . 
however when my order arrived ,  two of my goblets were broken . 
i wouldn t hesitate to buy this case again . 
the two different sizes is perfect for corners and circular dough . 
the purpose of screens is to prevent scractches that occur during regular usage .

now i know exactly what s in my ground meats . 
battery life as advertised and charging in very fast . 
no more worries of the hooks coming out of the eye rings . 
the message seems to appear when the battery pack is left on continuously . 
for the price i guess it was worth it . 
i had no problems getting the stains out . 
the last time i owned a stir crazy was over ten years ago . 
it is easy to use and battery life is good . 
great price ,  stick pretty hard to the glass . 
this is my third case for ipod touch . 
i say the same thing about my dvr . 
i use this headset with my playstation num_num and it works well . 
then ,  make sure you have a clean work area free and clean num_extend
anyone who has mixed fruit cake knows how hard it is .

definitely worth the price as well since it s so well made . 
lasts all day even in my wifes phone with her use . 
the accompanying manual or just num_num small sheets were all in korean . 
it does work ok plugged into my computer . 
i only cook stove top this way now .

it was between either this one or the beast one . 
i m a big fan of this ice cream scoop . 
i love lodge cast iron products and own several . 
however for the price they cant be beat . 
i have used these wine stoppers for about num_num months . 
this is a heavy well made bundt pan that conducts heat evenly . 
but it did what it was supposed to . 
they are easy to clean ,  use ,  and store . 
when traveling it is handy for the convenience of being so small . 
some people think the price is a con because it is too much . 
doesn t cut as well as i had hoped though . 
goth this for culinary school and it blows the other graters away . 
so with that being said ,  i love it !  . 
it was a different story pairing it with my ipod . 
it is a substantial material that doesn t feel cheap . 
battery life is above average for an android device . 
have to use towel ,  hot pad ,  or shirt tail . 
the measuring bins doubles as a nice compact storage compartment . 
i will probably get used to the feel of the thing . 
some reviewers griped about the cost of replacing the charcoal water filter . 
another great oxo product easy on the hands . 
do yourself a favor buy this popcorn popper first . 
i have ruined some from water because the motor was attached . 
some of the  studs  fell off ,  but nothing major . 
planned uses are for homemade bacon ,  canadian bacon and pastrami . 
the optimus is a huge improvement over that . 
i tried it on a whim ,  and was pleasantly num_extend
overall i would recommend this screen protector to family and friends too . 
the last you will probably ever need to buy . 
one of my biggest pet peeves is if the picture misrepresents the product . 
this roll is going to last for a looooong time . 
my mom got it first ,  but never used it .

not only is the sound very loud ,  but it s very robust . 
i loved the uniform look when the meat was arranged on the platter . 
they are easy to switch and do a nice job . 
anyways ,  don t let that prevent you from buying this phone . 
great way to dry out your dish towel . 
most have numbers that are too small to read through the oven door . 
i also purchase a henckles num_num inch paring same time . 
although ,  i think i remember ordering the blue and got the red . 
my rack is num_num years old and these fit perfectly . 
it will store the item without any spillage . 
that is most common use with pain problems . 
why spend more for great espresso or cappachino ?  . 
i bought this salad spinner when the one i purchased at target broke .

i fell in love with this case the second i saw it . 
i use this knife solely for fruits and vegetables . 
doesn t quite work as the handle gets hot about half way up . 
the cutouts give good access to all ports . 
the desired time is easy to set up and stop . 
i shopped the internet ,  and once again amazon had the best price . 
we used it the day we received it and it was fantastic . 
i set something on it one day and the dial wouldn t move . 
not sure what else can be said about it . 
unfortunately ,  these were a bit too small for what i had intended . 
at first when i received the usb cables they didn t work . 
they all fit the incredibles as they are intended . 
they enjoyed being able to see it iwhile the ice cream was making . 
it is fine for what it s made for . 
the bristles have not bent or fallen out . 
it is a good quality bookcase at a reasonable price . 
the difference in quality comes from the steel used and the manufacturing process . 
also ,  the plastic seems to be a slightly heavier gauge than mine . 
this makes the unit fit tighter and reduces background noise . 
leave the stamped steel knives to the newlyweds . 
lodge has always made a high quality skillet . 
however ,  the earhooks may actually be less flexible than the sock hangers .

the easily to break ear hooks have been replaced . 
the box was a bit mussed up ,  but nothing was damaged inside . 
i mostly use it to puree veggies ,  cooked and raw . 
but all in all though ,  it is a great product . 
i worked but was harder and harder to use as it became dull . 
after so much use it will need to be replaced . 
in other words ,  you can only hear phone conversations .

careful when stirring not to tear the hot liner . 
this battery as my main almost doubles my usage time .

headphones suck ,  but not as bad as apple s . 
you are directed to their website for detailed instructions .

safer than wood or bamboo and no shellac flaking off in my mouth .

make sure that you read the instructions on cleaning and assembly . 
i haven t used my stove or oven in num_num months .

the face of the earpiece is sensitive to touch .

still fully charging my iphone when it runs out of batteries .

took forever to find a coffee maker i might be happy with . 
use a large bowl it pops fast and lots . 
the portable charger is a feature that is beyond the ordinary . 
get your fingers wet ,  screen wet and the screen protector wet . 
it does a great job and it couldn t be easier to clean . 
purchased these as part of my wife s christmas . 
this caddy is extremely well made of heavy duty acrylic . 
does a great job giving out fresh water from the sink . 
still have to open door because of smoke though . 
you can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard . 
great buy ,  waiting to buy another by this company !  !  !  . 
i am really excited about my new tool . 
you don t even need an measuring cup . clean up is easy . 
before purchasing them my cabinet was a wreck . 
i ordered the horizontal leather iphone case indicated here . 
coffee is well ground in no time and unit cleans easy . 
the suction is strong enough to pick up hair and bigger pieces . 
this was the perfect solution for my pantry . 
i was amazed at how much dirt was in my carpets . 
kaz consumer service was very helpful in explaining this . 
and i must say that i love this decanter . 
i wish this came as a set of all three sizes . 
thanks to all who took the time to do the reviews . 
replaces one of those crummy baskets that hang off the shower head . 
the first for me and now my wife . 
it s not that bad since you will have the cables anyway . 
mine has taken extreme heat without any problems . 
yes ,  we have ac ,  but call us old school . 
i ll probably buy some of the  jumbo  fiesta mugs to replace these . 
for those of you that don t think about anyone but yourself . 
this is the perfect basic ice pick that i was searching for . 
i like it very much and am very glad i ordered it . 
it is so old that the rubber feet disintegrated . 
the only noticeable difference is the slight color variation from the old one . 
it is my favorite out of all the cutting boards i have tried . 
i really like the small ,  compact ,  size of this device . 
gave this as a gift to my daughter in law . 
people have complained that it doesn t come with enough white shelf pieces . 
the handle is pretty bulky so it s easy to hang on to . 
i bought this for my wife for christmas and she loves it . 
they are a more substantial thickness ,  yet still allow flexing . 
a great buy in the line of kitchen appliances . 
it bakes the pizzelles just fine even without that clip . 
l crippled after using num_num gigs on iphone num_extend
i do like this board for its size . 
i hope new trent addresses this in a future version . 
i store all my crackers in one jar and cookies in the other . 
i keep my splenda in this container ,  and i love it . 
going on num_num years now with this great set !  . 
seller shipped the item quickly and it was as advertised . 
if you want just one broccoli crown steamed ,  it s perfect . 
it s a generous size for you big pots and pans . 
the pocket is nice and can certainly hold a few credit cards etc . 
just follow the recipe on the bag using the white rice cycle . 
i m enjoying this large tray very much and it is so beautiful . 
these are as easy to clean as any other whisk . 
this is a good size for my oven . 
returned this item ,  as it was ordered in error . 
could not ask for a better set of earpieces . 
just quit trying other complicated methods ,  both consumers and manufacturers . 
this type warranty doesn t seem to me to be of any value . 
this was perfect for the wedding cake i created . 
always have spares when you re doing a cake or major decorating project . 
the difference for most devices is going to be the charge rate . 
easy to use and clean ,  nice size handle easy to grip . 
pros fits tighly ,  provides great protection from dropping the phone . 
it brews the coffee right into the travel mug . 
it arrived fast and the service was excellent . 
due to the type of work we do . 
bluetooth headsets have finally fulfilled the promise of easy wireless accessories . 
i do believe this is a handmade case . 
i love the way the hose just pops out . 
using it in an application like this would take forever . 
it s very satisfying to see how the water changes as you clean . 
so ,  i went looking for one of my own . 
besides egg and hush brown ,  i hardly have  sticky  pan problem . 
was very easy to do and works great !  thanks a bunch !  . 
touchflo works well and don t crash at num_extend
i decided to purchase one and enjoy making some comfort foods for myself . 
i ve been very pleased with it for that purpose !  . 
she said it was great ,  and she used it all the time . 
highly rated from cook illustrated so i decided to buy some quality knives . 
worked perfectly on both phones i tried it on . 
this worked fine for me making coldpress coffee at home . 
reasonably quick charge of the product considering the large capacity . 
the bags work fine but the machine has crapped out after several months . 
sturdy and good norpro quality ,  this will last for years . 
it slices down through the hardest frozen ice cream with no difficulty . 
wish i had just gone with this to begin with . 
i use the bags of jolly time purchased at my local supermarket . 
my dehydrator came with only two of these . 
you will actually smile when you hit switch . 
i was ready to slam the storm against a brick wall . 
i ve tried practically every type of coffee making system except the keurig . 
i currently use this for my whole house telephone system . 
it is really nice and easy to use . 
decided to get the middle unit  the num_extend
cheap and reliable way to not scald the milk for your cappuccino . 
it looks identical to the item pictured here . 
i have never had this happen to me . 
i ve tried motorola ,  jawbone ,  plantronics and other jabras . 
the sound quality is pretty good and thus i ve purchased num_num more . 
i have got to buy more so i can hang up my wheelbarrow . 
i also used mine for a custom dash mount for my cars console . 
i would always have to remove my food just cut it . 
it fits perfectly over the eyes of my stove . 
i would suggest anyone buying to read the instruction manual front to back . 
it worked perfectly fine for the htc evo num_extend
i bought this after seeing it on america s test kitchen . 
before the purifiers that was a daily thing . 
does a great job cleaning the floors when i do them . 
this product is silky smooth on touch screens . 
the num_num star reviews are correct :  this thing makes fantastic popcorn . 
having a balanced knife makes proper use of it much easier . 
bought this for the superbowl for bbq d little smokies . 
fill within one inch from the top and keep that space clean . 
the silent ringer function exists in other places in the phone . 
it s tough to beat black num_extend greater heat sensitivity . 
i hadn t even dreamed of such a thing . 
you have to look for them when they re on sale . 
they fitted on my ipad perfectly and on my sister s iphone . 
if you re looking for bluetooth headphones get these . 
much better quality than available in the mall  or on the street  . 
just remember to make sure you need only the glass screen . 
i now have three of these ,  two large and one small . 
do not contact the nonstick surface with metal ,  ceramic ,  or glass . 
charges you apple product for your cars butt lighter . 
she has long nails and has trouble using the touch screen . 
this garlic peeler does exactly what it s supposed to do . 
lightweight so it works for smaller cuts too . 
red is a cheery color in the kitchen . 
this is a very useful item . an epicurean bon appetite . 
it still closes ,  but with a little work . 
it does take up a lot of counter space ,  however . 
if you need something larger ,  get a larger one . 
they are great and pretty much as advertised . 
i considered it a small investment in a new unit . 
they have every size i could ever see needing for making cookies . 
i like the alternative flat and glossy sheen on the handles . 
i must say ,  i have not been disappointed . 
i love how there are more than one that came as well . 
this charger is a diamond in the rough . 
u can t contact support  ,  the emails don t go through . 
it s easy to blast yourself when trying a small adjustment . 
these are easy to control without hunting around for the controls . 
saved me from having to buy num_num separate car chargers . 
what s not to like ?  no more burned fingers . 
it is easy and does not take alot of effort . 
the handles are solid and well made so far . 
i was very pleased to receive this tpu case for the iphone num_extend
but being cheap that was maybe a month . 
great quality ,  and perfect for all straining ,  washing vegetables or fruit . 
that way you get a smoother less crystalized texture . 
very simple layout and easy to understand operation . 
one is in a bedroom and one is in my guest bath . 
but with num_extend this is a powerhouse for the price . 
only negative was the high shipping cost more than item . 
this small one was my most recent purchase . 
nice ! it stays in my ear and feels secure . 
bought this for my wife over a year ago . 
this roller works great to roll out pizza dough right on the pan . 
i purchased this one and she loves it . 
what can i say ,  it works as advertised with no issues . 
i didn t wnat the evo to get too fat . 
that s the day i figured out that it unscrews from the shaft . 
this charger is exactly like the one that came with my phone . 
i have a samsung mesmerize and the cover fits great . 
so you re not going to make ice cream at the last minute . 
i love the clear canisters so i know what is in each one . 
these are very sharp and grate without mashing the food . 
hinge is made well and does not keep old food . 
this is disappointing because the headset is already very expensive . 
i can wash the filter ,  don t have to buy new ones . 
result was considerably drier in texture with nearly zero carrot taste . 
i have mine set on fine grind ,  but it is adjustable . 
i just made my first cake in this pan . 
this is one sturdy ,  compact hard working unit . 
daughter picked this case out for her phone . 
worked hard on applying it but never got all the bubbles out . 
it only takes up about % of an english muffin . 
just like cloth potholders ,  this sleeve is only heat protective when dry . 
one of the three was defective and broke when i first used it . 
our kitchen knives were pretty dull after about a year of use . 
had this for years and not a single stain or crack or chip . 
depending ,  of course ,  on your own sense of num_extend
i m fine with that and like the sticker price . 
really not a big deal in my opinion . 
you can also use these to leave your knives loose in a drawer . 
check with your phone but doesn t work on all phones . 
i purchased it after reading reviews on it and a few others . 
it doesn t slide around and sits very sturdy in my sink . 
i use this for my jacuzzi and absolutely love it . 
decent case for the price ,  nothing spectacular but nice and clear . 
one missing thing compared to the competition is the lack of volume control . 
there is no way anyone could possibly be disappointed with this . 
love these because they are very durable and work well in my kitchen . 
god . a perfect cup of coffee on my second try . 
the only drawback is you get num_num forks and only num_num crackers . 
i quickly saw the light and purchased a mill some num_num years ago . 
and i guess i need to type four more useless words . 
it like it because it takes up so little space . 
filling is squeezed into pockets and edges sealed . 
i really like the diamond pattern on the back . 
very well crafted ,  you will not be disappointed with this purchase . 
they are either lame or are not reading the instruction booklet . 
the first night we got this ,  we made funnel cakes . 
this holster fits the bill ,  and came as described by the seller . 
they work for their purpose so ,  i would recommend this product . 
i bought this to make fresh food for my cats . 
i needed a tree mug to hold my fiesta num_num oz mugs . 
the clip on the back is very sturdy and strong . 
when used upright ,  the iphone tilts the stand over . 
i hated the tangling and this is a good solution . 
i received this grinder a few days ago and have used it twice . 
i still use this sharpener fairly regularly ,  it still works great . 
has great suction and the carpet setting is great . 
they are a perfect replacement for the oem part . 
a must have for any one that cooks . 
overall the case is nice and worth the purchase price . 
my husband purchased this for me based upon it s reviews . 
well ,  if you want the ultimate in comfort ,  look no further . 
it is a keeper ,  feels solid and durable . 
i bought this one after looking through the various options on amazon . 
since microwaves vary ,  you have to experiment there . 
but i agree that it s a perfect size for serving small portions . 
she said this vaccuum is very light and fits great in one hand . 
this apple corer is awesome and very high quality . 
it s creates too fine of a product for cheese . 
my pressure cooker of num_num years got damaged in my last move . 
she s dropped num_num phones in num_num months and them broke . 
i would certainly get the adjustable rocker weight gauge as an accessory . 
i love it and the colors are great too . 
this is real glass ,  which has advantages and disadvantages . 
so i ordered the coated ones for this machine . 
i love colors ,  and these are so cool . 
i purposely bought this one after reading and trusting the reviews . 
i just with they were half this price . 
plus you make a lot in each batch . 
for smart phones ,  that is ! the call quality is great . 
if you love your ball jars you will love these . 
it s great for all sorts of jobs and is durable . 
metal would have been better ,  but it seems to be pretty durable . 
i read all the reviews ,  then took the plunge . 
im going to try it out for a while and give an update . 
i use the dx one handed but i have big hands . 
my review in num_num indicated i had the product for over a year . 
these pans have been very good for me . 
very aesy to remove and replace phone on the fly . 
the product looks great .  .  . sleek and shiny ,  nice design . 
wow !  the hot chocolate taste even better then before . 
so far so good ,  nothing would get stuck on this thing . 
finally they are hidden nicely in the closet . 
it s wonderful ! i can now make my own cappuccinos at home . 
it is very convenient to be able to open the side when loading . 
i bought a set of these for my mom for mother s day . 
closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan . 
easy to connect to my droid incredible each and everytime . 
that s the only drawback to having the centered lever arm . 
go ahead and get this case if you have the white samsung galaxy num_extend
just know that all multiple holes will go inward . 
time will tell ,  but so far so good . 
this is a great cooling rack for bakers or cooks . 
as several other reviewers have written ,  the magnet is useless . 
i m the only one who drinks coffee in our house . 
wait a bit until the pan is hot ,  then add your ingredients . 
worried it will be one of those gadgets that will disappear . 
i will update on the cover as time goes by . 
if i wanted to use a tablet i would . 
after two weeks of using the purifier i like it a lot . 
this sharpener does not work with a thick blade . 
i love how i can julienne my veggies with such ease . 
the only thing missing is the outdoor cooking experience . 
she learned how to use it in no time and loves it . 
i purchased it for my samsung galaxy note num_extend and it works well . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
add another manufacturer s screen protector and you re golden . 
it looks exactly like the picture on this site . 
the fry basket leaves a bit to be desired . 
i cannot exercise without the earset for two weeks . 
i expect it will last for a few decades at least . 
in addition there was an empty bag for another set of ear buds . 
normally i just keep my headset in a shirt pocket . 
and the sprint epic num_extend touch is huge . 
i am asian and rice is my primary meal . 
this is a product i will remember for many years to come . 
i am really impressed with the battery life . 
it came quickly and the directions were great for putting it together . 
so i ordered one for my bedroom and was very pleased . 
we were making popcorn on a wood stove using a pan . 
we waited a few days and finally gave up and ordered this replacement . 
not entirely sure if the lower half is water proof . 
i broke out the good ole balloon whisk and got to work . 
this item was delivered in just a couple of days . 
the only complaint that i ve seen is that it s noisy . 
don t buy it here though ,  target sells it for $ or $
it does not have a lid and does not have loop handles . 
works well and makes a heck of a good cup of coffee . 
i am actually sitting typing this listening to some petty . 
you wont find a better set for the money . 
still performs its task without any other issues . 
we live in a primarily price sensitive marketing environment . 
i like it and the color helps it to stand out . 
i would buy this again and i highly recommend it . 
this popcorn maker pops almost all the kernels . 
the outer ceramic piece slides into slots on the side . 
there is no need to carry a mirror . 
it also slides in and out of pockets easily . 
it does all you want it to do with minimal fuss . 
the name fido in the title threw me . 
we have other pots like this and they are just as good . 
they do jab down into the meat perfectly well though . 
i have them everywhere ,  my boat ,  my truck ,  my num_extend
it s easy to use and the coffee is great . 
 i imagine based on other reviews that she had her own recipe  . 
very nice if you work outside or where it could easily get damaged . 
this water goblet is really pretty and feels good in your hand . 
i ve had some experience in the past with these protective covers . 
mom was always buying the chickens at the grocery store for her recipes . 
my one complaint would be that the cord is much too short . 
has a little melter container on top also . 
the alarm lets me know when the target temperature is reached . 
the quality of the product is second to none . 
it can be folded in usual times for your convenience . 
i tried this one and it works just as well . 
so i usually take it out to close it . 
we had another krups one that i dropped and needed to replace it . 
the popcorn is nice and fluffy without oil and calories . 
this one is great to fill in that need . 
even better is that it doesnt weigh anything . 
i have a small brush to clean the bowl . 
no more running out at the least opportunr moment . 
i haven t personally used one yet ,  but look forward to . 
i don t think anyone will be sorry for buying this can opener . 
i bought one for each of my family members . 
charging for this headset was by usb only . 
they are still great ,  and almost like new . 
cleans easy ,  not a heavy thing like le creuset . 
pairing was also a breeze with the voice recognition . 
all parts were labelled and the pilot holes were all accurately drilled . 
it is a beautiful piece of solid art and technology like no other . 
i look for excuses to get out my dyson . 
we had fiskars ,  and they refused to cut certain things . 
of course the dishes are solid fiesta quality . 
i recently bought mine in  tangerine orange  for about $
had some of these already but needed a few more . 
i wondered if this spatula was as good as people said . 
this is the way professional slicers are made . 
num_num stars because i haven t used it yet . 
i ve only tried it with a flash drive but it works great . 
doesn t move around and has a real glass jar . 
well ,  i weighed a cup from these and it was num_extend oz . 
really like the functionality of this phone and the perfectly sized display . 
just wish it were louder and that the battery was replaceable . 
feel safer in case of break ins too . 
stable and easy to move if not needed . 
only took seconds to reduce the seeds to almost powder . 
but so far so good; no signs of problems . 
these do and they can go from microwave to table to dishwasher . 
for most people this block will probably work well . 
you ll hear instruments you didn t know were in your favorite songs . 
pans of similar price are not as high quality . 
they used to put these nicer attachments with the mixer years ago . 
we put the highest setting on before bedtime stories are read . 
they re pretty much all i use at this point . 
now my phone works like it is new . 
nice long handle but mine is rusting a little . 
then i will place my new pot there for next year s july . 
i am making more steak cause of this tenderizer . 
i like the fact that bamboo is a sustainable product . 
everyone asks where i got this and i just say amazon . 
the mixer itself shows no signs of wear at all . 
but still the best solution out there imho . 
this lever sticks out to far for the product to work . 
i did have to replace the cutting blade inside . 
it feel nice and durable in the hands and transfers heat well . 
toaster has a timless look ,  goes with most any motif s . 
it can get a little dirty ,  but ,  oh well . 
this sturdy little canner is wonderful for those mini harvest days . 
i ve been looking for a cooker like this for a long time . 
still i give it num_num stars because the pan itself is great . 
seemed to break after a couple of years . 
the charger works in the way it should work . 
doesn t add much bulk to the phone either . 
i love the quilted mitt that comes with the kettle . 
excellent quality ,  and the extra handle helps because skillets are heavy . 
this knife is perfect for slicing soft cheeses like brie and fresh mozzarella . 
though i do feel bodum should look into that themselves . 
this bag is essential for your delicate clothing items . 
kinetic scrolling ,  variable zoom ,  and quite a speed improvement . 
she gave me two cast iron pans that was her mothers . 
i love it and buying another one for a friend as a gift . 
this thing came in bigger than i thought . 
we love the discs and the bread blade . 
you can also save with a brita and a lexan water bottle . 
purchased right before a week long business trip . 
this made it sooo easy !  it s crazy how simple it is . 
the nonstick looks like it will hold up well . 
i particularly like it for thinly and evenly slicing small cloves of garlic . 
saw there was a lot of negative reviews for these things . 
i bought these to make homemade english muffins and they are perfect . 
makes it easy to use and stays on tight . 
so i decided to give it a try . 
there isn t a way to open the beater bar and clean it . 
this filter is a life saver for my hard water . 
a little lighter than expected but still a good knife for the money . 
my husband and i both like to sleep with lots of white noise . 
it spins well and really gets the water off . 
other than that ,  i haven t had any troubles using them . 
i found that it worked erratically ,  but was useful enough . 
it heats up very quickly and does an excellent job . 
the build quality on the phone is both good and bad . 
i guess it s all about presentation and taste . 
i have another brand that work well just started using it for spices . 
i love it and only wish i had gotten it a lot sooner . 
this charger woks wonderfully on the samsung galaxy num_extend
great product like all the other otterbox products i have . 
it doesnt go bad ,  but loses all its flavors . 
throughout the years my flutes have gotten broken . 
this proved to be a very simple screen protector to install . 
too bad i do not have this phone anymore . 
wipe the grounds off the top grinding element with the enclosed small brush . 
the ear piece is adjustable and fits any users head and ear . 
amazon kindle :  read all content on your kindle ,  also on your num_extend
the invisible walls to keep roomba in a certain area is a plus . 
num_extend it leaks and will have to be replaced . 
i also order one in red and bow are cool . 
the pink and chrome detail are very elegant looking . 
camera works fine ,  sensors work fine ,  volume buttons work fine . 
no dangling wires that interfere with any task at hand . 
what a bargain . this is my second bluetooth headset . 
i also learned to use the sharpening steel to finish the job . 
i let them dry and it goes back looking brand new . 
the handle however is not too comfy to hold . 
the quality is built in and the performance really satisfies her . 
however it s too weak to be felt while you re driving . 
i got this little machine when it first came on the market . 
i use this to charge my iphone num_extend in my car . 
but again the white just gets dirty sooooo fast num_extend
it paired quickly and easily to my phone ,  with voice prompts . 
i just wanted a nice clean look for my new bathroom . 
but it did wake me up to tell me that . 
easier to use than a regular knife or a pastry knife . 
there are two things that could be improved . 
this is not affecting the performance at all ,  only the appearance . 
one button turns it on and zeroes it out . 
i like baked potatoes ,  but hate heating the kitchen to do so . 
for an affordable price ,  no complaint about it . 
i like the size as it is good for pastries and stuff . 
i have been familiar with cast iron pans since i was a child . 
it is very light with a pretty design . 
it s easy to put on and protects very well . 
 :  i would definiely reccomend this to even a novice baker . 
this pan looks like it will make a wider loaf . 
being a micro b usb it will work with almost any smart phone . 
great entertainment for my num_num year old too . 
but for the price you will not find better . 
it is very costly to just buy another lid . 
it rests on the rim of the pot . 
i also like the looks and feel of the case better . 
replace the gasket regularly and the jar base should last longer . 
much less expensive to order these in the num_num pack . 
now they ve very stiff and difficult to use . 
some reviewers have complained about the suction cups . 
also ,  take care that this pan is not to big for you . 
i will never need to buy another one of these again . 
i wish i had this a long time ago . 
i am glad i chose the cucina pro . 
love this !  we d borrowed something similar in the past . 
i really did not expect this cable to be much . 
if possible keep cup covered during this time to maintain temperature . 
i bought a bunch of these when they were $ each . 
def a nice case ,  thick rubber not thin n flimsy like most . 
i am able to fit pairs of heals or sneakers in each compartment . 
i got this as a gift for christmas and absolutely love it . 
this rack is very stable and should last a lifetime . 
i used cup of batter and lifted the lid slightly . 
it doesn t stretch out like most cases of this material . 
these blade savers are high quality and reasonably priced . 
this is the best price on the net . 
who cares so you have to empty it between num_extend
i use it all the time and i love it . 
figured my gadget draw was not the place for it . 
what s not to like ?  it is a simple small porcelain mortal . 
tap that ,  and you ll get a prompt to  mount  the phone . 
will update once i receive the new item ! update num_extend march num_extend
it s  working great and i ve never had any issues with it . 
i was hesitant to buy this machine ,  reading the reviews and all . 
it would not work over my washer because of the hoses . 
i ve had mine for a year and it works perfectly . 
these glasses are just perfect !  they are beautifully made and not heavy . 
it does not cover much of the screen which is a plus . 
this has not happened yet but who knows when it might . 
would recommend to anyone that cooks with dutch ovens . 
pops most kernals ,  a bit sensative at first . 
num_extend was poor ,  too ,  but better than this . 
this product is typical high quality oxo good grips . 
it is extremely sturdy and works well with my glass stovetop . 
now granted ,  my num_num year old daughter did go through her minutes . 
i certainly beats the damage my phone has taken in the past . 
still locked ,  still in one piece ,  lid still closes . 
we got our mixer used and it did not have all the attachments . 
could not get it towork as bluetooth num_extend
i didn t know this product existed until i got on amazon . 
but once on u will be satisfied and proud . 
overall it is well designed and has exceeded my expectations . 
but then i found this one ,  and it s perfect . 
the battery level went from % full charge to no charge at all . 
i keep this thermos mug on my desk at work . 
i like the shape of the cups very much . 
the batteries themselves are great and hold a charge for quite some time . 
this is the reason i took off one star . 
it s a great blender ,  and i really do love it . 
since it s adhesive ,  you can put it anywhere . 
it provides even heatfor all of my experiments . 
all of the cutouts line up well on my num_extend  att  . 
this is a great product and very pleasing to view as well . 
i wish the display were backlit and a little larger . 
placing a cold stone in a hot oven will crack it . 
normally i am a big fan of leaving the wine in the bottle . 
the blade is as sharp as surgical blades ,  so be careful . 
i have no problems with the food sticking . 
eventually the blade breaks off of the handle . 
i compared this one to a store bought charger and it was identical . 
i just wish it had a range beyond num_num feet from the booster . 
i hope it will stay there and perform well . 
i like this knife and would buy more of this brand . 
a little shallow for soups but it work for that also . 
i need to replace it because it s distracting . 
my thanksgiving cakes were a disaster but the christmas ones were magnificent . 
it s a very sturdy ,  well made ,  solid wood stool . 
product generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review . 
after that it just stayed in my car . 
works great for heavy duty candy making for the wife on holidays especially . 
there is nothing better than drinking from a glass container . 
there is an optional container for grinding num_extend
when one wears out or breaks ,  i buy another . 
it is a great single cup coffee maker . 
it grinds the coffee beans very well and quickly . 
and being in the $ dollar range seems about right for this product . 
now i can t wait to take it to some holiday functions . 
it feels like it will fall out ,  but it hasn t yet . 
take a marker and draw the outline of your board onto the felt . 
we have a number of apple touch and iphone devices in my family . 
i have used the charger itself and it charges my phone really fast . 
so much fun during the summer !  my kids were thrilled !  ;  . 
i anticipate years of baking with this pan . 
but i knew what i was buying when i bought it . 
i will be definitely be getting another one . 
it came with a genuine wall charger ,  not a horrible aftermarket one . 
first ,  in the box ,  you don t get a whole lot . 
i ordered this case after buying a similar one for a different phone . 
its easy to use and easy to store . 
the recipes that come with it are very limited . 
my cakes look so beautiful and the details is nothing but beautiful . 
the seller had this on my doorstep in less than a week . 
it is a must have in every kitchen . 
it looks brand spanking new in every way . 
first time i don t like something i bought at amazon . 
in my neck of the woods that s usually ,  early num_extend
i am happy with this charger and it was a good price . 
i have owned this pot for less than a year . 
i used it to measure spaghetti for one to test it . 
works well with the ipone num_num and iphone num_extend
i find these invaluable under homemade pound cakes . 
i got these for the num_num satellite speakers in my home entertainment system . 
the handle is plenty big enough and the glass is nice and heavy . 
i can heat up the water ,  and walk away without worrying . 
living in the country means specialty items are just not available . 
and then there are all the papers and books ,  magazines and catalogs . 
love the sharp teeth on this . fabulous for making limeade . 
but they are dishwasher ,  oven and microwave safe . 
other than that i am happy with this purchase . 
it feels light and flimsy but works good . 
i took this phone case on spring break with me . 
she loves the compartments for her id ,  credit card ,  and money . 
this is a quality product and i just love it . 
these are very heavy feeling ,  nice looking glasses . 
if you re new to android ,  this will take getting used to . 
it s quieter than the old salt and ice type . 
i use a juicer several times a week and this jug is great . 
it comes with an eye remover on the side . 
it is not shaped or sized like a turner . 
it feels smooth and sturdy to the touch . 
love this case and would buy it again . 
to turn off you don t pull and bend ,  you just bend . 
i will add another review in a year or so . 
i use any mug i ve got within reach without any problems . 
this screen protector adds a nice amount of privacy to your phone . 
i like that it is glass and not plastic . 
the battery lasts over num_num hours of heavy use . 
the price was spot on for buying a back up . 
i definitely end up using it more than i thought . 
this is a slow cooker not a crock pot . 
but now that i carry my juice pack with me . 
i placed the order and had the filter in two days . 
it has to be scrubbed to remove a coating that comes on it . 
it does what it is intended to do . 
also very easy to assemble and take apart . 
you can even bake cakes and make jam in it if you want . 
this really works in popping popcorn without oil . 
recently purchased toddy maker and bought this extra package of stoppers . 
i use it all the time even when home . 
the block also had extra spaces for other knives you may have . 
i like it if i have any problems i will update you . 
this case fits my note ii perfectly . i would recommend this case . 
it is also the only grater i have tried that does rachellte . 
just set over the coffee cup and pour slowly . 
works for any of your boiled water needs . 
i appreciated the generous area for adding ingredients . 
ive always purchased elago cases they are my favorite . 
it was appreciated by him and well used . 
i thought i was hopeless ,  until that one faithful morning . 
so these little stylus  are convient for me . 
friends and family should expect spectacular holiday cookies and cakes this year . 
wetting the filter is always a good idea . 
i m glad i was finally able to find a pot like this . 
it didn t walk around ,  and it was easy to use . 
they are cute and seem to work well . 
i ordered this and am so very happy that i did . 
the shipping was about what you would expect from usps num_extend days  . 
it s very light and sharp . great quality and very useful . 
the meelectronics is pretty big and will fall off if take it running . 
it is a good size for most applications and seems sturdy . 
you just can t beat lodge cast iron at all . 
i think all large chute machine have some variation of this safety interlock . 
the cord is finally long enough to do most of the house . 
very sterdy and fits on almost any air vent . 
i love it and will buy another for backup . 
i ve yet to use it for heavier batters such as bread . 
otherwise it works fine and the coffee is goood . 
i put them both on so my curtain will slide nicely . 
i suppose you could use it for human stuff as well . 
i did not expect it to be so useful . 
wish i would have known about them years ago !  . 
these style num_num hepa filters are made to the brissell design specs . 
they are a pain to seperate but nobody makes anything better . 
the controls are the complete opposite ,  which is odd to me . 
i m surprised how useful it turned out to be . 
now ,  i hope this unit provides many years of service . 
it s light weight and feels good on the iphone . 
the price is low and it is a great bargain . 
not very practical but it is a fun case . 
loved it so much i recently bought another one . 
not enough reasons to upgrade for num_extend owners . 
we use this griddle everyday for breakfast and for some meats and shrimp . 
once i was done ,  i was very impressed . 
between droid and galaxy company s better keep making these . 
i have never experienced any unpleasant smell from the unit at all . 
three and a half minutes was good enough for my machine . 
it does charge while the phone is on . 
i found this on amazon and thought i would buy it . 
you do have to remove the bottom part to charge . 
i made my purchase of these casserole dishes in num_extend
the price was cheap ,  the case fit good . 
i am very impressed with the quality of this knife set . 
they came packaged flat and stay flat and they are a good thickness . 
seabreeze replaced the mounting piece after a phone call . 
i m on my num_extend grill because these grills are great . 
wish we had bought it a long time ago . 
i couldn t find a larger one to test max size . 
highly recommend this product for its quality and its price . 
even if you cook only occasionally ,  this is a knife for you . 
i found this wok very easy to prep and season . 
i think they are the best types for protection and grip . 
i have owned over a dozen different models of bluetooh headsets . 
they offer a variety of sizes and knife styles . 
this can be used for any phone because if has a usb port . 
it s so easy and so much cheaper than others on the market . 
my mother loves it and so do i . 
that dust sensor never detects dust when i vac with the dyson . 
this works fabulously on a totally smooth metalic surface . 
i used it for watermelons for our bbq . 
after seeing this ,  i figured i d give it a try . 
i would highly recommend the dish drainer though . 
i sure hope the product is really new . 
it needs to stay black and shiny inside to stay seasoned . 
took num_num star off simply due to price . 
i find it cooks as consistently as my other slow cookers . 
as a southern cook ,  cast iron is essential in my kitchen . 
and at such a low price ,  how can you go wrong ?  . 
do not have to say she was delighted . 
the phone would lock up about every num_num or num_num days . 
this was a gift to my daughter for grinding spices . 
it s worth a shot ,  and not too expensive . 
lets me plug my usb devices into my galaxy nexus . 
i always hand washed it due to being a wood product . 
they are just wide enough for most snack bags these days . 
i would recommend to a friend and would buy again . 
this color is a really great blue color . 
our old cuisinart food processor came with num_num discs and num_num blades . 
we found the product quite satisfactory and confidently recommend it . 
and i can t get navi to work for me . 
at first it seemed strange because it talks to you . 
the best thing is that it takes very little space to store . 
this coffee maker does what it says it will do . 
thank you so much for the small size it works fantastically . 
the lid of my machine seems fine ,  no problems . 
plus the magnet is strong enough to stay on the fridge or stove . 
finally found a sprayer that fits my weird faucet . 
i m glad i didn t have to worry about that . 
we were starting to have issues with our galaxy num_extend keeping their charge . 
there is only one thing i don t like . 
 this is best done when the pan is still hot  . 
received it in good time ,  just as it appears in the picture . 
i don t use it often ,  but i love muffin tops . 
they are the first bowls i reach for ,  every time . 
this is the second casecrown iphone case that i have purchased . 
well ,  i do use plastic utensils on it . 
the eggs cook fabulously and slide right out of the pan . 
i also use skinomi tech skins on my devices . 
despite the thanksgiving holiday ,  the item was shipped and received quickly . 
this product its great because it looks elegant and its strong . 
to begin with it is easy to hold . 
salmon steaks and regular steaks take less than num_num minutes and taste fantastic . 
i love this ,  i cook everything with it . 
it s slim and makes the iphone fit well in your hand . 
would have loved an easily removable top platen for cleaning . 
i was grating carrots and the carrot got stuck . 
i am not sure how well it works because it was a gift . 
i have had it in my truck for months and months . 
i use this all the time ,  would buy again . 
it is easy to use and clean up is also easy . 
i try not to eat to much bread for health reasons . 
this is the only area that the num_extend beats everyone else . 
i understand if a longer cord is needed ,  it can be purchased . 
much better success got me than using a steel ,  or electric . 
i would have preferred another row of keys . 
i just ordered the cream and sugar set to go with it . 
this is the best can opener i have ever used . 
the touch screen portion still functions as usual . 
i put the juice of one per bag . 
this drives the screw into the cork for you . 
it s smaller than my old juicer ,  which is nice ,  mostly . 
you have to go to options and open dialer to enter this . 
i got these for my groomsmen and had them engraved . 
this is the next best thing to sliced bread . 
there is only one paper seal to break . 
my mother loved my first one so much she took it . 
this case fits the aux cable perfectly without having to remove the case . 
i had a smaller one and it was always a problem . 
we bought these hoping to keep supper warm . 
you plug it in and the phone gets power . 
what more can you say about a case . 
they are indispensable for the blender i bought . 
with the screen on you see none of this . 
my nordic ware still looks brand new and i use it a lot . 
i use a small amount of oil and add seasonings of my choice . 
i have the curve and my husband has the tour . 
having compared the two ,  i d never buy a larger glass carafe . 
i use it mostly for sketching and drawing . 
the inside is clearly marked . i got an excellent price thru amazon . 
it works just fine and has been for over a year now . 
i ve gone quite a distance but not a full num_num feet . 
the extra few bucks was great for peace of mind . 
it is the best i have used over the years . 
it s not gel soft ,  but not rockhard either . 
really nice for a quick breakfast or snack . 
we use the oven mostly for reheating and melting . 
my spaghetti used to slide off my dinner plates . 
the zuchini has to be ripe but not overly num_extend
this works way better ,  is cheaper and lasts longer . 
they are inexpensive and work as good as the original did when new . 
it works perfectly when grinding delicate items like herbs ,  too . 
you can t go wrong with the greatshield ultra smooth . 
perfect for stylish storage of bulk rice and flower . 
easy to clean and stack nicely for the cupboard . 
my one complaint is that the iron rest is pretty much useless . 
when i purchased this headset ,  i was skeptical . 
might have to get something different when i start running though . 
got a new phone and dont use these any more . 
i also use them when i  set up  mango jam for the year . 
i needed replacement pads because of use and washing them . 
it also gives you the confidence to roll thinner dough . 
get this quickly since this line is being discontinued . 
makes a great gift for someone just moving in somewhere . 
the matte finish also means no messy finger prints !  . 
my husband was very impressed with both items . 
i found it can handle exactly num_num tablespoons of grounds . 
i put it around my neck when i go for a walk . 
the rug stair adapter hose is a trick t hook the first num_extend
two things are annoying ,  hence num_num stars instead of num_extend
this one came only lasting half a day . 
mixing clear and frosted materials looks really cool . 
please read them  both the editorial review and reviews from other users  . 
unlike calphalon cookware ,  it can go in the dishwasher . 
i have tried half a dozen or more car mounts for my iphone num_extend
i haven t had any issues with it so far . 
it is elegant ,  highly functional ,  and very light and compact . 
the chair s back is designed to flex with your body . 
the glass lid lets you easily monitor how the eggs are cooking . 
i saw some models ,  not this one ,  came without the roller . 
this has proven to be a huge num_extend
nicely packaged also so the beaker wouldn t break during shipping . 
it has a comfortable grip that is easy to hold . 
i found a couple of oven mitts extremely helpful while steaming clothing . 
how sweet it is to finally have a decent knife . 
headset was not used for a week and was left off the charger . 
they fit well ,  look nice ,  and keep my knives safe . 
if you need a grill buy this one . 
has magnet to automatically start  alarm clock  mode when num_extend
for use in the fridge ,  i recommend it without reservation . 
i ve seen some people saying they thought it would keep things hotter . 
good price and seems to work just fine !  even has cord storage . 
i like to put fruit in these baskets . 
i have not had a bad loaf of bread yet . 
for best results with drinks ,  only fill with ice about %
i like my coffee stronger . and the price was excellent . 
for its low price it turned out to be very good . 
the oxo makes opening a bottle of wine or oil effortless . 
installed one of these on my bissell vacuum . 
just an outstanding product that no one will regret purchasing . 
i used it immediately and it works wonderfully . 
would definately recommend to anyone needing melted butter kept warm . 
can also be used to seal olive oil or any other num_extend
i love how easy these are on my hands to hold . 
it looks nice and shiny if you dry it off after cleaning . 
works just like what i bought it for . 
we charged the iphones ,  kindle ,  ipads easily and very quickly . 
these are perfect for using in the prep part of cooking . 
but it wasn t too hard after reading the manual . 
you don t have a choice to the heat settings . 
not to happy with the color selection to many pink and purples . 
chemex is just an all around fun coffee experience . 
one of the best kitchen items on the market !  . 
will order again when and if i ever need another one . 
amazing ,  simply amazing !  nice high rise and crust . 
i love the size and the extra grab handle on the pan . 
they were exactly what i wanted and what i needed . 
it is high quality and just the right size for a family of num_extend
stop wondering why your cakes burn or take too long to bake . 
with the kitchenaid silicone loaf pan ,  the loaf just popped right out . 
this was a gift and they loved it !  . 
mkae sure you wash it well after each use . 
an easy fix would be just a little foam around the microphone . 
your supposed to change your filter every num_num months . 
other than that it was a good experience . 
i use it about num_num times a day . 
than you already know how wonderful and flawless these products are . 
great to have for my music and safety and security . 
this is much better than the standard charger . 
you won t be sorry if you purchase them . 
charges good ,  just dont know about that bending flip thing . 
but no ,  it s just a really fine deal . 
these cables are perfect for my htc droid . 
and it has a nice heavy pocket clip . 
this is without a doubt the best peeler i ve ever used . 
the carafe is nice and heavy and it cleans up easily . 
they are one of the best pair of shears i ve used . 
got one for my wife and ones for my daughters . 
it is a genuine otterbox ,  so it is worth the money . 
the cases came to my house very fast . 
it will dry my full length wool dresses without damaging or stretching them . 
i used this with my ipod classic and the sound is pretty good . 
nice and big area for my cooking utensils . 
i ve outlived several different styles and brands of electric teakettles . 
the only cup that ever tastes good is the first one . 
the material it s made of seems pretty thick and durable . 
it is way off the mark and biased . 
this model grinds cofee beans acceptably and to the fineness that i desired . 
set the timer for the same time as you would the over . 
i got my case on time and i was happy with that . 
i look forward to buying more in the near future . 
the battery life is decent and charging it doesn t take that long . 
works well with my espresso and cappuccino maker . 
i charge it about once to twice a week . 
they show a lower reading while charging than when at rest . 
i reccomend any color variants of this blender highly !  . 
i just completed fully charging a generic bt battery . 
and the speaker is not as cute as i respect . 
this is a very handy little roaster ,  especially for empty nesters . 
freeze in them with the lid for future use . 
but honestly i like the flat thin pizza pans better . 
i bought one for my girlfriend who loves it too . 
removed lid ,  corrected amount ,  wiped lid and problem solved . 
then i turned it around the other way . 
you can t even tell there is a screen protector on the phone . 
open everything ,  separate ,  and count the parts before you start . 
make sure you buy the num_num inch ,  and not the num_num inch . 
that s with standby and plenty of talk time . 
this pan was really easy to clean and baked perfectly . 
and this time i read and followed the directions !  !  . 
because of this i give it num_num stars . 
some even lost them after one or two washings . 
the num_num cup feature is well worth the extra money . 
this product has served me well in the past . 
has a very sharp edge and most importantly the knife is affordable . 
but beware :  temperature tolerance is not as high as the packaging says . 
this releases the grounds that were caught in the filter . 
european knife lovers may be thrown off by the difference in design . 
for the wine drinkers and at a great price . 
the bowl sizes are handy and they wash up like new every time . 
but for one or two it s the perfect size . 
i bought this with the knowledge of the presto product . 
i can never go back to plain protectors after using this one . 
only dinged num_num star because cleaning can be a bit of a pain . 
that was a bit odd ,  but it works great . 
i bought this for my husband  he s the cook on our house  . 
don t be afraid because it costs a little bit more . 
i guess you could even take it on a backpacking trip . 
its been almost a year and my screen is still scratchless . 
the water boils so fast and is great . 
i sew in my basement and it is cool to cold . 
i did not use the plastic yogurt container . 
great for making candy and cookies and anything else . 
disappointed that it is made in china and not in the usa . 
the charge from the ac adapter and the pc just fine . 
very sharp and have cut through everything i have tried them on . 
i do like crisp bacon and this provides it . 
these are perfect and i had no issues with bubbles or anything . 
just wish there were even more pieces !  i recommend this set . 
i bought her a convection oven ,  which definitely helped . 
in any case this num_extend works perfectly with my lg voyager from verizon . 
this time the plastic shell broke ,  this time near the connector end . 
i am a popcorn nut ,  always striving to make the perfect popcorn . 
i think the dark blue goes great with the white iphone . 
i love all of the jewels on this case . 
it fits snug and it adds a small protection for dropping . 
i love the way this case looks on my phone . 
this sunbeam hot shot beverage machine is amazing . 
this now going to be a regular num_num month service for me . 
you are able to change case at any time . 
the iron heats up fast and has a very slick surface . 
sync ing it up with my iphone and num_extend was simple . 
worth the money if you have to slice bread . 
it holds more than i thought it would . 
i don t care for the butter infuser on top . 
this case is awsome i really like it . 
you would think that all can openers were alike but they are not . 
they are comfortable to use and easy to insert into the corn ends . 
the whole thing is low profile and slides in my pocket with ease . 
charges quickly for my android ice cream sandwich . 
just check the ka site to make sure this fits your model . 
i grill up veggies for pizza on this thing . 
the black shade was a little different and then i noticed  tones  . 
nice sized serving platter to go with the sorrento stoneware place settings . 
they re also fun for baking small amounts of cornbread and cakes . 
much better than paying $ at the local store . 
i know i save a lot of money on those nonstick sprays . 
one can actually broil a steak with a minimum of waiting . 
he said it is great for making pizza . 
the kickstand not so easy to open at first . 
num_num in the previous year review before the new cuisinart came out . 
bought this slot mount and it works perfectly . 
a wonderful addition to my kitchen and worth every single cent it cost . 
like i said in my previous review these spoons are great . 
i even caught my husband making a shake with this thing . 
i have gone through about num_num bluetooth headsets . 
this is a great little dryer rack for food products . 
what do you expect for the price ?  this is a wonderful pitcher . 
i have a tragically small kitchen and space is at a huge premium . 
product charges as advertised ,  though one must align the prongs before charging . 
ovenproof but no open flame seems to be it s only limitation . 
aside from this i love my pasta machine . 
my next one will have this feature though . 
i changed my rating from num_num star to num_extend
do not do the update that is available for the phone . 
keep it off until the dish comes out of the oven . 
no problems and you can t beat the price . 
the high sides help prevent the cooking from splattering all over the stovetop . 
i use bluetooth devices in my car or while out . 
the phone is not really thin as it should be . 
i got for camping and keep my big one at home . 
i cannot use my current car charger with this case on . 
its really cute nd exactly how i expected it to be . 
it was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result . 
i could not work without these great cutting boards . 
it isn t too difficult to remove and put on . 
now and new it was time to replace them . 
it s hard to rhapsodize about a laundry hamper . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
they are easy to use and really work well . 
just plug into your cig lighter and your aux in and your done . 
many varied uses and multiple sized donuts if you prefer . 
this comes with adapters to literally everything that i can think of . 
probably not good for people with young children; but otherwise they are great . 
i purchased this on amazon immediately and he was sure happy . 
the shipping was quick and the packaging more than ample . 
it does not look cheap front or back . 
i ve got additional discs and i can do anything . 
this feels to me like the ultimate pizza stone !  love it !  . 
no big deal ,  since it s not really necessary to use it . 
it s one use ,  but it definitely does the job well . 
anyway ,  you need one of these for mincing and chopping . 
i used it when i had my num_extend cell phone . 
it was a dull aluminum color with lots of fine scratches . 
they had this set for sale for $
i purchased this set to add to my existing rack . 
will recommend to anyone who has an iphone . 
i have been using these forever and love them . 
i use it for both my ipad and iphone . 
i think that it makes a superb cup of coffee . 
i have only used it once so far and it worked great . 
i purchased this rice cooker after reading reviews on cook s illustrated website . 
i have also used it to fry ground beef . 
this canner gives me confidence that i m doing things right . 
i have gotten over that for the most part  took a couple weeks  . 
the wide lip gives good grip for pouring ,  and it cleans easily . 
the screen faces inwards so it is protected from impact . 
i use it two or three times a day . 
well made and a great addition to cookware . 
the phone is nice but it does not come with a plug . 
some people say that the sides have excess and the corners come off . 
if you own any sort of smartphone you need a tpu case period . 
these earbuds look very nice ,  appear to be made of brushed aluminum . 
i am happy when things work out as expected . 
got this along with another set of pyrex bowls . 
handles get hot ,  use the locking tab to open . 
got this for my dad because his convenience store charger broke . 
when i want to blend my soup ,  the soup is usually hot . 
the pans are a good weight and clean up was easy . 
no problems so far with holding a charge as another buyer had reported . 
it also does us ,  uk ,  and metric conversions quickly and easily . 
do not have any problem getting the bread off the rack . 
i m purchasing another one for my other grandmother who lives alone . 
this works really well !  i use it all the time . 
has no difficulty pulverizing rock hard frozen fruit right out of the deep num_extend
people i talk to don t know i m wearing an earpiece . 
then boiled three separate water fills a few minutes each . 
everything there fits and all the buttons work . 
price is beyond reasonable for what you get . 
i like using it when i bake a ham or turkey . 
the case fits like a glove ,  and feels solid . 
this appears to be of a good quality stainless steel . 
it hasn t hardened from being put in the dish washer . 
i bought these to make english muffins for a mother s day brunch . 
they sell for $ each plus a small shipping fee . 
of course ,  beans ,  soups ,  and stews are also excellent . 
so ,  i went with randomby and got the pictured roadster . 
the handles on the cups are also nice . 
when using the guard ,  you cannot get cut . 
the disadvantage is that there s a bit more bulk . 
she was very happy with it as it easily pops onto the phone . 
cut my finger badly once ,  shame on me . 
lid works fine and the handle makes it so easy to pour . 
these yield  bigger  roasted beans of about num_num tablespoons . 
my oldventa num_extend ultrasonicdraws the same num_extend just plugged in  not running  . 
there were enough weights to cover the bottom evenly . 
been looking for this for quite a while . 
but i ve yet to find one that cancels outside wind well . 
as far as i know it has worked fine every since . 
very fast; virtually no clean up; extremely easy to use; works great . 
there is really no pop out features that are on this phone . 
i ve been using almost num_num months and still love it . 
we use it with a french press and it works great . 
a little hard to get on and off but no biggie . 
cleaning is pretty simple ,  but it can get messy . 
another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter !  . 
it will not protect from drops or spills . 
i was just anxious to try it out . 
the instruction says that microsopic bubbles will disappear eventually . 
a nice sturdy unit and only took a minute to put together . 
i don t want to put undue pressure on the wires . 
not with this one !  operation is very smooth and effortless . 
i love how simply it connects to phone . 
i did this while making the waffle batter . 
i usually keep it off unless i need to use it . 
it s unfortunate that panasonic is not selling this anymore . 
one recipe that i made was a pork tenderloin . 
i won t be paying a premium price for rosle products any longer . 
my razr num_extend after two years wouldn t hold a charge . 
i am now looking to purchase my own set . 
i just can t say enough good things about it . 
i feel its easier to handle and cook with . 
i am very pleased with the way this little vacuum handles and cleans . 
i found this one ,  same brand and almost the exact same look . 
we did learn not to store matches and candles in that drawer . 
this is a huge supply of butcher s twine . 
it works and the slices come out perfect . 
it reminds me so much of applying wallpaper . 
being microwave safe ,  we use them to heat up food as well . 
the steps are deep enough for the doll stands ,  too . 
use it to make soap ,  brownies ,  cakes etc . 
turn the oven on num_num  or higher ,  if you dare !   degrees . 
so i think that they re a great deal . 
it does take some time but i actually like the look of it . 
i use whole beans ground on the spot ,  tamped down . 
but as long as that doesn t happen ,  its a decent charger . 
i am just so thrilled with this jar . 
so i decided to go phone hunting and settled on the num_extend
going straight to digital should cut out the noise ,  right ? yep . 
overall i am pretty happy with the timer . 
finally thought to check amazon and sure enough found these . 
cooks anything justa s well as any microwave and is easy to clean . 
also protects camera lens that sticks out from inspire . 
forget the white cheap ones they are horrible . 
this battery is the same battery for a one sixes the price . 
okay ,  this chopping block really is a block . 
as a side note ,  there is a forward facing camera . 
i gave it to the wife for her ipad . 
beautiful pot that i leave on the range . 
i bought this for personal use for my morning coffee . 
not a problem for this one ,  its just another cork . 
this case is super cute and i cant wait to carry it . 
however ,  when used as directed ,  it delivers the goods flawlessly . 
nothing fancy ,  does what it is suppose to do . 
if you try it on the other one it will pop right off . 
both shiny ,  and matte handles only  they look classic ,  yet modern . 
a gel case cover solves the cheap feel . 
they are the same size and pretty much the same product . 
must have for bread making for poolish ,  biga and lavien dough starters . 
the item was packaged well and arrived ahead of schedule . 
the best thing about this peeler is the very comfortable handle . 
you can always take all the old seasoning off and redo it . 
i planned a elmo themed birthday party and these were a hit . 
i have used them in the dishwasher several times without incident . 
they work wonderfully for baking cookies and muffins . 
i have only had these for a short while but i love them . 
but this food mill has been a pleasant surprise . 
of britta water from the fridge and put it in the pot . 
i have several sets of tongs and these by far out perform them . 
i always use a screensaver though because it is necessary . 
it comes with three sizes to snuggle in your ear to your liking . 
volume buttons are a little harder to press but it s fine . 
i can make up french fries quickly as well very clean looking frys . 
this cover made sure that my back cover was completely sealed . 
would not put a droid in service without it !  . 
i bought mine several years ago at zabars in nyc . 
the price is cheaper ,  but the quality is top of the line . 
i still like my elago iphone cases better . 
otherwise we like this set and would buy again . 
this is a common mistake on this machine . 
use a paper clip and press it down . 
it keeps coffee hot for almost num_num hours . 
this is hands down the best pizza crisping pan i have ever used . 
the fit and quality of this case are impressive . 
i like the double layer  armor  and the sleek black look . 
i have one at home and this one is for the office . 
the french bread recipe in the recipe booklet is terrific . 
please note ,  the num_extend was released around january of num_extend
the ability to handle multiple email accounts ,  including exchange . 
i have owned a butter bell for several years . 
was a drop in upgrade and she couldn t be happier . 
let s get real here ,  this juicer isn t perfect . 
the vertical sides also help contain the food . 
the only thing that is somewhat frustrating is the slowwww filtering process . 
other than that it works very well and helps make excellent pasta . 
it is sturdy and fits well in my hand . 
fits snug but a little big to fit in the pocket . 
these do fit my ka pro num_num mixer rather snug and nicely . 
much heavier than the anolon  classic  crepe pan and cheaper as well . 
the included instructions are silent on what they are ,  what they do . 
i don t bother with radio stations or cd s anymore . 
the panels are really pretty and much nicer than boring plane ones . 
ordered it and received it in two days  no shipping charges  . 
we use this item with our fondue set . 
the battery fit well and it lasts very well . 
i noticed a reviewer mentioning  false advertising  on these vacuum bags . 
so i bought more and told himto leave mine alone . 
bought these along with the amco measuring spoons as a gift . 
i love this case ,  although it s just a bumper . 
not for iphone or phones with top buttons . 
okay ,  none of that is actually going to happen . 
used these to make fondant leaves for cupcakes for an autumn num_extend birthday . 
i love the size and they do not stain . 
no more having to buy separate car chargers !  . 
they are very well priced and extremely sturdy . 
i have a motorola droid num_num with the superior holster and case combination . 
we have tried many different models from the least expensive to quite expensive . 
i bought it based on other people s reviews . 
glad to have a generous supply on hand . 
but i don t see how anybody is losing their phones . 
use your fingernail to press the volume buttons . 
my daughter has a passion for baking and decorating elaborate cakes . 
no more aggravation in making breakfast pancakes or omlettes . 
does take a little longer but the coffee is great . 
this is my first bluetooth product and i couldn t be happier . 
love it ,  and will miss it when it  goes  . 
don t let what appears to be it s small size fool you . 
i purchased this dish pan to wash hand washable items in . 
honestly though ,  the iphone num_num case should be factory recalled . 
bluetooth connects easily and survives many sleep cycles on my laptop . 
i was also thinking they should be short . 
the lids can stain with sauce ,  but are okay . 
i bought num_num sets over num_num years ago . 
setting this functionality up was simple and switching between phones was easy . 
i would recommend this product to my friends . 
i only wish that the speaker base was bigger . 
and they really make my kitchen look much more sleek and clean . 
it s good to know i can still find a replacement !  . 
i left it for a few minutes and the picture showed . 
great for frying when you cannot use a splatter screen . 
this worked very well ,  better than expected it . 
no software; just one java game come with the unit . 
i do not have any issues described by others . 
no heat transfers through the mitt to my hand . 
this case looks absolutely beautiful on the phone . 
works okay on tablet but bulky for phone . 
i recommend anchors because it allowed me to hang more weight on them . 
these work great !  my daughter takes her lunch every day . 
for purpose of cooling they server there intended use . 
for those reasons ,  this hot air popper gets my vote for no . 
the bamboo handle is thick and well attached to the basket . 
it also has an soft color light that glows red while charging . 
add in the assist handle and this is an incredible pan . 
the bristles are soft as well as flexible . 
the sides provide nice grip ,  and i love the matte back . 
you get a good phone at a good price . 
i am certain it would do very well protecting it from a fall . 
cos she can easily see the numbers on the keyboard . 
my le creuset spatula is useless with this recipe . 
just a heads up in case you use juice defender . 
it only amplifies what signal you already have .   i noticed immediate improvement . 
so now i have both sets of bowls . 
washed it and put it to work immediately to make bread . 
i bought my kitchen grips from  that shopping channel  a long time ago . 
i scrubbed them out ,  but they left tiny poc marks . 
also ,  butter isn t the best for keeping food from sticking . 
this stone has served it s purpose thus far . 
the phone fell straight down on to the screen with a muffled thud . 
this is a better phone regardless  check out cnet s comparison  . 
i tried to cut shapes out of grilled cheese . 
the front edges are slightly raised to protect screen though . 
i ve had my presto popper for about num_num years now . 
with caution ,  there should be no issues though . 
heavy weight ,  thick glass ,  clear measurements ,  easy to clean . 
i love everything about these cup except for one thing . 
cup of espresso just so no one is confused . 
+inexpensive and effective grateri use it primarily for zesting lemons . 
pretty annoying ,  to the point where i have removed the cover . 
it s worth the extra time at the gym !  . 
the butter stays fresh and soft !  as an unexpected benefit . 
i have had one of these for several years . 
i baked my first cake using these rounds yesterday . 
amazon has a very good price for this . 
i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own . 
it is a bit of a lint collector . 
i usually try something before i give it as a gift . 
this knife compares favorably to my much more expensive japanese knives . 
since i no longer have this phone i don t use these protectors . 
the num_extend has met and exceeded my expectations . 
bought these to pressurize my whip cream maker ,  which they do easily . 
it says to peel all citrus and pineapples and i did . 
turn them on and turn on your device and your good to go . 
it stated size in volume rather than measurement . 
i ve tried several others ,  none of which worked . 
this grill brought back long forgotten emotions to my life . 
the lid is much lower profile and seems to be made better . 
just give it a good rinse and air dry . 
the design is simple and easy to use . 
this has to be the best thermometer for meat . 
it removes the lint which causes less bubbles . 
i needed large capacity ,  this one is num_num cups . 
it provides descent protection and moves easily in and out of pockets . 
i finally had a cup of hot enough coffee and great tasting coffee . 
not much i can say except that it fits perfectly in my dehydrator . 
it s great for those with experience who found the included wand disappointing . 
i bought this to use with my cooldaddy deep fryer . 
i always find many uses for my command clips !  . 
so far it is really nice quality can opener . 
i get a lot of compliments on it . 
i have num_num of these and they work very well . 
would recommend to see this in a touch screen with a qwerty keypad . 
your savings alone from bulk will more than make up the cost . 
the trigger seems like a good safety feature to me . 
i was surprised at how well and quickly this thing makes froth . 
i keep several around the kitchen ,  camper ,  garden shed . 
the itorch is the upgrade from a powergen num_extend
i beat the hell out of it doing what i do . 
of course you could just ignore all this ,  as most do . 
no problems and pops a huge bucket in like num_num minutes . 
perfect for holidays or anytime you want a quick treat . 
they come two belts to the pack so you will have a spare . 
this car kit was highly recommended to me by many people . 
it does the job with little effort required and is fairly ergonomical . 
i but these by the case so she won t run out . 
i purchased this a few years ago when it came with chopsticks . 
i am pleased with the purchase and intend to buy more . 
my case was easily fixed and the overall case is great . 
they are not very translucent ,  if that matters . 
but this plug helped change all of that . 
this is my first pressure cooker and i use it all the time . 
this small adjustment results in a perfect round waffle . 
before this case i was using the incipio ngp case . 
it was so much easier to use than the traditional rolling cutters . 
a sturdier ,  better designed rack would be hard to find . 
coffee that i bought was konking out in only num_extend
feels more faster ,  i think there have been performance num_extend
there are a lot of things to love about this pan . 
with only one adjustment to the control and it was producing perfect waffles . 
easily switches to the left or right side of your num_extend
if it had a big  mute  button i would be totally satisfied . 
we use this with our cast iron pan . 
but it does fit snug ,  and offers reasonable protection . 
hard water could require more maintenance than i find needed . 
i got my cover faster than i thought . 
great because it is small ,  lightweight and simple . 
the one i received didn t fit me well . 
i received my second new processor ,  and tried to make cookies . 
also ,  don t use the handle to tighten the  pot  down . 
i think the length of it is okay . 
this jar was recommended as superior for making sauerkraut . 
they are flat ,  which is somehow difficult for other manufacturers to replicate . 
a staple in my household for years now . 
it came with a nice pizza peel and a pizza cutter . 
the plate with the holes hinges outward for easy cleaning . 
so for me its a num_num stars item . 
however the case is very nice and sophisticated . 
i love it !  it s just what my son and i needed . 
it will result in a home made beer you can be proud off . 
and remember to follow instructions for your bluetooth device . 
be careful when cleaningbut its still an awesome pan . 
the muffins slid right out with no problems ,  and nothing stuck . 
main carafe ,  stem and lid all are made of stainless steel . 
it had been acting up for a month . 
i have used this to cook rice with excellent results . 
plan on two of these to hold a gallon of milk . 
i was very impressed with the customer service . 
helps keep my ipad screen cleaner then using my greasy fingers . 
and they are a conversation piece !  every cork slides out effortlessly . 
maintaining a moderate heat ,  cook for num_num mins until the mixture num_extend
prices go on up to $ and more ,  i guess . 
the waffle iron came with recipes on its package . 
the only downside is that they can t fully seal a jar . 
as for loss of image quality ,  i see none . 
i found that easier and simpler recipes can be found online . 
the camera cut out is beveled so there is no shadow . 
easy to clean !  just keep the sharp knives away . 
it is strong and solid and totally lived up to my expectations . 
i replace once a year as opposed to the recommended num_num months . 
i use these everytime i cut grass and they work great . 
i really love this it streamlines my baking process nicely . 
the only downside was that it scratched very easily . 
but that s all of them i ve tried and just my opinion . 
i thought it a bit ridiculous to review coffee filters . 
no issues with the protector what so ever . 
very strong material and lightweight !  fine in microwave . 
the fat will start to coat the finish . 
this works better than i thought it would . 
i found the price to be lower than some other products . 
loaves .   some have commented that the slicer guide is too wide . 
as for cleaning not as awful as you d think . 
if i needed this again ,  i would definitely buy it from amazon . 
waffles are done very easy with no efforts at all . 
the bag stays pliable and easy to use right from the cold . 
makes nice cut outs of marine life for parties or just for kicks . 
these shears cut and clean up like a charm . 
the thick rubber sleeve protects the phone well inside the harder outer case . 
this is great for both home use and camping . 
we call the  muffles  and any flavor of muffin mix works . 
it is able to charge my phone in under an hour . 
i really like the fact that it has num_num plug in places . 
this waffle cooker is a great value for the money . 
i am a j a henkles german made fan . 
add me to the long list of folks who love this pitcher . 
it doesn t work well with big pans num_num inches and bigger . 
for one ,  nothing sticks and i cook at least twice daily . 
i bought one of these at least num_extend years ago . 
i need to get another one and a larger one . 
she said they re much nicer than the ones she has . 
next you experiment until you get the desired doneness . 
it works exactly as described and it cleans up easily . 
they work well and seem to be made of high quality metal . 
it s okay though ,  i have a skinnier one she can use . 
depending on how much junk is in the air . 
the whip makes whipping egg whites or whip cream a breeze . 
i had a brand new one within a week or two . 
this is a great product and came exactly as described !  . 
my other bluetooth had began to make my ear sore . 
so did i ,  that s why i bought this powerful beast . 
i would prefer a larger timer with a bigger display . 
i also like that they have a case and are compact . 
this was a while ago  ,  but it is good . 
the coffee grinds perfect for my gold filter; just fine enough . 
cannot continue to reco these earphones strongly enough . 
bought to hold my thunderbolt in a pickup . 
moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now . 
the oval shape makes it easier to get it into a jar . 
they are thick and sturdy and come off of the clip ring easily . 
put in the popcorn seeds and plug it in . 
whereas i simply slide my knives back and forth on this diamond stone . 
the usb  power out  connector is very tight . 
i use mines in the house and car . 
cooks burgers ,  pork chops ,  and chicken breast to perfection !  . 
i will buy again ,  when i need filters for the coffee maker . 
so far i am happy as a clam ,  it works beautifully . 
this one is smooth and cleans out well without leaving any smell residues . 
the downside to that is that its a dust magnet . 
the guidance for baking makes it sound like ir is faster . 
it bring me with much fun with my iphone . 
nobody carried them ,  which is why i ordered them online . 
it was batteries i was most interested in . 
i revised the product rating to five stars . 
the worst part is the packaging and a few connection problems . 
i topped them off with blueberries and nonfat ,  plain yogurt . 
owned an earlier model of this same product . 
i don t think the thermostats on economical heaters are that accurate anyway . 
the case is good protection for my phone . 
i bought several of these and use them every day . 
i have never had this problem with this one . 
havent had any problems with this car charger very pleased . 
it s so small you wouldn t notice it s there . 
normally stopping for the convenience store coffee a few times a day . 
had to turn the phone off and then back on yesterday . 
this is the best funnel i have owned . 
i have used it several times already and like it . 
genuis idea to whoever came up with it . 
i had to purchase another brand to get the larger size i needed . 
it s not that hard to figure out if the lid is on . 
we now use a coffee press and a tea pot with loose tea . 
great little pot and dipper ,  cute design ,  slotted for spoon . 
i noticed no rusting after the racks were washed and dried . 
it makes it very hard to see the screen . 
i left this stone behind during a recent move . 
use scissors and get an extra two inches . other than that . 
this one works nicely ,  efficently and cleans up so easily . 
clearly one of the best items i ve ever purchased on amazon . 
seems big but they cooked up just fine . 
they re a very tasty cookie with anise extract in them . 
if you are looking at this buy it now . 
this case does feel more sturdy than my previous one . 
the exterior and interior enamel coating is very durable and easy to clean . 
i recommend it to all level of cooks . 
very time consuming since i use num_num to num_num shots . 
my elderly mother can t manage the heavy bottles . 
whenever i visited my phone got zero bars . 
but besides the size of the grater itself is the handle . 
i carry it around for hours and it s still on %
this is one product we have gotten our money s worth out of . 
i m pretty rough with everything ,  and this looks and feels good . 
i bought this to hang in my closet for sweaters . 
battery is easily accessible and cheap to replace . 
i thought i loved my ipod ,  but this phone is way better . 
this little rack fits a the same size baking pan like a glove . 
the commuter series is nice and slim compared to the defender series . 
this is the second waste can like this i have purchased . 
good call quality ,  fairly intuitive to use ,  and works well . 
and in few hours it went from red to purple to blue . 
this case is what the description says it is . 
they are the perfect sizes and the quality you would expect from pyrex . 
these are top quality protection for your investment . 
i purchased this coffee grinder for the purpose of grinding whole flax seeds . 
french press is sturdy ,  well protected double walled stainless steel pot . 
then stir and wait num_num minutes while it brews . 
so far ,  i m very pleased with this device . 
so very much for making my juicing experience so easy . 
sprinkle pan with cornmeal  not too thick  stirring to brown it . 
another negative is that it doesn t have a light . 
i have found this easy to use and it makes great popcorn . 
i think ,  that is an excellent product ,  i recommend to all . 
i don t know what i did without a wireless headset . 
i also like the feel of this case . 
fondant peels right off ,  royal icing cake decorations too . 
like this cover very much ,  especially because of the color . 
the num_num fits well as a result of its design . 
it is so easy to use ,  easy clean up and easy storage . 
excellent for cooking foods that are desired to be tender . 
and you can put hot food in and and not break it . 
the filter actually filters and doesn t leak grounds into the num_extend
mist is nice and even and it seems to be built pretty well . 
once on the phone ,  it is definitely not coming off by accident . 
heat it all up on medium while your kids crank the handle . 
i can t believe i m writing an iron review . 
the size is fine for me as i generally just cook for myself . 
i really like the pattern; grows on you . 
it still came out a bit too high and puffed up . 
it is very heat resistant and works well withmy stainless pans . 
lots of extras . i can t say enough good things about it . 
it was super heavy and i got it shipped for free . 
i am assuming this one will not last long . 
i choose to go with the num_extend because it had more juice . 
and they are the exact size of the bigger spice shaker holes . 
i am wholeheartedly thrilled that i made it and cannot recommend highly enough . 
the blade grinder can t really be compared to the other num_extend
it stores so much inside and even on top . 
it brews fast but still produces good num_extend
it s more accurate to measure by weight than measuring cups . 
if you can find a good deal ,  it s definately worth purchasing . 
it has charged my iphone twice of a single charge . 
we have not put it in the dishwasher or dropped it . 
let it warm up first ,  or it will stick like num_extend
i love the way it feels to hold the phone . 
i ve lost track of how many of these i ve bought . 
i personally like its compactness and easy storability . 
finally an egg poacher even i can use . 
this pan is a great size for many uses . 
i settled for th purchase of a different phone . 
it was cheaper than driving to the next town . 
i used a secondary strainer because i wanted absolutely no pulp . 
so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced . 
it encases my phone to give a feeling of being well protected . 
very fun to watch and also pretty easy to clean and use . 
it is stable and the bottles are secure . 
i have been using them for num_num years . 
it s easy to clean and easy to use . 
easy to clean too ,  just rinse it off after every use . 
this is very easy to hold veggie brush . 
for the $ this is an excellent grill and easy . 
the case fits tight and stays locked on . 
for now a fine addition to any modern kitchen . 
it needs something done about the gripping surface . 
has crystal clear sound which will sooth your ears and soul . 
the design makes corelle very easy to wash and dry . 
no matter what grind i used ,  it overflowed . 
however ,  don t put the lid in the dishwasher as i did . 
the first thing i cooked was bacon and eggs . 
these are dishwasher safe and work great . i highly recommend it . 
this set is perfect ,  what i wanted for a long time . 
the screen that i installed for her works very well . 
it has a strong clip that swivels num_num degrees to provide great flexibility . 
as a sole user of the popper ,  it is a great size . 
the charger came in its original retail box ,  unopened . 
i love this pink color and the sound quality is great . 
we used it a couple nights after we received it . 
this way it doesn t slip out when it s clipped on . 
num_num sets were bought over num_num months ago . 
he has one in each vehicle he drives . 
but it makes cutting a lot easier and enjoyable !  . 
i m quite conservative in how i turn it when popping . 
the old vacuum had been missing the dust . 
it s truly a fine design and it s extremely well made . 
this is perfect ,  or did i already say that ?  . 
i also keep them inside wide drawers because i have the space . 
we both have black iphones and the contrast is great . 
at last ,  a headset that i can work out with . 
these knives are my most useful accessories in the kitchen . 
made in the usa and good enough to replace the incipio . 
we have used it to prepare bottles of formula for babies . 
i will never go back to anything else . 
fits regular battery with a case on the phone also . 
its harder to remove than the original ,  but thats a good thing . 
the plastic screws that hold the inserts are holding up fine . 
it looks very nice in my living room . 
i just leave it out on the counter and can reach it quickly . 
yes these knives will rust if not properly cared for i . e . 
the long handle means people hold the strainer far from the glass . 
it gets daily use and has never failed us . 
the basket stays in great shape and can be washed in the dishwasher . 
no bubbles ,  and it allows me to see everything as normal . 
but i wouldn t be able to afford it . 
does a terrific job frying fish ,  fries or doughnuts . 
i make it the night before and let it sit overnight . 
my mom just got her iphone and she loves it . 
i have had prepaid phones for a few years now . 
the clarity is really good and the sound is great as well . 
i m very proud to have my kitchen aid mixer on display . 
i used an infrared thermometer first to check it . 
this when filled does not stick out like the leathercraft . 
the jars are aesthetically pleasing ,  and seal up nicely . 
but that just means they can use that amount . 
mine did come with the security bungee strap . 
it does what i bought it to do and the price was right . 
this product works as advertised and cannot be beat for the price . 
so far round num_num is working well  :   . 
sealing too many things too fast will result in less secure seals . 
this is the real deal with a compression clamp . 
it fit my phone and it works perfectly now . 
keep it seasoned and it will last a lifetime . 
grind your beans last .  .  . when the water is ready . 
i m totally pleased with these and would recommend them to anyone . 
as the old saying goes ,  happy wife happy life . 
i might buy another one just in case they stop making them . 
i give this num_num stars for a reason . 
plus the usb extension is always nice to have . 
i use this to get through an otterbox on my iphone . 
but cant seem to let the other one go . 
i needed a second cast iron skillet and this one fit the bill . 
the temperture control is mounted on the side  ,  this is a plus . 
one of the best purchases i made in a long time . 
i ll be ordering another to share with my sister . 
display is easy to read and it is a quality product . 
mines a sprint so ick !  everything is easy accessible . 
nice and big ,  make sure to have a very large surface stovetop . 
the bamboo handle can also be used a crude gauge to oil temperature . 
glad to have it back in the wood block . 
so ,  i went to amazon . com and searched for knife sharpeners . 
i leave gps on most of the time . 
the stylus pen is made well and definitely serves its purpose . 
i highly recommend ,  and will be buying more . 
i immediately add some salt and it seems to stick well . 
i have used this case for a while now . 
it worked perfectly for chopping herbs and spices . 
it doesn t jiggle and doesn t go all over the place . 
yep ,  it s a hundred bucks plus ,  no argument . 
under twenty bucks and free shipping incredible deal . 
made fiesta bread and it came out perfect . 
i was pleased that it fit fairly comfortably and securely . 
works great on lenovo num_extend nexus num_extend skyrocket num_extend
the case protected the phone and did not crack the case . 
other than that ,  it kept everything dry the whole time . 
i went through num_num sets of plastic ones this past year . 
for a family of num_extend this is ideal . 
the nib also allows for detailed work including drawing small circles . 
works great ,  many features ,  along with a great brand . 
all the chefs on tv use this brand . 
has a nice soft feel and fits snugly onto the xperia play . 
i have used them frequently during the holidays with no problems . 
cant beat the price !  hold a charge over time pretty well too . 
they wipe clean easily ,  and are pretty behind my white china . 
i ve used these chopsticks a few times and am satisfied . 
they are quite sturdy while feeling lighter than i expected . 
salt shaker can even accommodate some varieties of sea salt . 
the width is perfect for serving casserole ,  lasagna ,  cake and burgers . 
it is a little picky about what kind of milk it froths . 
it was cheap and it does it s job . 
utensil is large ,  handle is thick and sturdy ,  wood is smooth . 
i use it and the num_num qt for everything . 
not much to say about a measuring cup . 
popcorn cooks fast ,  but the butter doesn t keep up . 
it was a really good buy in my opinion . 
it is the   zyliss quick blend whisk   . 
the type you need is determined by the degree of protection you seek . 
its great don t get me wrong i m just lazy . 
both sides of the blade are tapered perfectly without any nicks or gouges . 
just slides right into the oven . that s been my experience . 
they are not the cheapest ,  but you pay for what you get . 
you can use it with fruit on the counter . 
i have excellent knives that are kept razor sharp . 
i m probably just a freak of sweating nature . 
amazon tried to fight it and lost the battle . 
handy as all things you need are included in one box . 
i love how easily it syncs with my iphone . 
neither of them would be considered heavy duty but they do their job .

these rings are much smoother the plastic hooks .

we even used it to filter the water at the place we stayed . 
i bought it to keep my strawberry preserves . great product !  . 
i have had several different brands and these are just the best . 
i got this one because i wanted the biggest one i could find . 
in fact i just ordered some sweet yogurt culture on the net . 
these are simply basic pieces of storage ware . 
i wished where the apple logo was that it had a circular opening . 
one has a purple charge light ,  and a blue full charge light . 
overall ,  the waffles come out fine ,  but do stick on occasion . 
this tamper gets the job done for a very good price . 
they can last for years but eventually need to be replaced . 
this phone gets the job done very well and is impressively fast . 
i use it to chop all kinds of spices and nuts . 
thankfully ,  many lids fit more than one pot . 
this thing works great for keeping cutlery  and fingers  safe . 
it protects the camera lens that sticks out the back from scratches . 
enough pressure ,  solenoid valve ,  well made ,  stainless look . 
it reminds me of my wall air conditioner when it s running . 
the spoons or forks have not bent at all . 
 a demitasse ,  the size of an espresso cup  . 
i heard about oxo by researching another product and realized their quality ratings . 
i fixed that by buying two of these . 
the jabra easygo bluetooth headset is no exception . 
both times my bundt cake came out immediately upon turning the pan over . 
it is also cheaper to order thus way . 
got this with phone case purchase for son s christmas gift . 
and lets face it ,  there is a type . 
usb itg works outs of the box with no issues . 
they worked well and give good protection to sometimes careless hands . 
the sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response . 
i would recommend this grill to people who miss grilling outside . 
the case is attractive and also lets you see most of the num_extend
theyare easy to keep track of in my purse . 
it really takes up no extra room than a standard charger . 
my kitchen is quickly becoming a  kitchenaid kitchen .   . 
i have the num_extend and now this num_num inch . 
i keep it by the juicer to try new juices . 
audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss . 
l need larger sizes than this set offers . 
great for bacon and awesome for pan searing steaks . 
this is the best case that i have every use . 
the marks on this pot   or at least mine   are totally off . 
i can use my keyboard and mouse with my tablets with ease now . 
very sturdy and nice and small for a countertop . 
i like the feel on the touch screen better than without the protector . 
it made it so easy !  i am addicted to this handy machine . 
the handle is comfortable to hold and it is absolutely fantastic . 
likewise ,  while charging the icarrier ,  no significant heat is generated . 
pour my mix in ,  and put it on the mixer . 
the pot was in a lovely box so the sticker is quite redundant . 
all in all ,  however ,  a very good purchase . 
very nice storage for muffins ,  rolls ,  other baked goods . 
purchased this to replace an ancient krups slicer . 
i make popcorn all the time now with this amazing hot air popper . 
it sounds like a generic product but works like a professional tool . 
it worked perfectly for our needs ,  and it looks great . 
everything is visible ,  easy to find and access . 
i can t think of anything to say bad about them . 
it fits good and i found matching wallpaper screens to go with it . 
but i mainly want the num_num rockwell hardness  i dont do bones  . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
it is a bit too small to make an omelette in . 
loved the first one and love this one . 
this went went on without the watermark issue . 
this is such a useful little usb port . 
convection is very good and cooks much faster and is quiet . 
this teakettle is just so handy and quick to heat . 
i look forward to doing more business with you guys . 
i m giving it four stars instead of five because of the expense . 
i go out and am dropping my phone constantly . 
it comes with num_num charging cables :  mini ,  micro ,  and ipod . 
the spaetzle is much more evenly dropped into the pot now . 
but overall wonderful cloth for various needs in the kitchen . 
i love this charger for my sony num_extend
i have num_num of these cases ,  black grey and red . 
i think the battery should last longer than that . 
it has to be picked up with a tea towel to avoid burn . 
it scratches easily but its better than permanent scratches on your screen . 
this bluetooth is great !  the battery life is very good . 
great addiction to the rest of the stuff . 
when you lock your iphone you get a handy little mirror . 
it was a replacement for her last lg num_extend which she loved . 
the only problem i had was the flash hole . 
however ,  when i tapped the mic ,  nothing happened . 
i have a couple of these in my kitchen . 
i was impressed by the quality of this wood . 
i just ordered a second one ,  and am considering ordering several more . 
my wife really likes the weight ,  easy use and cleaning capacity . 
the set also looks good on our black granite kitchen counter top . 
my cat runs away when he hears it perking . 
i never had connection issues with an iphone . 
i bought this as a gift for my daughter . 
i had the smaller one and it broke while i was moving . 
these will jazz up your cupcakes especially if these are for children . 
the only issue is the finish is terribly scratched up . 
got the red and they add so much to the kitchen . 
you can also field phone calls while listening to music . 
i get many compliments about the pieces from friends . 
tops restaurants tend to use convection rather than regular ovens . 
never leaks ,  even upside down in the bag . 
well ,  it s a melon baller .  . not much to say . 
the person calling could hardly hear me and there was a noticeable echo . 
it was easy to push and made the carpets look like new . 
the gaggia is still a good machine though . 
the sone s porosity means it will stain easily . 
others didn t stay on ,  fell out ,  and were easily lost . 
best made ,  perfect fit ,  best price in the last two years . 
it was definitely screaming at me to put it one . 
nice pot ,  great shipping ,  will use for years . 
i ve tried pizza stones but find them to be too much trouble . 
finally the thermostat may be useful for some but not me . 
the aluminum one lasted num_num years before it s lid parts broke . 
i needed a sauce pot for the house . 
it really had me confused for a few minutes . 
some of the oem packaged units omit this earpiece . 
due to the type of case it protects my phone well . 
i definitely recommend these to anyone looking for cookware for their toaster oven . 
and ,  i no longer have problems with clogs . 
not a big deal once you get used to num_extend
the color looks very nice on a white iphone . 
this would make it easier to attach to various places . 
i first bought this for use with my nexus num_num tablet . 
it works really fast and has made my life a lot easier . 
it s absolutely worth it for the improved flavor of the coffee . 
farberware stainless steel pans are simply the easiest to cook with and clean . 
not only do the earbuds sound better ,  but they also feel better . 
i give this num_num stars with no dislikes . 
this is the exact battery that came with my galaxy sii by sprint . 
generally you get about a year from them before the plastic breaks . 
it has a plastic cover that covers the flash and lense . 
i have had it for num_num months and have no complaints . 
helped my son get rid of cough from stuffy nose . 
@tanium ii vacuum travel mug  at the same time . 
this is a simple but good pressure cooker . 
this vacuum cleaner was definitely worth the price . 
it is nonstick but i think it works better if lightly oiled . 
i bought the factory refurbished model and it came looking like new . 
i usually make about a half a dozen rolls at a time . 
i don t know if it s the other party or the headset . 
great when you re battery is low and you need a boost . 
most sets like this have a round mini ramekin that will dribble butter . 
other than that this case is very recommended . 
this is another high quality item from microplane . 
a bonus is that a num_extend mechanical pencil came in the package too . 
protects from drops in the house ,  car ,  outside ,  and workplace . 
no ,  you don t put fine chef s knives in the dishwasher . 
i blame apple for not making standard components . 
also to preserve the pan ,  i recommend hand washing only . 
if i ever have to exercise that option i ll update the review . 
this pan really should not be sold without one . 
i purchased this krups waffle maker and have been very happy with it . 
namely trying to use a blood spot remover . 
they are flexible enough ,  and are easily hand washable . 
i think everyone is always looking for a good quality cable like this . 
i love having an easy alternative to plastic containers and these are perfect . 
from the picture i thought i was getting to batteries . 
i even tried my boudin screen on it ,  and it fits !  . 
lightweight with plenty of power for smaller jobs . 
this bumper fit my iphone num_num like a glove . 
needed these bags for our food saver system . 
and that is usually enough to make the knife cut better . 
besides i haven t seen a grill by them so far . 
if i have a most valuable pan ,  it s this one . 
way better than old oem battery which came with my phone . 
 sorry ,  just needed to get to the word limit on reviews  . 
it makes a gurgling sound if the reservoir isn t cleaned . 
true ,  this charger will charge multiple devices ,  num_extend
the price is great for a burr grinder . 
i especially like to use this for making guacamole . 
a great set at a great amazon price . 
you can take the ring off though lol . 
i have had mine for two months already and i love it . 
it works great ,  and is very easy to clean . 
the first thing we did was crush ice . 
i bought it for my friend and he likes it . 
for my needs and experience ,  i can recommend this headset highly . 
the sun had dried and baked the adhesive . 
i m ordering severa different colors for my daughter to mix and match . 
i can throw them in frozen and they come out well every time . 
the one thing that drives me crazy about this mixer is the splattering . 
it really is like having an extra pair of hands in the kitchen . 
this is ,  quite simply ,  the best bluetooth headset i ve had . 
i use this main when doing yard work . 
much better than my old method in a muffin type tins . 
the unit itself is pretty sturdy and seems to be made well . 
it does what you d expect for a wooden cooking spoon . 
this pan works great and i use it for many things{sometimes even frying} . 
i have not encountered this yet ,  but haven t tested extensively . 
when i first got these i checked for calibration . 
the holster is easy to use and swivels . 
easy to install ,  and works very well as they said . 
cant seam to be a minute away from his phone . 
they are very nice looking and high quality . 
butter is kept clean ,  no bugs or flys can get to it . 
i am impressed with thequality and weight of the piece . 
the cost is cheap ,  so i felt it was worth it . 
it works well and the cover attaches securely . 
nice ! only wish it were a num_num cup model . 
it can hold num_num pounds of pasta or num_num pounds of mashed potatos . 
this is our second west bend egg cooker . 
this mount will work with the num_extend and a slim case . 
i bought this to replace my num_num year old otterbox defender . 
i love the new set i have for my toaster oven . 
the whole thing is kind of like art for the kitchen . 
i needed something to put refuse in while sitting out on the deck . 
what surprised me most is the capacity of this press . 
great product ,  highly recommend and would buy again . 
this recharger fits snugly in a small box or even a small bag . 
still haven t chipped a single glass and they get used often . 
i use it almost every time i take a bath . 
it was and is one of my favorite knife for its  shape etc . 
i m amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape . 
it works great and charges the device just like plugging into the wall . 
your ties definitely will not slip off this unit . 
it also prevents screen from cracking for small slips . 
it took me a long time to decide on a coffee grinder . 
unfortunately ,  the battery on the num_extend doesn t last long . 
which would save you a lot of money over the long num_extend
the screen protector fits perfectly ,  and had no issues installing it . 
now i just pick up the rug before letting the roomba clean . 
get ready to save all your garden abundance for the winter . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
it gets up % of the stuff on my carpets and rugs . 
why waste your money ?  just get this one !  . 
you can fit a ton of food in it . 
i ve made num_num batches with my machine; here are my observations . 
with the otterbox it s just too big ,  too sturdy . 
all the accessories that come with the mixer fit under the cover too . 
this was also handy to take camping to make coffee . 
i use it mostly to stir big batches of homemade chex mix . 
it s easy to use and seems very accurate . 
the battery life on this unit is great . 
how much wine is left in the bottle is also important . 
stay away from cheap pans and buy nordicware when you can . 
amend your review that are unfair to the company . 
i ve had these for num_num phones and several years . 
very few kernels unpopped and popcorn tastes great . 
i got a couple spare batteries on the cheap from amazon . 
i m going to buy a second one to keep in my car . 
best of all ,  it is made in the usa !  . 
for the price ,  this is an excellent product . 
i use them to broil and bake and they wash well . 
it has a little light to let me know it has power . 
other than that ,  it cleans up quick and does a great job . 
i had warmed up some meatloaf with the sauce on it . 
i never thought that i would buy a bluetooth . 
i did not want a glass press because of concerns about breakage . 
well worth the money and the wait to find them . 
i would not buy a pixi or pre plus if i were you . 
oh ,  and let s not forget how great it looks . 
i love it ,  so bought one more of them . 
they both love the versatility of this pan . 
we have had the rice cooker for about a year now . 
i just love it and use it all the time . 
i found it the following afternoon ,  in the parking lot at work . 
also very portable i tale it with me all the time . 
so use your stylus and poke the little hole at the bottom . 
i found the sound very clear ,  and now i use it everyday . 
we milk our own goats and wanted something secure and good size . 
this dehydrator has surpassed all of my expectations . 
i did try it and it was very good . 
this spatula has a blade that thins out to a very flexible edge . 
you just skim out the good stuff from underneath . 
after a few months of use my first unit stopped charging . 
i bought this car charger for myself because i got an iphone . 
there are some things that you need to num_extend
i finally wore it out a couple of months ago . 
we made a white loaf of bread on the quick cycle . 
i think this is the best case i ve had so far . 
that was a huge disappointment and should never have happened . 
which is why i decided to buy the pro+ model . 
this is my go to pan for everything . 
this is something i have always wanted to try . 
for some reason though i keep breaking this size . 
bought as a gift for son and he loves it . 
small price to pay for fine stands ,  though . 
the farberware lids fit the anolon pans perfectly and are very useful . 
it holds a charge for as long as the original . 
when they are not laying flat they bend . 
sometimes the dishwasher doesn t completely clean he larger tumblers . 
cakes and cookes have all come out quite nicely . 
you will be just throwing that money away . 
it s a shame these phones never took off . 
i like that the outside doesn t collect fingerprints . 
a stronger person without shoulder problems would have no problem . 
you can use for hot or cold drink . 
it also ,  less than half the price of the belkin case . 
i am a fan of cast iron so this product did not dissappoint . 
i ordered fiesta java mugs which hold much more liquid . 
i have no intention of doing anything that extreme . 
the batteries worked well in the phones without a problem . 
this press is perfect for num_num mug of coffee . 
yes ,  i highly recommend this purchase to anyone . 
i think you will be very happy with your choice . 
it is a clean ,  simple design which produces perfect results . 
i had a set of those small yellow corn ear holders . 
for the price ,  you can t go wrong with this one . 
but not as all day comfortable as the jabra wave . 
do make sure you wash thoroughly in between uses . 
finally a good non stick pan . hopefully it will last . 
 we needed a separate juicer for the wheatgrass . 
these will work in a pinch but they are super thin . 
love the flavor of fresh ground pepper frrom the pepper mill . 
the keys are pretty small for my stubby fingers . 
the battery life seems to be really great . 
the samsung siii has a plastic cover that is somewhat slippery to hold . 
the product stuck to the wall until i was ready to move out . 
very nice for organizing papers and other small items . 
this oxo product like most of their designs is great . 
i definitely notice a difference in shelf life when using the vacuvin . 
i wish it had a more rubberized texture . 
but i want the benefits of garlic too . 
note :  for best results ,  preheat the pan at low heat . 
i like this item better than other burger presses that i have used . 
this cable works just fine as it should since its an htc original . 
the handle recedes to make it less tall to put away . 
i use them mainly for scooping out flour ,  sugar ,  etc . 
you ll be a lot happier with your dehydrator s capacity !  . 
i see no reason to pay the big bucks . 
it is by far the best garlic press i have ever used . 
it use to chop anything from garlic to herbs to nuts . 
it might be slightly overpriced ,  but i would repurchase this item . 
i am rediscovering the iphone i love in a dead zone . 
if the bottom of your lodge pan says num_extend this will fit perfectly . 
very minimalist and sure to get you compliments and questions . 
this item shipped very quickly and was easy to apply . 
the dirt devil num_extend is a powerful little hand vac . 
the belt in the vacuum didn t last but about num_num weeks . 
overs superior protection against drops ,  falls and most vibrations . 
be careful with the product and you ll love it . 
i still have this charger and still works . 
this is a super peeler !  very happy with this purchase !  . 
maybe i have sensitive ears ,  but that s my take . 
so often we have a recipe calling for the juice of one lemon . 
wish it had some sort of padding underneath to protect counters . 
no mercy for the weak ,  i slammed the hammer down once again . 
it s so easy to make healthy lunches and dinners with this press . 
this is yet another high quality item from nordic ware . 
after my ipod found the headset ,  it appeared in the menu as num_extend
a great value charger for usb powered devices . 
they go perfectly in my house; i love the design of the dishes . 
we love them ,  for zesting and peeling citrus fruits . 
when i  flipped  the cakes onto plates ,  they slid out very easily . 
each culture packet can be used to make about num_num lbs of cheese . 
this seems to be a nice protector for my daughters phone . 
this high caliber set of cookware will last for years . 
these are precision cut ,  easy to apply and an great value . 
for rapid brewing ,  simply flip the tumbler upside down . 
much better than the slightly cheaper plantronics explorer num_extend
i don t even remember buying these it s been so long . 
let me tell you ,  this pan is worth the money . 
they all love it and it has become highly coveted . 
it is well made ,  but i think hand washing is recommended . 
these are my go to sticks when cake poppin . 
gave this a try and found that it works . 
i guess that applies to all the ceramic blades . 
it basically needs to sit in the freezer overnight before each num_extend
definitely recommend this to anyone looking to replace their can opener . 
it removed all the winter s dirt and mud . 
it is definitely a must have if you bake a lot . 
i just wish they weren t attached as a pair . 
i thinking of getting the kitchen aide unit next . 
it seems sturdy and well made ,  we ll see over time . 
num_extend which is why i bought the upgrade . works great . 
really ,  almost anything you can pipe into the horn will work well . 
we use it primarily when we are indoors to cook up chicken breasts . 
this is because verizon wants you to use their vcast online music store . 
given the limited degree of additional mobility of a bluetooth headset vs . 
i would highly suggest not leaving the water in it after use . 
nothing in my kitchen is handled with care . 
love to make small meals works great for oatmeal . 
i got this as a gift for a guy . 
that might just be a personal issue i have with not paying attention . 
now ,  do they sell the lids separately ?  no  : p . 
use very little water ,  very clean ,  not too hot to handle . 
they both work equally well and are durable . 
microplane graters were originally intended for professional use . 
works well and now i get two full days of phone use capability . 
it s a great way to increase your vegetable consumption . 
for the most part it works very well . 
this works perfectly when only a little shredded cheese is needed . 
this works perfectly and is well made from quality materials . 
it has a solid weight and hasn t chipped easily for us . 
overall a great cover to buy for the evo num_extend
my husband put it together in an hour or less . 
the lag time can be from num_num to num_num seconds . 
it fits together nicely and looks very smooth . 
it is actually a nice looking kitchen gadget . 
amazon does have better prices than the local stores . 
a very nice set which arrived in beautiful condition . 
the sound quality was also pretty good on both ends . 
fortunately ,  it was not broken as others had experienced . 
you can actually watch the cat puke  or worse  get sucked up . 
the color is lighter ,  the pattern is the same . 
one little tip before you head to the grocery store . 
when those little word correction boxes pop up  . 
the pan is heavier duty than my other pans ,  also . 
its great for anything from eggs to veggies . 
it has a cross access slit for cables or headphone cable . 
slowly add the remaining water in batches until you have the volume num_extend
probably a good idea that they are almost impossible to separate . 
it can also froth milk for your coffee . 
however ,  the coating on the outside wears pretty quickly . 
others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear . 
she was even more pleased that it was a lodge . 
this has been a very good carpet cleaner . 
not much to write about an old otterbox . 
i confirmed this by charging my ipad and my android phone without any num_extend
much easier and cleaner than without a lid . 
callers on the other end can hear me clearly and vice versa . 
this is fairly long and will cover up two side by side outlets . 
i tore mine apart and put an num_extend ii inside it . 
so ,  i decided to get some stereo bluetooth headsets . 
just what i needed to do my canning this year . 
it will hold a large if you have a keurig coffee maker . 
the tiles came with a few small yet rough scuffs on the edges . 
would def buy again for my new phone . 
the remote can be placed anywhere as it is wireless . 
the quality is excellent . i do reccomend this clips ! excellent option . 
the best thing about the dispenser is its convenience and easy of use . 
i bought this and the num_num cup bialetti . 
the global actually changes the way you cut . 
we are very pleased with the henckels mincing set . 
by the way ,  the circular pizza tray can be bought separately . 
i don t care much for screen protectors ,  to be honest . 
it ll turn it into powder in two seconds . 
we have one of these in every car . 
most of them fit in spice jars  tablespoon is too big  . 
it also is much easier to clean than many of our other devices . 
but it s still easier for me to use measuring cups . 
the measurement markings are engraved on the handle and include us and metric . 
that sounds like a lot of water but it really isn t . 
it s worth the addition on my pan collection . 
it is an alternative to a spoon dish . 
i have dropped a few times and yet my phone still likes new . 
there is no instructions about strips or labels on them inside the packing . 
some whisks have thin handles that can be uncomfortable . 
holds and locks nicely for storage and turning . 
have always had a fat separator for the holidays . 
great glass container for making my homemade almond milk !  !  !  . 
it was a great phone ,  do not get me wrong . 
i would recommend this charger for the samsung galaxy num_extend
he has used this model for over ten years . 
the ipad is definitely not falling out of this cover . 
they would not work if you do need a tight seal . 
i purchased the plantronic num_extend based on a friend s recommendation . 
the vornado is better constructed and works better in every respect . 
improved touch sensitivity over the otterbox protector as the obx a thicker plastic . 
these are great because you dont want to scratch your screen . 
i also got this steel to sharpen my other knives . 
these were a gift to my daughter especially for her christmas biscuits . 
great if you make a lot of soups ,  like i do . 
this a piece of kitchen machinery that is gorgeous and sturdy and indispensable . 
the waffles came out crispy and huge !  the kids love them . 
the blue light is a bit annoying but i will survive . 
for the cost its a great value if it lasts . 
it fits perfectly and it doesn t make my phone look bulky . 
i bought this thermometer a couple years ago and use it very often . 
this little girl comes up to me and says . 
keeps the coffee warm longer without additional heat . 
i wanted these for scarves ,  actually ,  and they have worked perfectly . 
i usually take my time putting in the raisins . 
however ,  such a design does have its uses . 
it fully charged my phone and still had juice leftover . 
it made the correct quantity and beautiful crema . 
once i caught on ,  i was very pleased with it . 
they are great for when you need something smaller . 
i wanted to see how i like it before i ordered another one . 
now i use my canning jars for more than just canning . 
with steak and meats the grill works great with rubs and spices . 
it makes nice cookies  ,  the non stick has held up well . 
it lists some pretty good ideas that look fairly easy . 
a little pricey for cheap tableware ,  but worth it . 
item was well packaged ,  arrived promptly and in perfect condition . 
very strong and seems like being resistant to time s test ,  hopefully . 
i purchased it as a valentine s day gift . 
she loves these and they are easy for her to use . 
i had bought this model to gift it for someone special . 
got this to replace an old plantronics explorer num_extend
it just feels well made when you use it . 
the mixer works just fine even in the smallest bowl . 
this is probably the most comfortable bluetooth headset i ve ever worn . 
i ordered these and couldn t be happier with them . 
for the price there are no complaints from me . 
it s also a nice size for a side salad . 
i seem to surrounded by a number of transmitting towers . 
it has lasted several years through almost daily smoothie making . 
for that purpose ,  this thing is worth its weight in gold . 
this case looks like the seido case ,  but it is cheaper . 
i haven t used the grill side of the plates yet . 
eco sent priority mail right back to me . 
no problems or hassles connecting and syncing using windows xp or vista . 
this is the second jabra bluetooth speakerphone being used in our household . 
after reading previous posts here i tried again this morning . 
this stand is extremely good ,  especially for the price . 
the iphone charging cord was a tight fit as well . 
this is an incredible bargain for a great piece of calphalon cookware . 
reminds me of my mom canning in the kitchen when i was little .

i have to change filters often but most people would not have to . 
they should have just made one big cutout . 
the samsungs were much better in all these areas . 
the touch screen on the intercept had issues ,  compared to this phone . 
the holder in adjustable to fit most products . 
i use it mostly for cutting vegetables for salad . 
arrived in a week or so using the regular shipping . 
i bought this as a solution to limited cabinet space in our kitchen . 
it even has a built in screen protector that is smooth and flawless . 
i figure it is the fibrous nature of the parchment . 
i also have to pass along a good word about kitchenaid . 
the lifter wouldbe ok for pancakes or the like . 
it takes a licking and keeps on ticking . 
my husband says it was the best gift ever . 
i love this thing !  it does it all . 
next ,  add the turkey and mix it all together . 
this case has a tackle touch which makes it nice to carry . 
it is great just like the other one i had . 
my only complaint is that the power cord is not long enough . 
i also purchased one from another amazon prime site for much less money . 
just wanted to see what others had to say about it . 
the chemex coffee system has been around for a long time . 
it took less that num_num hours to fully charge my iphone num_extend to %
i love oxo products ,  and this item is no exception . 
this motorola dual charger gets the job done . 
i m very happy i didn t have to assemble it . 
looking forward to making another batch of cookies with this scoop . 
great product overall an gets the job done . 
next ,  i m happy with the quality of the product . 
i have always used otter box ,  defender ,  reflex and commuter . 
however ,  i have found that to be true with most cuisinart products . 
this is a solid choice for an iphone num_extend case with battery pack . 
it is much easier to fill the tank with a bottle . 
small cup has already cracked after num_num months of use . 
i am probably accustomed to poor toaster performance throughout the years . 
one scoop per cupcake or waffle ,  two scoops per mini loaf . 
it is easy to use and simple to coring an apple . 
it is easy to use and the product is great . 
gps is a big drain on your phone . 
this product is average or above average for the price . 
it works better than any other grinder i ve owned . 
highly recommend cast iron for those of you that have never tried it . 
i like these and the fact that there is back and front screen . 
this is a nice size for a small meal for two . 
let me caveat this review by saying i love rutland products . 
i was happy to see they are still being made . 
if you dont have a bluetooth system ,  you re still in luck . 
i thought it was more of a maroon than red . 
makes coffee in about num_num minutes each morning and ready to go . 
great product to hang stuff without putting holes in the wall . 
i love all of my calphalon  mostly hard annondized  . 
the heater and turbo unit are still fine and work great . 
the timbre and pitch of the voice is just not relaxing . 
previously ,  i had a tempered glass cutting board . 
i purchased this for my mom who has issues with her hands . 
i have always wanted one of these and received it as a gift . 
no problems with conductivity through the screen protector either . 
the color mixes in easily and well and it s richly colored . 
the instructions say cook the egg for num_num min . 
i own the samsung galaxy s num_extend num_extend bought this with some trepidation . 
for the price i paid these can not be beat . 
i got this iron after researching lots of products and reading countless reviews . 
the first one lasted for many years before it finally got dull . 
it also fits other phones just as well . 
other reviewers have mentioned the magnet falling off . 
as always with amazon ,  fast and easy delivery ,  . 
came earlier than expected in an envelope ,  none were damaged . 
still ,  it fits snug and isn t coming off easily . 
french fries are a breeze with this disk . 
i am wearing them now while i write these reviews . 
i was very pleased with the performance of this griddle . 
great phone ,  came in brand new ,  packing was great . 
it s flush with the front unlike some of the other cases . 
they always seem to be a year behind the phones of the present . 
prevents ground coffee from entering your coffee mug . 
we re empty nesters ,  and i use it several times a week . 
i pretty much scrubbed up ,  which is somewhat overkill . 
it does everything we expect ,  and does it well . 
in fact i gave my son my old tongs . 
they are a little gritty from the cast . 
was great being able to drink real coffee in the morning while camping . 
i like it ,  and the price is unbeatable !  . 
works perfectly in venezuela with companies and current working conditions . 
the discription is true and the customer service is excellent . 
surf and work all day and night on a single num_extend
this is an excellent purchase to upgrade from the kitchenaid . 
i love kitchenaid mixers ,  and none have every failed me . 
the dishwasher is a staple in my everyday life . 
i haven t found anything to stick to it yet . 
it has been working fine for several weeks . 
she loves that they are individually designed for fruit , veggies and meat . 
i love the num_num sizes and use them every day . 
battery fit with no problem and my son reports keeping a charge well . 
there just is nothing better to bake cookies and pastries on . 
i like new trent products better than other chargers i have tried . 
so it depends on what s important to you i guess . 
such a small device for how much juice it can hold . 
add to num_num cups boiling water on stove . 
i use them when i bake cheese cakes . 
it brews a cup of coffee very quickly . 
this is an awesome product for my samsung galaxy num_extend
i found all of those options in this case . 
this can opener is durable and cuts through cans like butter . 
had an older version from about num_num yrs ago finally kicked the bucket . 
they now seem heavy and clumsy in my hand . 
also easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher . 
it is compact and works great with our batteries . 
i purchased this to use with my ipad when traveling . 
i especially like the droid s full exchange support . 
bake at num_num for about num_num minutes or until light brown on top . 
the blade is very sharp and has lasted a long time . 
num_num sheath type hunting knives i own and use on butching large game . 
also ,  the sound quality from this is much better . 
this did the trick he is always thanking me for it . 
i am a huge pizza eater ladies and gentlemen . 
i pretty much agree with ilikeamazon s review below . 
i wouldn t think we d need an oven thermometer . 
i wish the ridges were a little closer together . 
i had the non  pro  version of this and am glad i upgraded . 
picked this up at the px in pr for around $
by the way ,  i just ordered two for gifts . 
thank you for your prompt service as well as standing by your product . 
this is a nice pitcher with a good seal . 
i filed the edge on mine with my leatherman to smooth it out . 
this comes with num_num usb cables and an assortment of connectors . 
very nice screencover !  took forever to arrive but its worth the money . 
i had an issue that i didn t think mattered that much . 
i rushed to amazon to find a replacement . 
i have purchased many of these to salvage sofa cushions . 
the brand name of this one is oker brand by wireless accessories . 
great little pan for melting butter or cooking eggs . 
this machine is just awesome !  simply go for it . 
you can always add more time until you get it right . 
i like the glass rather than the plastic . 
fits in my pocket and is very durable . 
if you are not careful ,  you can rip the plug underneath . 
the other adapters would be useful in charging a plethora of devices . 
i did a lot of research before deciding to buy this one . 
mine also had a pizza paddle which i still use today . 
looked all over the city for something like this . 
it will not fall off of your belt . 
not sure i d like it if it were heavier .   . 
i would highly recommend this product to purchase !  !  !  . 
oil it immediately with a very thin layer of flaxseed oil . 
the next day the coffee is still warm enough to drink . 
in this particular style of oxo ,  i own just about every utensil . 
the machine is great and great looking and worked as advertised . 
it can handle huge gallon cans and tiny dog food cans . 
this would definitely come in handy in the kitchen . 
this is a beautiful cutting board at a great price . 
it has the removable crock and hand operated setting knob . 
i ll try to remember to edit after i finally test them . 
i bought this knife after reading the reviews . 
they have been used consistently ,  have also been dish washed . 
the firmly attached blade is totally heat resistant to num_num degrees f . 
the brita pitcher did this too so it is the design or material . 
i did use water just off the boil; i think that certainly helped . 
i liked it enough to order a second one  :   . 
downside :  not ideal for making small serving sizes . 
at least one a week ,  and sometimes more . rye bread . 
it s is a must have for lifting multi layer cakes . 
i think these are great kitchen shears for the price . 
ever heard of a canary in a coal mine ?  yeah . 
it s a good phone ,  but i like the iphone better . 
stews and chilis of course ,  aren t really affected . 
i would definitely purchase again if and when the need arise . 
for one person servings this rice cooker does the job . 
the difference with this protector seems to be the texture . 
the grated cheese will stay inside the grater until you are finished . 
used for my satellite speakers with no issues . 
i love the little fleur de les in the mold . 
it is a wired headset in the form of a telephone handset . 
i will buy more next year if not sooner . 
the price was excellent  . she is completely satisfied . 
you might find yourself looking for other places to use this thing . 
i wish there was an easier way to switch from grams to ounces . 
i have put this in the dishwasher and have not had any problems . 
that is ,  if you re looking for a great pasta dryer . 
it comes in handy on the plane and is easy to carry . 
can go all day and then some with no loss of radio signal . 
a nylon dishcloth or soft sponge works wonders . 
the flower pattern wraps around the whole whole case . 
it also keeps the cell from slipping out of you kids back pocket . 
nordic ware however is made in the usa . 
i got so many compliments on this case ,  it was so unique . 
 for some reason i feel morally obligated to make the ends point down . 
it maintains high heat for a long time once up to temperature . 
it is sharp and the handle is comfortable . 
i wanted to get two more for other rooms in the house . 
it s only gotten more and more nonstick with age . 
the popper workd perfectly from the firs time i used it . 
i am glad it s not loose . great case for the price . 
i purchased one of these many years ago locally in town . 
but many other headsets require you to push buttons  or hold them down  . 
i have a problem with hitting them against something hard . 
i don t see how this board will ever warp . 
individual cornsticks shaped like ears of corn are always a traditional favorite . 
the hot pot i have now ,  is my third in num_num years . 
it turns out that my only recourse was a pitcher based unit . 
using the num_num oz meant i had one less thing to worry about . 
i can t believe the quality that has gone into this mixer . 
i still think it s the best sounding bluetooth headphone to date . 
there are less expensive which do the job . 
i have had one of these for about forty years . 
i purchased this  based on cook s illustrated comparison of similar products  . 
num_num or something on amazon as of now . 
the battery is charging fine and lasting quite a while . 
i ve only had to charge it once and battery life seems excellent . 
my fiance loves this case ,  and loves the protection it gives . 
this can opener is a workhorse ,  easy to use and to clean . 
just be gentle when transporting to the dishwasher . 
i even cooked a small turkey in it a few years ago . 
this repeater is simply two different length antennae . 
it gives them a very solid ,  and quality feel . 
i really like the sim card cutter it works very well . 
the shipping was fast product was just as described or better . 
it has the biggest capacity pitcher i have ever seen for the price . 
without a holster it s not that easy to slip into a pocket . 
everything works and the esn was clear to activate . 
clean and easy way to make popcorn without all the fuss and mess . 
the quality of this pan is solid and will last for years . 
it was too old for even a new battery . 
i got the agility this week and tried it out last night . 
i was skeptical ,  but i guess they know standard cabinet sizes . 
this is why i went with a thicker one . 
very well made for a lifetime of use . 
so to me that is a very good deal . 
great sound ,  and almost perfect to workout with . 
little muffins can be taken out without burning your fingers . 
the blade has a wonderful combination of flexibility and rigidity . 
even the hot water trick did not help . 
my wife requested a pressure cooker so i got her this one . 
light weight ,  buttons are easy to locate without having to see them . 
the knife is sharp and the steel keeps the edge in good shape . 
i have used them in the microwave with no problem . 
great battery life ,  perfect sound and it fits fine . 
it uses hspa+ ,  which i can t complain about . 
we are happy with the purchase of our deep cleaner . 
my stock battery been sleeping in my bag . 
it has a built in sceen protecter that doesnt scrach easy . 
i am happy i purchased it because the price was right . 
i love using this set when we have crab legs or lobster . 
i like the compact size and heft of the phone . 
it has a thin edge perfect for egg flippery . 
color and quality of manufacture just as anticipated . 
but overall a great product that i enjoyed very much . 
i like the fact it is dishwasher safe . 
i bought another from another vendor and spent a few dollars more . 
first complete charge lasted num_num hours or so with moderate to heavy use . 
i have had the num_extend for almost num_num years now . 
i went home and looked at the macy s $
the more that you do that ,  the greater the pressure . 
he gave it to a family member now it s all better . 
these are the same brand ,  metrokane ,  as the houdini stoppers . 
makes for an effortless pull with one small negative . 
i ve made a pot of coffee this morning . 
stands up well to very ,  very heavy use on a daily basis . 
i also appreciate the screen cleaning cloths that this item comes with . 
on this design ,  the easy to reach switch is the on switch . 
it fits over two burners on my gas stove top . 
i rarely use high heat with cast iron . 
this little pan worked like a champ and they loved them . 
he said he never liked coffee from a electric coffee pot . 
other than that ,  it is a good pan . 
i love the size of this baking sheet for cooking for two . 
this cleans up well ,  looks very nice and distribute head evenly . 
feels like it is protecting that expensive device protected well . 
we assigned each family member a color ,  and purchased num_num sets . 
rubber surrounds the device ,  and plastic part fits over that . 
i never found them ,  so i called old dutch . 
i recommend this for anyone in need of a good corer for apples . 
it s not cheap ,  but you get what you pay for . 
i haven t noticed any one sided toasting issues . 
worked with the different eartips and got a decent seal . 
the gadget person i am ,  i set out to purchase my own . 
i have no idea of the brand name ,  make or model . 
it also looks cool on the kitchen counter !  . 
phone call quality is excellent for both parties . 
but a little pricey if you ask me . 
i bought this for my sister and she loved it . 
this is by far the best i have ever used . 
it fits tight and it is not easy to take it off . 
i love that it is permanently connected to power when in the dock . 
i use this as an omlette pan and it works perfectly . 
this device keeps them charged and ready to go !  thanks !  . 
this car mount is really good for the price . 
what i love about this set is how solid it feels . 
works greate with my battery case ,  as well with a normal case . 
with this case i didn t have any problems . 
emtying the bin is easy and doesn t make a big mess . 
but the price tag is really steep for a single pen . 
great for travel ,  poolside or in the office . 
after thoroughly washing hands ,  rub fingers into every nook and cranny . 
worth buying to have as an emergency backup . 
very well made ,  and the glowing motorola logo is a cool touch . 
this strainer is study and made of fine stainless steel mesh . 
i also have a metal mortar and pestle and a marble one . 
it does what it is supposed to do . 
i actually use it more for grinding spices than coffee . 
i would recommend this anyone who is cooking in a dutch oven outside . 
it holds not only the disks but the stems as well and blades . 
i bought this because last year i melted a plastic one . 
i d highly recommend the purchase of this oven . 
there is nothing like fresh ground beans if you drink coffee . 
it also stays in my hand without sliding . 
this pan works great as long as you season it properly . 
got this based on cook s illustrated review and was not disappointed . 
i have been bowled over by this product and it s convenience . 
the metal is thicker than cookie cutters for sure . 
the earpiece is designed to go into the right ear . 
the red color is perfect for my kitchen too . 
i ended up buying a second one because my husband kept stealing mine . 
i can see now that i will be useing this pan alot . 
but for now ,  i heartily recommend this coffee maker !  !  . 
it wasn t all the time but it happened more frequently than lifeproof . 
this was the first bluetooth that i have tried out . 
not sure if it s just num_num or num_num weak ones or not . 
both are easy to put oh the num_extend
if you don t get a refund ,  leave negative feedback . 
my blackberry only began to crash after i received a bad sim card . 
nice to see that dustbuster technology continues to advance . 
it is a very nice added touch to my country kitchen . 
this creates a very thin clean look that is not bulky at all . 
it s a clear screen even with the matte finish . 
my phone looks better in this case than it does with out one . 
these are great to protect you iphone screen from scratches . 
one thing to consider is the weight of a full pitcher . 
doesn t leave any residue or smell or ickiness . 
this is a great device at a great price . 
i don t have any issues to report on this one . 
i received my stone triple packed ,  so no breakage . 
no burned corn at all like you get from the microwave . 
the case protects the phone and keeps it from slipping from my hand . 
works great i have all the attachments and use them all the time . 
i think they used a whole tree in making this thing . 
i highly recommend this for wedding gifts too . 
the price point for these is very low too . 
also ,  the holster secures the phone very well . 
i m a tea drinker and this is a must have . 
we use this popper about once a week or so . 
i wish i would have waited for her old one to die . 
they either burn up from the heat or their locking mechanisms fail . 
then years later and more people in the house . 
it shipped fast and arrived in great condition . 
can t go wrong with pyrex; they really cook sorry about the pun  . 
nothing has ever burned on me using an electric or gas stove . 
thought i d do a review to let other folks know . 
the poplite is the fastest ,  easiest way to make the best popcorn . 
this little machine did the trick !  makes fine snow . 
it s nothing beautiful but works like a charm . 
i used these to ice my christmas cookies this year . 
he said it is just like the movie cars . 
importantly ,  i have not noticed any degradation in responsiveness . 
lid is a perfect fit for my lodge num_extend cast iron skillet . 
now i just use this pitcher and it is so much more convenient . 
it s easy to clean and the angle makes it easy to slice . 
it took me a while to get used to num_extend
we have owned and used a set of these knives for several years . 
never had it come out or even hint at coming unlodged . 
my son s cell phone battery was dying out quickly . 
i was getting pretty bored with my phn so i ordered this case . 
stove top percolators are so much better than electric ones . 
this is a great set !  perfect for anyone . 
not because of problems ,  but because of the multiple needs . 
the num_num month warranty is longer than most competitors . 
i can be anywhere in it and still have reception . 
so be realistic ,  it will smoke during food cooking . 
basically we wanted the impossible trifecta of good ,  fast ,  and cheap . 
separate fan speed adjustments allow for every combination . 
this qualifies as a  small  mixing bowl ,  and it is a beauty . 
this one is by far the better quality . 
i think i ll super glue that to the cap . 
the oven continues to work like a champ . i m pleased . 
i also like the colors available for the otterbox . 
follow the instructions to get full capacity during charging . 
i purchased num_num of them and they have worked out perfectly . 
the variety of serving bowls come in so handy . 
too big for everyday use outside of my home imho . 
i opened them up and immediately tried to put one on . 
the packaging could have been better ,  but it worked for this time . 
i would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup . 
excellent product for regular and widemouth canning jars . 
i do not see how to hang a wheelbarrow with it . 
but it does stay in place while inside the phone . 
then i asked the chef at the cafe at work . 
i would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan . 
i was worried bout ordering glass containers online for the quality of shipment . 
it works very well and you can t beat the price . 
i found the recipe in thescandinavian home cookingcookbook . recommend . 
so i would suggest to improve the battery power on this version . 
many inexpensive ,  and most expensive headsets have awful output . 
i do not like this style of bluetooth headset . 
i make several batches of almond toffee every christmas . 
i like this one better than my last balistic case . 
my wife is num_extend and we have tried a lot of bt sets . 
you should core your fruits before putting them in the juicer . 
this is probably one of the nicer cases i have owned . 
the bissell cleanview ii is not that expensive and does a good job . 
background  hiss  is almost undetectable at normal listening levels . 
the problem was that it tore up the meat . 
this is protein and cooked protein is hard to remove . 
now i only wonder why i waited so long to buy it . 
like this device ,  its small compact and works well . 
i researched it carefully ,  reading all the reviews ,  etc . 
this is so much easier than slicing and then peeling the apples . 
now i use this as a dedicated voip phone . 
thankfully ,  this whisk performs just as well as it looks . 
they pop into the dishwasher and washup without any problem . 
the gaskets ,  understandably ,  had become dry and brittle . 
i love ice cream but i shouldn t eat sugar . 
probably the best fitting back case or shell around . 
using steel utensils with stainless steel cookware is not problematic for me . 
not totally air proof ,  which not a bad thing . 
it poaches the eggs well and releases with just a little cooking spray . 
i think it s quite a good value for what you get . 
i wouldn t hesitate to do it all over again . 
the four capacitive buttons on the bottom work more often than not . 
so ,  that could be a switch for some people . 
it simply looks like a second skin ,  matte black . 
it runs itself and docks itself when the battery pack is num_extend
the quality is ok for all these sticks ,  as expected . 
been wanting a new processor for a long time . 
these bags are just what i needed for my new electorlux vacuum cleaner . 
my iphone battery is practically never been used since i got the mophie . 
would make a great gift for just about any kitchen . 
i have adapted some of my recipes for main dishes to the oven . 
i use these nearly every time i cook . 
when i purchased this item ,  and received it . 
just unplugging the machine puts you into another confusing area . 
normally i ll use it wet to finish sharpening a knife . 
we could not be happier to have bought this pitcher !  . 
guess i ll get my new one from there . 
my wife and i both use it with no problems . 
it is excellent at collecting dust and small debris . 
i purchased this for my cell phone and it does what it says . 
next i made a big batch of chili . 
you can t bet the product or the price . 
nice big popcorn popper does a good job if the kernels are fresh . 
one thing is certain :  it does perk great coffee . 
now cooking with fresh garlic is a no longer a chore . 
bought this for my wife and she really likes it . 
the good news is that my wife s is still going strong . 
the lids snaps on securely and this pot never drips a drops . 
one with the rimmed soup bowls and a standard cup and saucer . 
if it had been ,  i probably would have gotten a second one . 
don t be fooled into thinking that it s flimsy . 
it really does make a wonderfully rich ,  smooth cup of coffee . 
otherwise ,  it looks good and is a darn surdy case . 
krusell makes the best cell phone cases in the world . 
other reviews said the baskets tilted forward when extended . 
my husband and i both have smartphones that are bluetooth compatible . 
if i could change anything it would be to offer a num_extend version . 
trying to get the door off ,  though ,  is a nightmare . 
i do like it but this is better and holds more bacon . 
the fittings really don t fit we ll with my ears . 
no fear of loosing anything and easily slid out . 
all in all ,  i am very happy with this carafe . 
i also like to grill chicken breast on the grill . 
this is the old fashioned granite ware like grandma had . 
sometimes ,  chicken also creates a sticky substance from its juices . 
i am definitely going to buy this product again . 
i got compliments on it all the time . 
i measured ,  and it holds one num_extend cup of sugar . 
this does the same thing but with added protection . 
other than that problem this product is great . 
i was very impressed with the quality of this pan . 
and love the idea that it comes in num_extend
i was very pleased with its very fast boiling . 
hard to find these large size hot pads . 
or ,  wait and go for one of the next generation num_extend phones . 
got this for my mom and she loves it . 
my husband likes soft poached ,  i like firmer poached . 
i even found two quart mason jars to seal bulk items . 
the skinomi looks flawless as i followed the install instructions to the letter . 
nothing feels thin or dings with a high pitch to show cheap material . 
i have found this even more useful than i expected . 
all the holes are in their correct places . 
these are the perfect size for soup and cereal . 
i purchased two of these to store homemade ice cream . 
it is light weight but has good suction for a broom vac . 
all microwaves are different when it comes to power levels . 
my gf basted the crap out of ham with this thing . 
the biggest difference is the location of the back button . 
i like its feel in my hand and on my ear . 
much more elbow grease is required when cleaning this . 
the glass is frosted in the middle with clear tops . 
i can boil tiny potatoes and steam broccoli at the same time . 
i will order here again and i recommend buying this product . 
theses are great ,  and so useful for organizing my scarfs . 
what i like in a bluetooth is just simply that it works . 
the blade is extremely sharp and cuts easily . 
does exactly what my husband needed it to do . 
price is great for such a good knife . 
look at the picture and it should tell the story . 
but it is very sturdy and works very well . 
my husband was delighted and we ate it all week . 
if not the bottom crust ,  then the top ,  it never fails . 
i have found that the cellet products work well for the apple iphones . 
this unit so far holds a charge for weeks and weeks . 
this cheesecloth is very economical ,  and of good quality . 
we are so happy that we invested in these knives . 
all salad spinners have some variant of this problem ,  though . 
and in the summer this heater keeps towels from getting musty so quickly . 
overall this is a great gadget that is much more than a novelty . 
i just know that what is inside that jar is fresh . 
now how many vendors can you say that about ?  i know . 
so i ordered her two pairs from amazon . 
consistent grind every time so far and its quiet too . 
i purchased this pan from amazon and i love it . 
i have found that the microlane grater is easier and more versitile . 
makes me feel professional to have it though . 
i can t imagine i got the quality product with only $
i leave it on the counter and use it a lot . 
it charges with my phone s charger and it streams audio . 
very sturdy and heavy ,  not flimsy at all . 
for average ,  everyday kitchen uses ,  this should be sufficient . 
some may actually prefer the looks of the num_extend
yes ,  it does just that and quite well . 
it holds up very nicely and still looks like new a year later . 
just the right size and seems to be of high quality . 
i ve used it on a gas grill with great success . 
when i filled it ,  hardly any flour would sift . 
it really does suck most of the moisture out of the carpet . 
this is the machine that we all use in italy . 
love this cover ,  it is simple ,  clean and easy to wash . 
if you lean against the desk it moves . 
the phone slides in and out of your pocket easily with this case . 
it would be very difficult to miss hearing it . 
i haven t had it drop a call or a connection yet . 
i recommend this product and the price was great . 
it is the  handiest  thing in my kitchen . 
thick walled with red letters that are easy to read . 
the edges are straight ,  so making stacked cakes is easy . 
glorious color ,  craftmanship and great value for the money . 
hopefully it will last more than that like the old models . 
i avoid washing plastic in dish washer due to high temp . 
i bought this after reading other reviews of different models . 
they are what i need to keep and protect my handknit sweaters in . 
let a stick of butter set out until soft . 
and as long as it  sees  you it won t turn itself off . 
soft rubber case that looks elegant ,  but at a bargain price . 
i can t wait to try that trick again . 
it is a silicone rubber case in addition to a plastic backing . 
this is corelle ,  so you can believe the quality of this product . 
this product is a good buy for the price . 
it will only fit pint and half pint ball jars . 
the descriptions and inflated prices can be very misleading . 
the plastic turning piece is very comfortable and therefore secure in the hand . 
the ice cream holder itself requires about num_extend to freeze prior to use . 
i start the day with three fully charged batteries . 
i was surprised to receive a package via fedex saturday delivery . 
this was purchased for my grandaughter for christmas . 
and bed ,  bath and beyond carry it too . 
the large camera opening prevents glare which some cases can cause . 
they should have a runny yolk inside the firm white . 
i drive a truck for a living and i always need these . 
this is my num_extend one ,  just wanted anotha color . 
all bb buttons are usable through raised ribbed buttons in the silicon skin . 
these did not cost much but are just what i needed . 
so sad when people write reviews and blame the product for their mistake . 
many cases that cover the buttons are hard for pressing . 
be sure to hand wash only for long life . 
no lip ,  so easy to swipe top to flatten . 
the motors are very powerful handling the heaviest dough easily . 
shards of glass from a broken glass are no problem . 
high is somewhat noisy ,  but what you would expect . 
the large bowl is great for salads ,  pasta etc . 
i ve order several of these pans ,  different sizes . 
many ovens are way off and we can easily make the small adjustment . 
this case did not allow the elements to get to the phone . 
my only problem ?  i just bought some nice metalic kitchenaid nonstick bakeware . 
they are great !  i leave them out all the time . 
function : these are amazing if you do any baking . 
the holmes is quiet ,  quiet ,  powerfull and heavy construction . 
what else can you say about a cutting board !  . 
they are indeed sharp !  i ve had no mishaps yet . 
handle is spot welded on is comfortable to hold . 
this is absolutely one of my favorite kitchen tools . 
using this product in my work vehicle which has limited space . 
regarding the quality of this pan ,  i have absolutely no complaints . 
also it is easy to pair and voice quality is good . 
it is very sturdy when on the phone . 
never knew about these ,  till my friend showed me hers . 
easy to install and has a very nice feel . 
you either have to use a sponge or a vacuum cleaner . 
these hanger were exactly what i was looking for . 
its very large ,  bigger than i expected ,  but it is awesome . 
as others have mentioned ,  the top gets extremely hot during cooking . 
does it make a perfect poached egg ?  no . 
i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it . 
basic hands free but great price and great product . 
not recommended for people planning to swap batteries num_extend
this one should fit just about any sink . 
took a few days to get use to . 
i do wish however that it came with a headphone port plug . 
it was the cheapest and it is the best . 
these are the perfect glasses at an affordable price !  . 
now i cannot believe i waited so long . 
i just received my pie pan and i love it . 
i have used this a few times and love it . 
the colors are exactly as described and it is a very durable case . 
the blue light is very pleasant for night drives . 
i just wish it came with a cover like the round one did . 
my wife has severe alergies eppy pin and all . 
i struggled over which rice cooker to buy . 
tried without doing so and cake occasionally stuck in ridges . 
the bride and groom really love it and use it almost every day . 
is easy to clean and takes up just a small space . 
now it s a snap to make orange brownies or lemon bars . 
i have limited counter space and this is storage block is wonderful . 
therefore it will be compatible with your typically breaker system . 
i ve had the num_num air purifier for a little over a month . 
i have yet to see another dock that does this ,  but . 
this met expectations and was not overly expensive . 
i am happy i bought this and would recommend it . 
inexpensive and not as tough to separate as i thought it would be . 
but there is one looming issue yet resolved; durability . 
this machine is pretty loud ,  but nothing too unbearable . 
plan to get one for my daughter for her new apartment !  . 
i bought one for my wife and one for my daughter . 
it s wide enough but not quite long enough . 
but now my water has no smell and tastes unbelievable . 
i store things in mason jars ,  even for the freezer . 
i just love this product  !   . nothing sticks to it . 
worked as it should and decent phone for me . 
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my sister in law . 
i have had this pan for num_num months now . 
the iphone num_num was never a num_extend capable phone . 
as far as can openers go ,  this fits that bill perfectly . 
it would just hang out in space and felt and looked strange . 
they need to be sharpened right out of the box . 
like this tool for doing designs on the sides of my cake . 
i use it every couple months without problems and do enjoy using it . 
she apologized and within num_num days i received two new batteries . 
you can t beat the value you are getting . 
this pan has an aluminum core to solve that problem . 
so far i have only used one and still have num_num saved up . 
suction alone will not match the beater bar in a stand up . 
and did i mention ,  it s easy to make ?  . 
this is by far my favorite accesory to my dutch oven . 
words cannot express how much i love this kettle after previous disastrous experiences . 
i never have to worry about smudges or fingerprints on my cell phone . 
not very protective though its a litle thin . 
i got this to cut fresh squash and it works great . 
this machine allows us to have fresh bread every two days . 
i use my phone all day and it never needs the charger . 
i have learned to always keep a few extra on hand . 
fits my ear perfect and the sound quality is great . 
they stay put well and are loud enough to hear my music . 
this machine does the work and does it at the right time . 
i would like to see how it can go unplugged . 
this is a large rig that works well . 
this is a great price for a otterbox . 
it has held up durability wise and still looks great . 
it ias light ,  stays sharp ,  and is easy to sharpen . 
i purchased this product for my daughter ,  and she liked it . 
my daughter stole these from me and now won t give them back . 
there is a brake button to stop the action if you wish . 
make sure to follow the instructions when putting the thing on your screen . 
i have friends that own a chinese drive thru . 
sleek and beautiful ,  the machine was utterly incapable of making good espresso . 
i also have heavy duty af shaped as a cover for the top . 
the good thing is ,  it doesn t turn veggies into mush . 
i am just happy they can cook with them . 
works great for me and was very easy to assemble . 
it charges in the same amount of time as standard battery . 
these num_extend chargers work great if you are looking for a good laugh . 
no other brand has held up so well . 
i have used the num_extend for several years as my only coffee pot . 
it is a bit pricey but well worth the money . 
the rubber seal came out of the dishwasher brown . 
i may buy another set for myself to use . 
i usually just use email or remove the sd card for huge files . 
nor would it pick up the cheerios left by my toddler . 
it had a good non stick seasoning on it . 
like many other newbies ,  i wonder why i waited so long . 
i then put the lid on and stack the bowls in my cupboard . 
all it took was a use of the minosharp in between . 
i glad i happened across it and got it . 
this is truly like cutting thru hot butter . 
this steamer is about the only piece i never owned . 
not totally surprising since there s no microphone near the mouth . 
i ordered three of these for my church . 
this may be my favorite attachment for the kitchenaid . 
i carefully pour hot water into the skillet while it is still hot . 
but it s a little course for everyday sharpening . 
i suffered none of the problems other users were reporting . 
i never knew food could be chopped so fast . 
the lid fits really tight and it has a nice wide bottom . 
buy this fan unit and revel in the funk it brings . 
we got rid of a bunch of pfaltzgraff junk and got the corelle . 
this is one of the highest rated items on amazon . 
good case ,  the glitter holds on pretty well . 
it resists fingerprints and doesn t affect the touch sensitivity at all . 
dan s review ,  it s epic and a must read . 
and the assortment of additional pieces available is great . 
despite the graduated levels it was relatively easy to clean . 
this replacement battery brought it back to num_num full days . 
very sharp blades and incredibly easy to use . 
the color is great !  i like it very much . 
i feel the need to follow up on my earlier review of dec . 
nice weight and great design for measuring cups . 
i agree with other reviewers about the lack of a handle . 
works like a charm ,  even on thick crusts . 
after num_num years my original screwpull finally broke . 
this is a great vacuum for the dorms . 
the angle on the hooks made hanging my pots and pans difficult . 
turns a num_num min nightmare into a num_num sec dream . 
while the product quality is good ,  these num_num shapes are really large . 
this is a nice solid spoon for every day use . 
juicer is powerful for citrus fruits and works very well . 
i bought this to overcome that problem and it works as advertised . 
i really love it and its worth every penny . 
i got the black rubber laza case for it at the same time . 
been using it to store my meals for the week . 
the rubber sides are not tight but fit the case fine . 
the family has enjoyed having it and easy for everyone to use . 
this phone case is the best case i have owned . 
love the angle of the handle in relation to the blade . 
it fits great ,  but easy to put on and take off . 
this is deep enough to prevent splatters and the perfect size . 
it really should have came from kitchenaide this way . 
another addition to my kitchen inventory to assist with my baking needs . 
this was not a problem because the case covers that and is unseen . 
ours have been slowly going dull and eventually useless . 
i returned it and chose the bodum . that was one month ago . 
just like any other screen cover i have gotten . 
i also prefer a product that is tweakable and beefy . 
we make coffee no other way ,  and swear by it . 
 : d a point to note :  it s very heavy . 
comparing them to other so called num_extend batteries this is awsome . 
i use this with my verizon iphone num_extend
this takes our organic popcorn and in minutes cooks it to perfection . 
we use this every morning now instead of our drip coffee maker . 
i love this product and i use it often . 
the salt shaker is a little more of a challenge . 
i decorated my kitchen in the paprika color . 
attach the num_num parts together or whatever it is . 
have used the waffle maker every weekend since i got it . 
like night and day compared to the toastmaster . 
definitely takes a little practice to master the skill of inserting them . 
our daughter s room was covered in salt powder . 
the instructions clearly state that there is no automatic shutoff . 
it s slim and small enough to fit in the diaper bag . 
thankfully i wasn t sorry !  this panini maker is awesome . 
it fits the phone like a glove and has a great feel . 
water lever ,  but you really don t need it . 
and with all its other faults ,  made bad coffee . bottom line . 
my girlfriend and i each got an iphone num_extend and needed a case . 
i have summarized my observations of this product num_extend
the more i looked ,  the more i had to prioritize my needs . 
the led should be lit when there is contact with the bb . 
it s a phone ,  nice ,  small ,  powerful and good . 
i love these pots and pans from farberware . 
as soon as i canceled that my charging port gave out . 
this seemed like the best option and it seems to do the job . 
gave this to my grandma as a present for her new iphone . 
this one came quickly and only missed two days of coffee . 
i love these so much that i actually kept them for myself . 
right now ,  i mostly make steak and potatoes in it . 
i always research products and read reviews on them . 
i found i missed it and bought this model a month ago . 
this is a perfect strong quality product that i wouldn t be without . 
not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly . 
just hit the  add to shopping cart  button and start dreaming . 
i only bought this because of the heavily discounted price for my old num_extend
parrot num_extend num_extend and num_extend are the same except for the display . 
not much else to say ,  it s a cheese slicer . 
i have yet to replace anything from them . 
contacted amazon and as always their customer care department really does care . 
you can microwave them without ruining them  like plastic  . 
pull both ends out simultaneously to avoid a jam . 
this is just another part of my lodge cast iron collection . 
this is a super product for those of use who still prefer butter . 
and turning the knob to open the can is effortless . 
i actually had to take the battery out . 
caution :  this item qualifies for super saver shipping . 
these have performed very well and have never lost vacuum for us . 
she goes through them quickly ,  so i got her two . 
i decided to see for myself if i preferred riced potatoes . 
i just ordered this so i can have a completely black case . 
not bad for the money just as good as the expensive ones . 
this pan came to me perfectly seasoned and ready go . 
i have never been disappointed in any piece of lodge i have bought . 
i will probably have to take advantage of that lifetime warranty . 
simply great product to be used with the iphone . 
the sound quality is quite good and has excellent range . 
i bought this item after reading all reviews on amazon . com . 
i bought this primarily to use with skype . 
with both devices ,  i have had no issues . 
i totally agree with everyone who gave it such high reviews . 
it has great suction ,  easy to maneuver ,  easy to clean filter . 
other than this we like it and are happy to have gotten it . 
bought this for my mother as a gift . 
this essential kitchen spatula makes the art of flipping delicate dishes a snap . 
i used olive oil and it was fantastic !  . 
never scratches your cell phone and it is so easy to use . 
the operating system is lightning fast; music and movies play silky smooth . 
so when i got home i immediately started looking these up . 
this does the trick for what i needed . 
fits well ,  looks nice ,  and still shows apple logo on back . 
oh ,  i got mine from qvc num_num for num_num inclusive of shipping . 
i am lucky to get a full day out of it . 
so i have to find another antenna i can install outside for reception . 
it s lightweight and easy to transport and store . 
it s everything i thought it would be and more . 
what a difference this is to my old zester . 
some reviewers complained about the flexibility of the handles but mine are stiffer . 
i would still recommend it to a friend . 
it is reliable ,  fast ,  and easy to clean . 
i also use it when cutting meat especially when deboning or filleting fish . 
this can opener is as good as folks claim . 
the original has better sound and a useful analog volume control . 
this battery pack extends the life of our devices . 
my ipad had no problems recognizing this as a valid charger . 
i use it on my home made pizza . 
they were packaged well and were delivered in perfect condition . 
bento container num_extend days after i mailed out the broken one  . 
 i wash mine in dishwasher and no signs of rust or anything  . 
the phone had a % charge when i connected the num_extend
led flash is very bright ,  it will light any num_extend
i would recommend them to my family and friends . 
drinking straws ,  etc ,  the orifinal haskets had started to dry out . 
just your run of the mill micro usb cable . 
i ve tried nearly a dozen car chargers for my ipod touch . 
he says they are pretty good quality and would order them again . 
grease goes into the grease tray ,  works nice . 
with never go back to heavy stoneware again . 
when you reach maximum volume ,  the headset says ,   maximum volume  . 
these same num_num count melitta filters were num_extend at my local publix today . 
it can be immersed in the sink for cleaning . 
we bought this to replace our older cuisinart popcorn popper . 
i couldn t have asked for a better colander . 
my concern with the purchase of the evo num_extend was battery life . 
hole is large enough that it doesn t wrinkle up scarf . 
it also protected my ipod when my num_num pound dog stepped on it . 
it is wonderful surprise that this works so well . 
this is why my true score of this phone is a num_extend
i searched for this for my father for years . 
as long as you re not looking to use your cd player . 
i guess i had a bottle a litte to big for it . 
i had a powerful but loud window fan . 
recommended if your looking for a small french press . 
if you have a filter or even tea strainer you can use that . 
i was very pleased with the dyson s transition from carpeting to linoleum . 
i can t say enough about how handy these are . 
i can t imagine not having this in my kitchen . 
sometimes the measuring marks are even printed off kilter . 
i now have two paella pans and two cooling racks . 
they arrived on february num_extend which was a pleasant surprise . 
just push and get on with your morning . 
i can also use one to hold my memory sticks and sd cards . 
num_extend i wouldn t mind if the racks were maybe an inch taller . 
the cable is thicker than any recharging cable i have . 
we got these for our bathroom exhaust fans and they work just fine . 
these are a gift for my nephew who loves root beer . 
it has a comfortable ,  solid feel to it . 
this is a summertime favorite around our house . 
i read some reviews on here that had some helpful tips . 
it is so awesome ! syncing is great as usual . 
it is well built and last a long time . 
this case is probably the best one i ve seen for the num_extend
with wifi ,  i am closer to num_num mbps downstream num_extend
took a while to ship but it was worth the waite . 
i use this for my ipod touch num_extend generation . 
much healthier than using the microwave popcorn packages . 
he loves it and it has kept a charge . 
i m going to keep looking through reviews ,  hoping for an explanation . 
i like the non stick inside that it provides . 
this is the absolute best holster for the thunderbold . 
no signs of rust though have tried to keep it dry . 
the very top edge flares to make a lip . 
i used to use plastic spoons because i used nonstick cookware . 
i use a heaping tablespoon per cup and get a better flavor . 
i use this egg poacher quite often as i love poached eggs . 
this is a dream for cooking novice s such as myself . 
i have a cord for home and car . 
i have ordered several and i may continue to be a return customer . 
it s weird how it works but it works and i love it . 
 yuck ,  yuck  actually ,  the fan works very well . 
it grills evenly and the cover keeps any spatter inside the grill . 
this pen is actually a pen ,  and a nice pen at that . 
a perfect omega shaped chocolate layer in every slice . 
after all you did pay more for the phone didn t you ?  . 
not only potatoes but other root crops as well like carrots and yams . 
it sounds like a normal fan does on high . 
but for working in smaller carpeted areas and rooms ,  this is perfect . 
this is a nicely designed and excellent performance bluetooth headset . 
not to mention the fact that it will probably discolor as it ages . 
it does this exceedingly well ,  and switches easily to the bare floor . 
i am very happy with my oster steamer . 
if you need a decent backup battery look no further than this one . 
for those familiar with otterbox ,  this case is of equal build quality . 
am looking forward to picking up the lawnmower and garden tool unit next . 
i use it for any veggies or fruits . 
i am very pleasantly surprised with this sleek . 
its also not reflective at all which is expected . 
for a piece of white plastic ,  it s expensive . 
this salad spinner is a gem and my second one i bought . 
where did the bubble go ?  i do not know . 
now i want to buy their external laptop battery . 
i had num_num apples peeled ,  sliced and cored in no time . 
fits like a glove and is not bulky . 
this is a nice num_num foot long cable . 
it comes with so many attachments which is great . 
i wish it could be disabled . overall i m very satisfied . 
i don t have any problems with the turbo . 
but it has held up very well with my frequent use . 
this case fits onto the captivate very snugly and perfectly . 
i just lay it flat on my desk . 
been looking for docking station for htc inspire . 
i bought this because it makes enough to serve company . 
i had the original version where the pitcher and unit were round . 
so ,  i have replaced it with this gleaming trio . 
the product was delivered on time and the transaction was smooth . 
time will tell how well the new silicon gasket works . 
some have complained about the lid falling out . 
higher amps don t force current into a device any faster . 
it does what i wanted so i m happy with this purchase . 
the paint wears off but that was expected with such a cheap price . 
heavy and definately made to use if you want to . 
i bought the set for general purpose cooking and plating . 
once i did ,  i ll never use another can opener . 
actually ,  i prefer the paper filters as they re disposable . 
lids fit perfectly and its nice to use glass instead of plastic . 
my first set of corelle took me num_num years to break a few . 
i may still add a urethane skin to the glass . 
vegetables taste fresh and also come out great . 
the clip works great to actually hold it to the visor too . 
don t let them get too dirty or the performance will suffer . 
also ,  the headphones were comfortable and didn t hurt after long use . 
no more poked fingers rummaging through the drawer . 
this is a correction to my previous review . 
after reading reviews i purchased this for my kitchen . 
i totally regretted not getting it for myself earlier . 
bought this awhile ago and used it for about num_num weeks . 
these are not cheap thin tin they are heavy and solid . 
from heating up items ,  to full chicken dinners its the best . 
manufacturer got it right ,  seller also gets a nod of the head . 
keeps everything in its place during prep and baking . 
i bought this cover for my girlfriend s sprint pixi . 
it is also all metal and seems of higher quality . 
i wish that it would of came with the pan . 
have used it for more than just eggs . 
we keep it hung in the fridge to monitor the temp . 
i can t always find ground chicken in my market . 
she wouldn t use the microwave egg poacher i bought her . 
i overdid it and warped the hell out of my frame . 
i don t think they would be durable for every day use . 
great universal mount for $ it detaches and reattaches to my windshield easily . 
overall ,  well worth the money in my opinion . 
the tools in this kit are all built very well . 
a little pricey but can t argue for the quality . 
the chemex is my preferred method of coffee making . 
i would rate these num_num stars if i could . 
the handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything . 
i purchased these since i travel a lot . 
the knife has an excellent balance and a heavy weight in the hand . 
i need five more words to submit this . 
very easy to clean with its removable tray . 
i cannot imagine having a touch screen phone without screen protectors . 
i also use it for sausage ,  veggies ,  chicken breasts ,  chops . 
but i m pleased with it and use it multiple times daily . 
the coffee is so delicious and it looks great on my counter . 
a quick rinse under running water is all it needs for most cleanup . 
and it looks good sitting on my countertop . 
i almost hate to use them ,  they re wonderful . 
sharp enough to send you to the hospital . 
and most chargers for home use are rated right at num_extend
it is super easy to use and maintain . 
plugs into outlet and you may cook indoor or out . 
it is quite a bit of cloth that is included . 
the hubber s and i are huge popcorn lovers . 
the faberware num_num piece set goes well with it    .  .  .    . 
this is a great addition to my kitchen . 
so i figured it was time for an upgrade . 
recipient is very pleased with quality and convenience . 
this one does the job ,  and rapidly charges your devices . 
the bottom pan has a heavy bottom ,  which i didn t expect . 
it s frigging annoying ,  but again ,  still worth it  . 
i would say that s a pretty big improvement . 
i m still working on the quality of my coffee . 
i really love this headset for both it s sound quality and comfortableness . 
i just throw them in the dishwasher and they do not rust . 
these covers are perfect and exactly as pictured . 
everyone should have one or more pyrex measuring cups in their kitchen . 
i have been using this to strain homemade broth . 
glad my sunbeam busted  after one year use  . 
i will be ordering more when i need more . 
if you want the handles to remain beautiful and strong ,  hand wash . 
very handy !  love the swivel head and it s very light weight . 
i recommend this product; we use it almost every day with the kids . 
when the external battery dies it switches to the main battery . 
we retired in florida and about half of our flooring is tile . 
otherwise ,  i m sure it s fine on the correct machine . 
the iphone and its case were in no way affected by the fall . 
i ve been using this for a while now . 
surprisingly effective on carpets because of the brush roller . 
i love my ear buds ,  i m very into my music . 
got the battery ,  charged it for num_num minutes and started using it . 
they make great gifts to people who like to cook . 
henckels top of the line ,  but a great quality knife . 
too pricey and the shipping cost was way too high . 
also ,  one case was slightly ripped and discolored  manufacturing defect ,  perhaps  . 
for us ,  the best things about this product are as num_extend
but it sometims hurt my eyes under sunshine . 
the velcro flap closure securely holds the phone and is easy to open . 
shut down at num_extend pm with % power left on the battery . 
i like handle on the top of the fan . 
flashlight wasn t that bright ,  but could be used in emergency . 
they will last a lifetime from what i can tell . 
the rubber grip on the handle ensures you have good control . 
decided to treat myself to these and dont regret it . 
 she loves hers too !  i would recommend buying this mixer . 
it s sturdy and safe on the furniture surfaces . 
i have one at home and one at the office . 
holds probabaly about num_num to num_num cups of coffee in whole beans . 
this appears to be the weakest part of the case . 
you can hold the handle after heating because it isn t too hot . 
i haven t contacted the seller about it yet . 
but this takes out the foam which straight turkish drinker love . 
wonderful product that worked great for the life of my num_extend phone . 
we use this to serve ice water at meals . 
it comes with a reusable filter which saves money . 
we are going to buy more stuff from oxo . 
this plantronics voyager pro is the best bluetooth i have owned . 
i have bought from this seller at least twice now . 
put kids meals on with a marker or engraver to avoid loss . 
the front seemed to scratch easier than the back . 
anyway ,  this product is easy to use and works very well . 
i ve had my fair share of eye squirts from this bad boy . 
this was an addition to my other wusthof classic knifes and accessories . 
it makes the phone rugged yet still fully functional . 
may be if user fingers are very large . 
hopefully they will stay sharp as they are right now . 
it works well and like a toaster should . 
because it s so small ,  it s not too heavy at all . 
corks are removed easily and cleanly every time . 
i have punished it on many occasions and it still looks brand new . 
this is a nice ,  well made wok ring . 
i could just eat the whole batch by myself . 
it fits snug so it can t get lose or fall out . 
i needed a larger one to be able to cook larger portions . 
i keep my bacon grease in it handy on the stove . 
this was easy enough for my little one to use easily . 
it s great to carry on picnics or to the lake . 
as another reviewer pointed the picture is slightly off for this item . 
bialetti makes high quality stove top espresso and they last long . 
it is a great device for the price and has cool features . 
it feels great ,  it stabs great ,  it looks great . 
well i have unlimited data so that is not a problem . 
nicely done capresso; i definitely recommend this grinder . 
the phone is awesome and can do a lot . 
after hours of reading reviews i made my decision . 
spend the extra money for the peace of mind . 
that is how much i love this product . 
the hinged lids allow for a very big sandwich to fit . 
nice light crust on the outside and flaky inside . 
num_extend a batch of cookies from the booklet ,  pretty good . 
bought this set to go with a set i already have . 
i was skeptical ,  but gave it a try . 
it did exactly what we wanted it to do . 
that lock works great and is easy to operate . 
i don t hear any noticeable hissing during quiet sections . 
not some fake  motorola cons : it doesn t taste all that good . 
this fit the bill perfectly and cooked beautifully . 
loved the price and the size of these spoons . 
it is very intelligent and easy to program and operate . 
this really is a fantastic product and well worth the money . 
if you want thicker slices you have to buy a larger slicing disc . 
is the blink supposed to be fast or slow . 
it covers my phone well and provides adequate protection . 
i didn t want this ,  and looked for a solution . 
i have always been pleased with oxo products . 
all the spoken commands make things easy as well . 
this charger worked exactly as it should have . 
great for use simply as a cookie sheet . 
this gave me % in about an hour and a half . 
oven mitts ,  notes ,  recipe cards ,  small bags of spices . 
case is exactly like i thought it would be . 
the lid does not disappoint ,  it seals tightly and lifts of easily . 
it s also easy to clean which is a bonus  :   . 
i thought there was just no such thing . 
still a pretty good deal for the price . 
unfortunately ,  you can t have the best of both worlds . 
yes ,  num_extend is ok if the optimal voltage is num_extend
we liked it well enough to buy two more . 
i did not find anything i d call bizare . 
after years of debating ,  i finally bought this flatware set . 
i have an enclume bar which is far nicer and designed much better . 
excellent for zesting and grating food and spices in the kitchen . 
i make kefir milk from kefir grains and raw cow and goat milks . 
my observations are listed num_extend they seem water resistant . 
avoid abrasive cleaners and scrubbers ,  and dry the tray right away . 
nice addition to the end table in our family room . 
this is my third bluetooth earpiece ,  after theplantronics voyager num_extend theplantronics voyager num_extend
i ve returned one because the top didn t close well . 
i highly recommend the benriner jananese mandoline slicer . 
it is greatly made ,  great quality ,  great buy !  . 
great fit and function and plenty of quality to last up to abuse . 
the sound quality is just as good as my apple headphones . 
i ve been very pleased with the performance of this pan . 
it toasts properly and the bagel setting is just right . 
i will post a photo of how the holes look at the bottom . 
i have never turned out a bad loaf of bread in this unit . 
except when people forget to fill it up !  . 
handle ,  lid and spout are heavy ,  thick plastic . 
have had an old sunbeam mixer that was worn out . 
this is a great budget conical burr grinder ,  possibly the best . 
this makes it so easy to quickly cook an egg in the morning . 
i can really get in there and scrape the bowl . 
i would know because i ve purchased numerous devices multiple times . 
the wall charger shipped with the galaxy s ii works great . 
i had a big mess on my hands . 
it doesn t leak if you get the lid screwed on right . 
the price is reasonable ,  and it arrived well packaged and when promised . 
unlimited power ,  unlimited speed choices ,  and this thing does it all . 
belkin makes good stuff and this reflects that . 
my old blender could not handle the challenge . 
it a perfect replacement tray for iphone num_extend
we somehow managed to wreck the gasket seal for our blender . 
the sound that comes out of it is super loud and terribly distorted . 
it fits perfectly ,  does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
i bought these to use in my wok . 
in the end ,  though ,  i did just buy a new one . 
so we recently bought these two graters  this one and the coarse  . 
i especially like the small ,  soft nipple that fits into the ear . 
straining the oil seems to take more time and patience than anything else . 
the coffee does drip very slowly through ,  though . 
the size is great for extra room ,  and really big tarts . 
twice now i ve lost the phone while sitting down . 
if you slice ,  dice ,  or chop ,  you need this knife . 
i was skeptical at first but wanted to try . 
i have the samsung galaxy num_extend also with sprint . 
like the magnetic clip also that keeps it closed . 
that s the problem i don t think you can sharpen this knife . 
the one advantage of the num_extend is the amazing battery life . 
i have had no issues with this case . 
i hate the serrated crap knives most often bought by people . 
they are pretty pastel colors and flexible and will last . 
i certainly couldn t tell you and i can t think about it . 
i like how the head connects to the handle . great tool . 
heats up quickly and the copper bottom is great . 
we ve had this stone for about a week now . 
this tool is very versatile for my italian wine collection . 
after selling it all ,  i decided to buy a new set . 
at times the revolution was faster then the thunderbolt . 
the list of reasion to have this phone is endless . 
i used to dread making batters until these whisks . 
that s good enough for four stars in my book !  . 
it cooks well but is a little hard to clean . 
i had an extra blade assembly on hand that solved the problem . 
i have made linguine ,  angel hair and ravioli with great success . 
there s sizes perfect for sandwich cookies , sugar cookies and biscuits . 
so i ve purchased this based on ap s recommendation . 
did not know there was such a pan . 
i ve had this machine since july num_extend with no problems . 
allows maximum leverage of the wire against the cheese . 
the timer setting and drip stop features work flawlessly . 
its very small and very comfortable to wear . 
yes ,  it did land at the perfect angle to produce a dent . 
got a great price on the lightning deal . 
it took me a few tries to screw the middle poles together . 
that appliance was trouble from the get go . 
they go crazy for them . absolutely nothing cooks like cast iron . 
it s also sized for just the right amount of butter . 
i couldn t believe how inexpensive an oem battery was for the pre . 
i wish this were just a bit bigger . 
but ,  it is hard to take out of my phone case . 
this can proved useful for slicing cucumbers ,  carrots and the like . 
the lip has a rolled edge but it s done really well . 
it runs quiet and doesn t heat up the whole kitchen . 
no issues at all with this and it fits that phone really well . 
it had a bigger bowl and was a little bit stronger . 
when i received this product i didn t know what to think . 
as my daughter has a similar one ,  he was  borrowing  . 
each one having issues that makes them almost unusable to me . 
this one is the first which has neither problem . 
blend until smooth and sweeten to taste with splenda or granular sugar . 
enjoy it for years and generations to come !  . 
love the preprinted labels for the jar tops . 
accidently broke the num_num cup carafe for my cuisinart . 
it is perfect for omelets ,  pancakes ,  french toast ,  grilled cheese . 
i returned the mount back to verizon and bought this one instead . 
rinse it immediately after use and wash with a soft cloth or sponge . 
have not used it much but when i do it works as advertised . 
looks nice sitting out on the range too . 
gonna gonna gonna ,  forget the future what about now . 
but soon i realized that it is really cool and fast to use . 
it is still working as you can see from your device . 
these mugs are great !  we have a plum and turquoise mug . 
larger grippy handle is great ,  brush cleans items well . 
since then it has stayed put and is much easier to use . 
that s heaven for a reluctant cook like myself . 
we needed the additional charge cable and this one worked as described . 
it has a matt rubbery texture that provides good grip . 
the slim filter does have a reduced capacity vs the standard pitcher . 
there are no signs of wear and tear after num_num months . 
i have all pine floors with a few area rugs . 
it looks solidly built ,  and i ve had no problems with it . 
it takes less than num_num seconds to wash . 
now i just need the num_num ounce bowls to complete my set . 
i bought this charger a few years ago . 
easy to get in and out of pocket . 
presto !  never have i had another boil over . 
it managed the switch between the computer and phone almost seamlessly . 
bought for a gift and it is better than mine . 
the color is just as described :  hot pink . 
this is a very nice set of headphones for $
the product is easy to use and setup . 
headset was shipped and arrived before expected date . 
i love pyrex and this is just as expected . 
they clip stuff and then stick to metal things . 
rests pretty comfortably on the ear and is great for group chat . 
did some research and this product came highly recommended so i bought it . 
i ve had three and i tell all my friends to get this . 
i would highly recommend this for great protection . 
however ,  i only use it in my car . 
these work perfectly and they really keep the outside sounds out . 
like other reviewer said that this is not the best quality product . 
however ,  it s literally a pin with a handle on it . 
this cable makes it very easy to charge your phone or transfer files . 
it fits so well ,  i sometimes forget it is in my ear . 
no streaks and the glass is crystal clear clean . 
i am perfectly satisfied with device and trust that you will be also . 
i can now drink coffee without the oil that irritates my stomach . 
these ones definitely do ,  and they fit perfectly . 
and cushions a fall in all the right places . 
they also stored easily in my kitchen drawer . 
but ,  it gets the job done and was reasonable in price . 
greasing always left burned on stains on my cookie sheets over time . 
assembly was easy and i suppose the parts might hold out . 
yes ,  the velcro is noisy ,  but i expected that . 
now it has a home and we point that out to them . 
it is a high quality product and adjusted to my drawer very well . 
i dont need a data plan to use it . 
easy to use and was easy to assemble . 
when he calls i can not hear any back ground noise . 
i was looking for a set of wireless headphones to wear at work .

i m very satisfied with the performance of the hoover . 
i have purchased previous versions for other phones . 
fast ship ,  powerful functionality . most relevant num_num online purchasing . 
the seal is silicone and seems like it will hold up very well . 
it s very snug ,  but is easy to put on and remove . 
i have had many compliments on his bowl . 
i plan on getting one in all the colors i like . 
this is a good replacement part for the cracked piece in my blender . 
just on the top of the rod and you cannot eliminate that problem . 
it was exactly what i was looking for . 
the current one is thicker ,  heavier and more robust . 
i know it costs more but the real thing is the real thing . 
and for verizon phones it has a cut out for the side . 
for the price a great item ,  will buy more . 
the case was smashed a little but still usable . 
being able to grate in both directions is just a nice bonus . 
though those don t have the nice grips that these ones do . 
the precision was better with this pen than with the targus model . 
this is a really nice cup which has a positive seal . 
i have eaten salad many times since purchasing it . 
it s also a makes a much better appearance than the photo . 
this phone case is almost identical to the otterbox iphone case . 
i seems as if one of the parts came loose inside . 
it was my first fiestaware piece and i am hooked . 
the blades do not rust .  .  . i like that num_extend
after much agonizing ,  we  i  chose the zo  breadmaker . 
these unique measuring spoons are designed to get into the small openings . 
i get a lot of compliments and it is very durable . 
after a little stretching it has turned out to be pretty good . 
the case itself is durable and provides great protection for the phone . 
you can adjust it as you see fit including vertical vs . 
and now i wanted one . so i bought one for myself . 
easy to clean ,  therefore no more dirty mitts between regular washings . 
can be mounted almost anywhere in the car  not only the windshield  . 
i chose num_extend but feel that is a bit small . 
they do not fit snugly which is fine for our use . 
it is more shallow than a dutch oven . 
the cord is fairly long and allows for placement near anywhere . 
i use mine all the time to beat eggs for making omelets etc . 
the glass is heavy duty  dropped a few times and no breaks  . 
i only wish these bowls came in a slightly wider size . 
it should really be consumed same day or close to that . 
interference :  i ve never had interference on a bt headset . 
the tray is made of good quality wood . 
it s very useful and the set comes at a great price . 
num_extend speeds are excellent in the right location ,  but terrible in others . 
the circular connector doesn t fit on this device at all . 
i kept adding num_num seconds and watching the bacon in between . 
seems to have a magnet inside to hold knives in place . 
i am saving money and also the environment . 
the case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone . 
the microphone is incredibly sensitive but not overly so . 
why ?  ease of use is reason number one . 
the fibron handle has a strong grip and prevents slipping . 
use it liberally and in the beginning ,  use it often . 
this is the best buy i have ever purchased for my kitchen . 
easy to use and doesn t take up a lot of space . 
the device comes with three earpieces  small ,  medium and large  . 
sound quality is good ,  mic works ,  and the remote works . 
takes very little space in my glove box when not in use . 
also the music sounds fantastic ,  crystal clear ,  very impressed . 
i just spent the last month trialing num_num different bluetooth headsets . 
this product was highly recommended by cooks illustrated . 
overall i am pretty happy with this cleaner .

this seems like it will be a great screen protector !  . 
i would definitely buy from this seller again . 
it keeps the pots and pans you use most often within easy reach . 
exactly what i wanted and bakes my banana bread to super perfection . 
this is for a real man to cook with . 
for one ,  maybe two people it works great . 
these were just enough to keep my treo from moving . 
that just made more things to wash up . 
it isn t cast iron nor does it say it is . 
there is no odd taste and we have never had any malfunctioning cartridges . 
fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky . 
it is almost exactly like tinting your own windows . 
both get almost daily use ,  and i wouldn t use anything else . 
this is ok if you never make espresso . 
i liked it so much i bought a set for my sister . 
they are so cute and the price was great . 
i bought two because one was not enough for all my spices . 
the size is clearly marked on the handle . 
last i peeled off the layer labeled num_extend front  . 
luckily that s not the case for this one . 
aside from that ,  everyone has reported that i sound clear . 
these are the absolute best measuring cups i ve ever seen . 
this is a safe recommendation for any steak lover . 
the heating feature is very nice and seems to help with cleaning . 
this is definitely a must have kitchen tool !  .

i will recommend it anyone that like their lettuce crisp . 
go to theessentials . com and you can find them there . 
the sound quality is excellent and the battery life is very good . 
we use filtered water for our fancy coffee maker . 
they roll well and are far smaller than most rolling shower curtain rings . 
i m a num_num year old that is not exactly made of money . 
got everything  measuring wise  at the same time . 
it can be cleaned by wiping with a soft cloth or paper towel . 
i use it with coarse ground coffee and it pours fine . 
it was $  where did they all go ?  ?  ?   . 
everything fits perfectly and all buttons work with the case on . 
i have had it a year with no complaints at all . 
it gets hotter than any regular wok i ve ever used . 
using again for our travels and we love it . 
i love using just one bluetooth for both phones . 
these cut things well and if they get dull ,  buy more . 
much bigger than average thermos ,  which is what i needed . 
so this little spinner is just right for small salads . 
i had one of these and it broke . 
measuring honey or corn syrup  mmm ,  pecan pie  is easy with these . 
by far ,  i like this phone the best . 
other than that sma imperfection i love it !  !  . 
these protectors are very nice and cover the entire screen . 
only used so far for coffee but it works fine .

i got this for my razr num_num num_extend which uses the micro usb . 
works well ,  easy to clean ,  and an attractive finish . 
you really can t beat the pyrex for functionality ,  looks and durablitly .

it also has an additional compartment for spare batteries or accessories . 
i would qualified it as perfect ,  no flaws . 
there are two button controls on the handle which engage the cleaning solution . 
great jar ,  works great for lots of things .

this is the second anker battery that i have purchased . 
just make sure you use a good type of cotton candy sugar . 
easy to work and boy does it work . 
the case looks much better than what the product pictures show for it . 
i love using it for fruit ,  herbs and veggies . 
bought it for my wife who goes through these things like water . 
okay it is a little loud but don t let that discourage you . 
if it s already paired it will just connect to your device . 
let s be honest ,  it s advertised on an infomercial . 
you can t be afraid of using your stove burner here . 
i got it perfect and didn t run out . 
it s just small enough to hold a dish towel or two . 
i really like this product and intend on using it for a lifetime . 
the cleaning unit is slim enough to go under the sofa ,  etc . 
my son loves this case as do i . 
my num_num quart batter bowl got chipped so it needed to be replaced . 
i like it very much and am very glad i ordered it . 
after num_extend years of use ,  my gasket started to smell stinky . 
heats water much faster than our num_num watt microwave oven . 
the screen on the fuze is amazing with the num_extend resolution . 
the size is perfect for food and snacks . 
over the years i have used numerous bluetooth headsets . 
they make a great table with mu good dishes . 
i really love this step stool and would definitely purchase it again . 
these round cutters are one of the best products i own . 
it also comes in handy at airports when everyone is hogging the outlets . 
this is a num_extend sim card and is needed to activate num_extend
it s slim and tall ,  like any handsome tumbler should be . 
the clock face appears and you re all done for the night . 
doesn t seem to have a lot of protection for drops . 
there s extra room inside for additional items like money and credit cards . 
they are easy to clean and comfortable to use . 
this is by far the best one i have owned . 
the sound quality is amazing for the size of the speaker . 
this cookware set is simply wonderful and is a delight to use . 
wow !  i was surprised when i read the reviews on this product . 
so i purchased this pitcher for its slim design and its perfect . 
decent material ,  no struggle to put it on or take it off . 
we got rid of a bunch of pfaltzgraff junk and got the corelle . 
the only complaint i have is that they are kinda thin . 
the swivel and fold feature of the wall prongs is very nice . 
i love the style and it fits perfectly on my iphone num_extend
i ve had these batteries for about a month now . 
for that reason i tried nissan and am glad that i did . 
not sure what the additional num_num buttons are for on the slider . 
this is a great product and an even greater price . 
if you are using celtic salt i would highly recommend it . 
it does have some issues that are easy to fix . 
the mixing bowls are heavy duty and shaped perfectly for mixing . 
if that works i will buy a second one . 
tenors sounded more vibrant with the etymotics as did jazz guitar rifts . 
i adore mine and appreciate the reviewers that recommended it . 
the cost for the larger press is more than worth it . 
simple clear glass is one way i m making my kitchen toxic free . 
i bought this to use in a candy buffet . 
it s fine for my wife but it is annoying to me . 
i have been looking for red canisters for awhile . 
this is the stuff middle america uses to eat num_num meals a day . 
i wouldn t recommend any other case to droid num_num owners . 
i haven t let my husband use this pan . 
the metal is strong and the gasket is great . 
the on of switch and sensibly placed button are improvements over recent models . 
you can still get one in decent shape . 
similarly ,  the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized . 
checkout this very popular book . the kitchen ninja :  recipe book . 
i highly recommend getting this pan with the liner as well . 
the style of this toaster fits right into my kitchen . 
this matters because there is a variation in the bezel of these models . 
i have two small yorkies that are really hard on my carpet . 
fits perfect in a pocket ,  backpack ,  purse ,  etc . 
still i have learned so much about cake decorating from them . 
the setup is easy ,  and the dock is sturdy . 
this is perfect for measuring out large quantities of fluid . 
i liked the size as it fits nicely in my draw . 
it did what it was supposed to do . 
so i guess it was a good buy . 
a very good cooker for a very reasonable price . 
i hung this off a window and it works great . 
i like to wrap my hands around these on a cold evening . 
it feels nice if it s blowing directly on you . 
you can see why some people have had these for years and years . 
it works great but i do wish it was glass and not plastic . 
i bought this to use with the ka pasta roller attachment . 
i never owned a presssure cooker because i was afraid of them . 
it would be nice if a model was available with a power dock . 
it had a dupont  teflon  coated screw for smoother insertion into the cork . 
i got the pan so i could put gum paste flowers in it . 
pressing the big button will reconnect it to the last connected device . 
num_extend i have an excuse to bake some of my favorite cake donuts . 
it is a great idea for a bunch of potatoes or vegetables . 
i didn t know i needed one of these until i had one . 
i see now i could have bought a smaller one . 
we bought this coffeemaker for our num_extend anniversary . 
it great for those without built in bluetooth in their cars . 
i keep it on my key ring for when i need it . 
works as advertised ,  and i ve had it quite a while . 
so glad we pulled the trigger and bought it on the spot . 
we simply wipe it out with a paper towel . 
it is so good i bought a second one for my husband . 
i researched hand steamers ,  i already have a shark floor steamer . 
i hope i provided a good enough description . 
no more fumbling around with two headsets and tripping over wires . 
i do not pack it very hard at all . 
they are just the right size for our counter . 
great idea ,  great execution ,  great value at the price . 
this works great and is much better than using a plastic spoon . 
we have had this for at least num_num years and its still going . 
today i received the jabra num_extend and the jabra num_extend headsets . 
i like this spoon and it s bigger than i d imagined . 
it makes typing easier because the keyboard on the screen is so small . 
then i went to sears where you can try them before you buy . 
it has proven to be the most often used pan in the cupboard . 
this keeps the counter clear and neater looking . 
i had num_num of them for my previous motorola and really like them . 
i purchased several packets of these for the presto popper i also purchased . 
my only complaint is that the material is a little floppy . 
the previous electric kettle i had was worn out after half the time . 
my old larger one had a slider to adjust the temperature . 
i would recommend the jabra clipper for active use . 
got this as a gift for my husband . 
protects well against drops and is easy to use . 
i would not hesitate to buy anything from them . 
i really liked them and was sad when they stopped working . 
i ve been making pizza like a pro every saturday night . 
installs clear and eliminates dust spots on the screen . 
it cooks quickly ,  and i haven t had any burned corn . 
all of the other apps i tried would do absolutely nothing . 
what a treat to wake up to piping hot oatmeal !  . 
i have used it twice and already it is really scratched up . 
the status light makes this item a real value . 
seems very durable and should hold up well . 
the tube is considerably wider in diameter than the num_extend
decided to try this product without much expectation . 
this skillet is heavy but well worth its weight . 
would buy again blindly without researching anything else . 
but heat up the almond paste a little and it works too . 
once some minor modifications were made ,  the final assembly was straight forward . 
i used the box to return the defective unit to them . 
we love ice tea and have a container in our frig . 
the finish is smooth but provides good traction for your grip . 
my only complaint is the thin filter gets really sharp on the edges . 
i ve been using a sears kenmore num_num cup glass pot . 
meats ,  cheeses and vegetables are sliced well on the machine . 
made of high grade plastic and will hold up for few years . 
this is a great product for that job . 
do be careful the blades are like razors but the guard works perfect . 
lets see how long this last but it was in mint condition . 
i have short curly gray hair and i swim every day . 
the cost was only about a third of what provider wanted . 
i have not yet used the rounded tool . 
no more trying to make makeshift protectors from aluminum foil . 
this cover was just what i was looking for . 
i get compliments and people are always asking where i bought my bluetooth . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
the camera lens and flash are not covered . 
if i slip it could mean a nasty cut . 
works well but doesn t yield fine enough grind for espresso . 
i love products that are not labor intense . 
exceptional material with excellent handiwork on the cathedral designs . 
i must admit i had my doubts at first . 
only downside is is that it s difficult to take off the phone . 
who was complaining his popovers did not turn out right . 
my garmin gps suction cup falls off all the time from the windshield . 
i ve had this toaster for at least num_num or num_num years . 
with the smoothies i put the sticks in immediately . 
i also love the rubberized coating on the back . 
this is the best pasty cutter i have had . 
the peices are heavy without being cumbersome and attractive . 
this little machine works really well for all that . 
only drawback is that it makes the phone heavier than need be . 
it feels sturdy ,  and i can really crank down on it . 
they do the job for whatever you are trying to do . 
i like the twisting mechanism to keep your second cup from over brewing . 
i ended up giving a couple colleagues one and they love them . 
going to buy some of these for everyone in the family . 
a gadget i have to have in the kitchen . 
this is truly the most labor intensive part of this brewing method . 
it has spoiled me and i can no longer drink ordinary restaurant coffee . 
this wouldnt even charge an ipad to %
i even managed to  mush  the suction cups flat . 
at less than $ each after shipping ,  these covers are decently priced . 
def would tell any droid owner to purchase . 
i contacted anker for support and they were great . 
this will stabilize it and keep it higher . 
it doens t make the phone  bigger  and it protects the pack . 
and the wind noise reduction works very well . 
cuts butter quickly ,  however ,  the handle rotates when i push down . 
it s a real hard worker with a very powerful motor . 
just my opinion and not a huge ordeal . 
i have to hold it in place and quickly set the cleaner down . 
we used other cleaners on it and ended up with orange colored stain . 
i don t see me buying ice cream ever again . 
this is a fantastic addition to any kitchen . 
we live in adobe house out in the middle of nowhere . 
the user interfaces on these headsets is invariably terrible . 
a must have for any family ,  or a single guy like me . 
always clean the rubber seal coz ,  it does accumulate food residue . 
work exactly as they should with no problems at all . 
it is thin and does not add bulk to the phone at all . 
this fall the neighbor kids who play in my large yard found it . 
bought this to replace my old one that was num_num years old . 
it wouldn t have added that much size or num_extend
nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do . 
but they do work very well for what they were intended . 
not bad for $ easy to use ,  no problems ,  fast delivery . 
we love this case it hugs your iphone giving the illusion of safety . 
if you are using and transferring to straight talk donot order this phone . 
this is now my go to fry pan . 
this is my second saladshooter and i love it . 
you really don t feel like you are wearing a num_extend
there has been nothing this juicer cannot handle . 
quick and easy to disassemble then put back num_extend
i disagree with one reviewer that the lids are hard to put on . 
and it gives the phone a little bit of a cool look . 
had another one that only lasted a week !  . 
and you cannot drop the phone when using it this way . 
despite making it easier ,  any metal on metal will scratch . 
and for the price ,  you truly cannot go wrong !  . 
i was pleasantly surprised to find all the pieces snapped together without tools . 
i purchased this vacuum after being disappointed by a dyson num_extend
by the way ,  did i mention how affordable it is . 
do not wash in the dishwasher ,  it dulls the blade . 
fresh clean water is always good for you . 
the pouring spout is a bit odd ,  so i always spill some . 
best use is cutting vegetables ,  fruits and bread in a slicing manner . 
no more moving num_num cans around to see if i have beans !  . 
this fit the bill perfectly and even has a status light when charging . 
given the tools we can keep the old traditions going forward . 
it is just a well designed ,  easy to use little egg maker . 
it pours great and seals great and the handle is comfortable to use . 
the back looks good and protects the camera which is a plus . 
it looks like it was made for my kitchen . 
if the marker were more sturdy ,  that wouldn t be necessary . 
this model allowed me to try out canning at a low entry cost . 
i have made over a dozen loaves since it arrived . 
i have bought two of the steamers as gifts after using my unit . 
other methods may be easier ,  but nothing makes coffee like my chemex . 
i used home made yogurt ,  and it has a sweet tart flavor . 
i needed to replace one that was lost in a flood . 
this vacumm turned out to be better than i expected . 
so many great meals she prepared with it . 
at it s price point i really can t ask for anything else . 
i really enjoy the way it makes the pops . 
when i came across this leopard print i had to have this one . 
a thermal machine like this one may not be for everybody . 
i  test drove  it and it seems to be working just fine . 
none of the problems i ve seen other describe . 
i can put in any oil i want . 
i generally use it to mash up walnuts . 
i have plenty of store bought pickled food glass jars without a lid . 
be sure that you are purchasing the classic series . 
these bowls are a great addition to the regular bowls and plates . 
best if all ,  you can bake in the oven with it too . 
perfect little counter top grinder to grind your daily pot of fresh coffee . 
i use this knife almost everyday and it really holds its edge . 
my new office at work has terrible reception . 
it is small and nicely attaches to cup or whatever . 
i bought all my extra equipment at the dollar store . 
this hot air popper pops corn fast and easy . 
this slim brita meets and exceeds my expectations . 
i use this on a num_extend denmark saute  pan . 
still much better than the charger that comes with the blackberry . 
great gift for any college kid ,  or anyone who loves pizza . 
i have rated five stars for design ,  quality and overall satisfaction . 
i have kept the filter in and seldom replace it . 
i found this item on amazon ,  although it was a discontinued item . 
and as mentioned works with cast iron and other seasoned pans . 
the cord is not too short and very durable . 
a truely great item to have when your phone needs protection . 
i love oxo products and this is another great one . 
it is perfect for storing herbal or other iced teas ,  juice etc . 
i use it at the gym and working outside in the yard . 
very happy that i switched and purchased this product . 
great and amazon had the best price bar none . 
they are a good filter and works just as they say . 
i love these and they are the perfect size for what i need . 
but let s be straight :  sound quality is generally pretty bad . 
very nice color still use it great price . 
it is easy to clean and i would highly recommend this . 
i liked that this was a combo for the right price . 
i love the fryer ,  got it way earlier than anticipated . 
like ,  suddenly it won t accept a charge at all anymore . 
consider your climate to make adjustments to ingredients . 
i hand wash mine and its holding up fine . 
for $ the screen resolution is better than expected . 
num_extend liters  and is always running low on me . 
i am not using the cutting board as advertised . 
also great for cooking a pot of beans with ham hocks . 
this is probably the most effective vacuum machine in its class . 
no more worry about getting the layers out of the pan . 
these sound great ,  very good sound clarity and low end . 
it s very handy and doesn t take up much room . 
for me ,  that alone is worth the price . 
they work well if you have a small kitchen for cooling baked goods . 
she is still using it and loves it . 
i look forward to getting the pasta maker attachment . 
these baking cups come in so many cute colors and patterns . 
in my opinion these shower curtain rings deserve the highest rating . 
programming for delayed brew time is a snap with the lcd digital clock . 
the battery can last for num_num or num_num hours straight . 
great product fast shipping !  !  i purchased this for my dad . 
this is a great juicer for citrus fruit . 
glass is so much better than plastic to keep milk cold . 
it is also easy to maintain and clean . 
that s a bit of a downer if you are right handed . 
just as my measuring spoons get lost ,  so do my measuring cups . 
i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who loves cooking . 
i just pray that it will work perfectly in nigeria . 
we have tried other methods ,  but none match up . 
i did not buy mine through amazon ,  but at another store . 
it looks great hung on the backside of my bathroom doors . 
the machine is powerful and very attractive setting on my counter . 
it does not  clip  to the pan as stated in the product description . 
it does seem to pop as well as the old one so far . 
the pitcher has a filter right ?  so why fight it . 
the carafe always sits perfectly in the housing and hot plate . 
i did some searching and decided to go with this case . 
so seems the case is made from silicone and its firmly strong . 
i installed them on either side of my stove . 
although amazon description says high grade german steel it is not . 
but then bread would not rice as good because flour was too cold . 
i use it with a little oil and popcorn salt . 
it s the perfect weight and looks sharp too . 
we ditched the board but kept the knife . 
i have absolutely no complaints about this product . 
its a pleasure to use ,  a solid unit but not bulky . 
i received it in the mail yesterday and make a chocolate shake today . 
overall a good cover at a reasonable price . 
then you can get the water level exactly where you want it . 
a great product that fits snug in my ear . 
it charges my droid ,  blackberry torch ,  and htc phones flawlessly . 
i can stream music to it ,  but not phone calls . 
the cover is great for storage . we definitely recommend . 
no cracks ,  chips or anything else but stone . 
all cars should come standard with this blue tooth . 
i got this one quickly from the supplier . 
they work perfectly with my older vacu vin wine saver . 
bought num_num but i just use one so far . 
this pan set was perfect ,  and surprisingly great quality . 
my boyfriend loves making jerky and always needed extra trays . 
in fact i think it makes the phone feel better . 
i will order another for my other bathroom . 
i like to bake and always use my mixer . 
the lid with the hole is perfect for pouring pancake batter . 
these spoonrests are quite nice for the price . 
don t know why people have problems with it . 
i used to have a mirro ,  but this is better . 
i have been wanting to purchase one of these for a while now . 
baked potatoes requires me to leave it on num_num for some reason . 
no wonder you can t compete with the rest of carrier . 
to say we have pet hair and dander would be an understatement . 
i used these for listening to sports and talk radio . 
two rollers allow you to roll it right in the pizze pan . 
realized i was short on wineglasses for thanksgiving . 
i have tried other roller rings and they were awful . 
refuse to pay more for the lid than i did for the skillet . 
lightweight and stand up in my drying rack . 
i used to use foil to wrap edges . 
i can definitely feel it in my pocket now . 
these are not thick and bulky ,  but also not flimsy . 
you can can with an eight quart presto !  . 
i recommend this product ,  great quality for a good price . 
not sure why that would have any effect . 
this is the brown foam that appears when you add the water . 
you can carry it in your pocket or clip it on your clothes . 
i would love it if it were the defense one !  . 
i would also greatly welcome a glass version . 
the camera however changes color when i takes pictures . 
easy to put on your phone ,  and fits perfectly . 
recommend to any beginning cook who doesn t want to spend too much . 
that did not discourage me from giving this grinder num_num stars ,  though . 
keeps hot items hot ,  cold items cold just as it claims . 
would be useful for cooking on wood burning stoves as well as campfires . 
the amoled screen is also much better and i love it . 
we both have iphones that and we like to keep them charged . 
works great ,  but a bit larger for egg muffin sandwiches . 
the shape is the perfect size for sugar and sugar substitute packets . 
if possible i would rate it a num_extend
they fit perfectly in my breville smart oven . 
the silver piece fell off the first hour i had it . 
it does what the pros say it does . 
this opener is really easy to use and it works very well . 
this is an amazon verified purchase ,  but made by my sister . 
i bought this device because of the reviews i read online . 
i tried a couple of more times ,  with the same result . 
still looks as new as the day i bought it . 
any women or man would love to cook with this skillet . 
love love love them !  they are very high quality materials . 
like oatmeal in the morning ?  this makes perfect rolled or irish oats . 
it s easy to snap on and off when needed . 
it gets four stars for its price range . 
such a great little tool for the kitchen . 
i needed an electric kettle but didn t want to spend much . 
plus it is a lot for the price . 
they work well to protect the screen from scratches . 
they are a great deal for the price . 
every time i clean our machine ,  this drives me a little crazy . 
don t rely on the picture to guess how big it is though . 
this is the third case i have purchased for my wife s iphone num_extend
i got the body glove for my lg touch this afternoon . 
every day i averaged about num_num hours of music and constant texting . 
this company alwalys send out good phone cases . 
not to mention it looks great on my counter . 
if only manufacturers would return to making quality products . 
does the job of keeping it new looking . 
five stars because for what it is ,  it is excellent . 
the price was way out of my range . 
great quality in the product and not cheap like others . 
so amazon s filter package is economical and useful for my needs . 
i use my wide mouth canning jars for just about anything . 
i didn t need anything except a rubber mallet to put this together . 
that means i m using this pan almost every night . 
heat up superb and taste of food is awesome . 
the one i applied when i wrote this review is still very nice . 
all in all for the price ,  it s a handy gadget . 
but this  once i got it right  was very good . 
i did a lot of research before selecting this one . 
i have all hardwoods with one area rug . 
i had been using the white  ipod  ones . 
it take a long time and it s painful for me . 
i bought this to use with a samsung galaxy num_extend skyrocket . 
it also comes with a gold tone filter so no more paper ones . 
we have been using a champion juicer for several years now . 
this is quite a bit heavier than i expected  good  . 
nice to use when making fondant for cakes on granite counter tops . 
i will definitely recommend this product to anyone s use . 
good sound .  .  . controls a little cumbersome ,  but very satisfied . 
the designs come out really clear on the shortbread . 
it small size can fit pretty much anywhere . 
it s solid ,  works ,  fits on the nexus num_extend
if you have fiesta dishes ,  this matching gravy boat is great . 
in such situations ,  a pair of pliers is handy . 
the earbuds start to become uncomfortable after a while . 
i don t remove the carafe from the holder . 
just as i would expect from brita ,  a great product . 
much sturdier build than i was led to believe . 
the light is just right ,  not too bright . 
it isn t really that sturdy but i love it anyway . 
i noticed the lid was quality and tight . 
other than that it s a perfect cutting board . 
actual owners hardly have anything negative to say . 
still have it in num_num and still works like a charm !  . 
i always let them cool down before i refrigerate food in them . 
however ,  the low end models i used to own were always disappointing . 
it has to be charged out of the box . 
why pay $ for these in the store ?  gotta love amazon . 
it s made in a first place for a forlife large round teapot . 
so ,  we can cook tasty food fast ,  and enjoy cooking outdoors . 
we ran out of propane recently when i had it all set up . 
it has turned dark ,  so i know it is doing its job . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
both have flatter carpets and this does a great job with surface dirt . 
it seems cool enough that hemingway might use it . 
purchased for my wife and it seems to work well . 
you get a couple of each size you need . 
quality seems to be the uck of the draw . 
the pan itself is indistinguishable ,  with the same handle design and logo . 
i ve owned mine for over num_num years now . 
fill the basin again completely ,  then pour it out . 
not to say that the capresso ultima is cheap ,  its not . 
battery life is excellent and it charges fast . 
i have it for so many years i can t remember . 
eventually you will and you ll be glad you had it on hand . 
for those of you who have corelle you know . 
we had fried some spring rolls in num_num cups of oil . 
you can also transfer your pod casts too . 
very easy to assemble and take care of . 
never once during the day when i was using it or needed it . 
it is also easy to pair with my ipad . 
just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it . 
lastly ,  very easly to clean  i should say rinse  . 
it s a simple solution for using butter on soft breads . 
well weighted with rubberized bottom keeps it from bouncing around num_extend
i didn t remember if it is in the instructions . 
probably the sturdiest measuring cups i ve ever owned . 
i leave the battery on all the time . 
i used it for mashed potatoes for christmas dinner . 
sometimes the more expensive one is not always the best option . 
handles have a good grip ,  not hard on the hands . 
amazon had the best price and free shipping . 
to me this almost feels a bit like the defender around the edge . 
then i got the zojirushi and it was love at first cup . 
i usually grind for press or chemex but drip works very well also . 
but otherwise works like a charm ,  charges fast . 
it has several ways to scribe and it is accurate . 
i like everything about this set except the size of the frying pans . 
i was surprised how sturdy this strainer is made . 
apps are slow ,  touch experience is just okay ,  app selection sucks . 
the handles are also ergonomic and great for arthritis suffers like myself . 
i use this steamer to steam vegies specially brocolli and freshly caught fish . 
helped with the fit for my ear and they were very comfortable . 
buy a few ounces of coffee and grind it . 
got it to charge my motorola x cell phone . 
it makes switching between tips so much easier !  !  . 
get one of these if you want to connect a usb memory stick . 
if your microwave is smaller ,  it will take more time . 
for home use ,  i would recommend a larger pitcher . 
these are the correct replacement for my panasonic vacuum and are working perfectly . 
my old plan was to write down when i took the pill . 
the oem of num_extend for my htc evo these are lasting longer . 
it was easy to install and the price was certainly right !  . 
the motorola is a micro usb rapid charger . 
edges do not interfere with using the touchscreen . 
basically ,  this is the cadillac of muffin pans . 
i bought this one after doing a little research and reading reviews . 
my only reservation about this item is long term reliability . 
some have good command of english and some ,  not so . 
i ve been using these a month and have been really pleased . 
hope it holds up to wear and tear over time . 
the booklet was a little hard to grasp first time through . 
this has become important because i now have so many chargers !  . 
much earlier than amazon had tracked the package to arrive . 
would definitely recommend it to those who want hot tea on the go . 
this knife is sharper than the old knife ever was brand new . 
finally ,  i purchased this mixer after years of wanting one . 
the trick is to have the dough the proper consistency . 
sharp but construction of the blades may wear or bend in time perhaps . 
this is an excellent product for shower rods of any kind . 
i bought a few of these for our shower . 
these cups look really nice and have a good heavy feel to them . 
the item came exactly the day as promised . 
i recently purchased this for my new home in va . 
the carafe keeps my coffee hot for hours with no thermal plate . 
it is so popular his friends beg him to use it . 
i use it all the time with my samsung galaxy tab num_extend
this handles crumbs drips and splatters very well . 
it worked surprisingly well considering how big cherry pits are . 
keeps it from breaking because i drop my phone all the time . 
so ,  it takes up a bit of fridge space . 
they are satisfying tools to use in the kitchen . 
or the num_extend depending on who you ask . 
simply a great product !  another winner from oxo !  . 
it has held up just fine for going through that kind of usage . 
in my experience ,  wind machines are the best fans out there . 
a perfect gift to go with the mixer . 
i love how they wrap around my small ears . 
with keyboard attached ,  the itorch wasn t able to charge my tablet . 
whoever said it leaks ,  well it does not leak . 
we can have several open at a time . 
this cookie scoop from oxo has improved my cookies markedly . 
this is an essential storage set for anyone . 
one warped ,  the other cracked  both in the microwave  . 
all parts go right into the dishwasher ,  and come out squeaky clean . 
this is a bit annoying ,  but they go off quickly . 
cute cute cute !  it was everything i expected . 
the coffee stays warm so long as you leave it plugged in . 
i m pretty sure i will be buying plenty more . 
the skin covers only the front ,  which is what i wanted . 
very stylish ,  i have received compliments on the phone case . 
but once you get one that fits ,  it s great . 
overall this is a nice phone but not worth anymore than $
the headphones isolate enough external noise to let me enjoy my music . 
it worked well and holds a charge as it should . 
exactly what i wanted for a great price . 
my favorite thing to cook in it is carrots and potatoes . 
no complaints here ,  at least this one won t chip . 
it makes a great cup of coffee though . 
there s a small beep to know the sync is complete . 
the pricewas right and so far the pans look just like new . 
it was perfect for what she needed it for . 
it works a lot like a safety type can opener . 
i figured this to be true of this product as well . 
i recommend it to anybody thats is looking for a bluetooth . 
we have used this spatula almost daily for the past num_num years . 
i wouldn t waste my money replacing the foam filter . 
my other one had a very uncomfortable grip . 
will be ordering a larger one as soon as finances permit another purchase . 
i sharpened all my knives and they have remained sharp for months now . 
you sure will be happy if you get these . 
overall ,  this is a good spare battery for my samsung galaxy num_extend
i have had a progressive international apple peeler and corer for num_num years . 
i have not had any problems with the bluetooth connection dropping off . 
very nice ,  very handy to use most cans everyday . 
they are very soft and easy to wear for long periods of time . 
coli bacteria that is present on nearly every cut of meat . 
if anyone has any suggestions for improving the shots ,  i m open . 
the lamb stew and lasagna are heat and eat . 
i will admit i rarely use the adjustments on the earphones themselves . 
so save yourself $ and get a hooverwindtunnel . 
it is pretty heavy which you would expect of cast iron . 
the case is very sturdy and my iphone is protected from damage . 
holds heat evenly and cooks crust well !  glad i bought it . 
i commend them for standing behind the products they sell . 
 :  i bought a plantronic num_num for my stereo . 
i ve yet to find a can that it can t handle . 
it heats up just fine and operates just fine; no leakage . 
i have otterbox for other items and loved them . 
i would not use my phone without one . 
she took wilton course of cake decoration and found it very useful . 
less surface area means less chance to slop over when stirring . 
it s a shame they won t make covers for nexus num_extend
in terms of space no more than num_extend
it is a rubberized texture which makes the phone easier to hold . 
i like the fact that it is much quieter than the blade grinder . 
it also has a few chips off the rim . 
easy to cut and design held up well . 
i ll probably never go back to commercially ground coffee again !  . 
nice quality charger that has an extra usb port to charge another device . 
to use the led laser pointer you double tap the function button . 
nope ,  it was pretty much animal fat in her iron . 
i highly suggest that you purchase one for your bakers collection ,  . 
it exceeded my expectations by a wide margin . 
the num_num piece set has everything i need . 
these are absolutely wonderful and i would recommend them to anyone . 
they look great ,  and so far they work great . 
i like to listen to music in a dimly lit room . 
this product looks like and works as advertised . 
the ateco rings cut perfectly ,  and made my process easy and smooth . 
it works even without the steamer basket or the small round steamer insert . 
cupcakes or corn bread comes out great every time . 
i still remember us kids working with my mother s can opener . 
especially right after a nasty spill or accident by your kids . 
it does what i want it to do . 
i went to a friends home and he had one . 
the hd  stereo  audio sounds vastly better than the old standard  mono  . 
low cost ,  great construction and helpful in the kitchen when baking . 
fast num_extend internet ,  amazing screen ,  fantastic audio and i mean that . 
this popcon machine uses hot air ,  so no need for oil . 
update :  my roomba died and it was past the one year warranty . 
remember ,  there is a lot of thermal mass here . 
cuts the chees without it all getting stuck on the knife . 
an terrific pan ,  which is used almost daily . 
i bought this amzer case as a holdover  i . e . 
it is large ,  so works best for families . 
had no problem installing the card in my phone . 
easy drop on charging works perfectly with our two nexus num_num phones . 
this is my biggest complaint although still worth num_extend
i m used to lighter weight items so that was an adjustment . 
i d like to think this product protected my phone !  . 
i can go a whole day without charging it up . 
which makes it blend in a fraction of the time of others . 
i ve been using this for over two years now . 
i got my stemware today and i think they are beautiful . 
very easy to clean ,  good price and well worth the money . 
now all of our models are at least four years old . 
when just charging on a normal day it does so pretty quick . 
if you want stronger you ll have to get something metal or wood . 
another geez ,  that s a real num_num second problem to solve . 
great idea and better than any others i ve tried . 
i have never had a problem and i mean never . 
i like it because it s cute and it does protect your phone . 
this is the garlic best press i ve ever used . 
this is the simplest and best tasting coffee maker i ve ever used . 
i will not miss the added expense of bags . 
this is a great little holder for my droid incredible . 
am very pleased and would recommend kitchenaid utensils to anyone . 
this is a must have tool for kitchen use . 
treat it right and it won t crack or break . 
as soon as i received it  ,  my intention was to return it . 
i got one of these in a local store over num_num years ago . 
it is a very high quality ,  solid product . 
i have to admit to a serious bias; i love kitchen aid products . 
it would also be good with facetime with the iphone num_extend
it s barely larger than a normal dinner plate . 
disposing the bag keeps all the dirt together . 
this was an extra cable i bought for multiple room use . 
also the case feels good in the hand and is relatively slim . 
been having open fires in our fire pit in our backyard woods . 
great way to keep butter on your counter . 
the roadster also knew when to turn itself on which was nice . 
this thing is simple to use and makes wonderful espresso . 
this is one of the best cases for my iphone num_extend
case fits perfectly and does not interfere with buttons or screen protector . 
it works like advertised ,  it arrived fast and was in new condition . 
we needed to replace our metrokane corkscrew that cost in the $
this is easy and i can do several at once . 
an oem charger at this price ?  that s gotta be five stars . 
i don t know why i didn t purchase this sooner . 
earbuds that wouldn t fall out of my num_extend
i love seeing my spices ,  i love how simple the design is . 
now i know to wait for it to respond a few more seconds . 
will make the same purchase again when these need replacement . 
it s just what it looks like and very well made . 
i honestly haven t used this in a while . 
it is easy to clean and seems to be very sturdy . 
it performed very well and my rolls were perfect . 
not until i went on amazon did i find what i wanted . 
nothing against it ,  just i didn t really need it . 
i feel this is the best case i have used for a phone . 
this is a nice case ,  fits my phone perfectly . 
it s ideal for families and can be used for generations . 
i made yogurt many years ago and didn t care much for it . 
probably the best  beginner  set i have ever seen . 
i would recommend them and will continue to buy them . 
i would purchase this product again if i need another cable . 
i first saw this similar item on alton brown s show . 
the side with all the little points on it looks defective . 
i bought num_num lbs num_extend ounces of citric acid on line for $
you can read it anywhere ,  see it anywhere . 
i hang in the mid num_extend free range . 
it s as if they are saying  pleeeeaassee buy this service  . 
she has this one and has been very pleased with it . 
i m a baker ,  and that means  compulsive about measuring   . 
it also doesn t fit into my  simply organic  glass jars . 
these work great ,  even cutting things like foil or paper . 
so this crumb tray was a great selling feature . 
you can use it for grain soups ,  porriage ,  oatmeal and more . 
it is nonstick so the product comes out very easily . 
i didn t know it makes the phone thicker . 
speaker is fairly loud and callers sound very good at a reasonable num_extend
no need to grease them as everything just slides off . 
my num_extend and only case for my phone . 
for that fast and hot first cup in the a . m . 
will ship the xia  ,  though bigger cities with the num_extend towers do . 
i love this product !  it s sturdy and holds up well . 
goes on easily but is somewhat difficult to remove . 
i use this constantly for my cast iron skillet and i love it . 
have used this for num_num years and it s still going strong . 
the last pair was the red one which was slightly improved . 
i have several others in different colors and patterns . 
merely wipe the bottom ,  but do not immerse . 
the shun classic knives are some of my favorites . 
this is by far ,  the best case i have ever had . 
the basses are weak and the highs aren t the clearest . 
these spoons have a sturdy construction and useful shape . 
this product allows me to add several inches of water to my bath . 
the mophie juice pack plus is a great addition to my phone . 
so i grade it as a $ speaker . 
it is a simple idea but well excuted . 
doesn t seem to make the screen any harder to read . 
stop being one of those people crowding around an outlet . 
so that s num_extend recharge cycles before the lenmar battery wore out . 
my wife was impressed enough with mine that she wants one by summertime . 
our order arrived on time as anticipated with amazon prime . 
the last time i visited my mother she used this product . 
i use this one almost every day as well . 
for that peace of mind alone i give it num_num stars . 
assemble the mixer with the ingredients and pop it into the freezer . 
tongs are the most useful tool in my kitchen . 
this stockpot is the last one you ll ever buy . 
just let the steaks ,  chops ,  or burgers brown . 
i will watch for any add on pieces . 
my son got one of these for his iphone num_extend and loved it . 
i bought this on a whim ,  but it really works great . 
the dutch oven is the only way to make decent beans . 
in fact ,  i prefer the shorter ,  stumpier fries . 
the leds are a little hard to open ,  but no leak . 
you can t see the clips and they are holding the lights great . 
it s great for chopping nuts and spices without sending things flying . 
and it has capacity for two such devices to be connected . 
they are still sharp after over a year of use . 
care must be taken when cooking over moderately high heat . 
so i doubt this unit is going to sell very much anymore . 
i have a young child who is sloppy at times . 
they are accurate ,  and are very easy to use . 
holds up well and has a good presentation . 
if i ever find it i will be very happy . 
apply the butter and twirl to coat everything . 
but ,  it does what it claims and is worth the buy . 
conveniently ,  when i came home ,  my expensive espresso maker broke . 
these are so handy and helpful with opening jars and containers . 
we travel quite a bit and listen to audiobooks . 
but once you taste how it brews ,  you ll like it . 
it keeps the knife and my fingers in one piece . 
why rival quit making them is beyond me . 
only complaint i have is it s bit too large . 
i seriously use this vacuum all of the time . 
i have two ,  and now am contemplating purchasing two more . 
looks great on the counter ,  takes up less space . 
beyond this ,  i can t see much a difference . 
i got the product fast and it is in perfect condition . 
fits on the sink ,  drains stuff ,  good price . 
it provides excellent protection for my phone and i like the color . 
it held together still after num_num months of use . 
they look very nice sitting on the kitchen table . 
it s a little awkward to poor out of it . 
fits perfectly and is less work than filling up the little included jars . 
there is one downfall to this extended life battery . 
it worked good and now i know my over is right . 
i feel this is the most protective case available . 
this works the same straight out of the shower . 
it is a perfect fit for the droid num_extend num_extend generation . 
it also slices the side of a cheese block perfectly . 
i bought this as a gift for my granddaughter for christmas . 
this grinder makes it so easy to grind whole nutmegs . 
item came super fast and display still running strong almost a year later . 
however ,  everything cooks excellent using the oven degree markings . 
not really that much to rave about ,  it s a funnel . 
backbeat is right; there is some serious bass going on num_extend
had it now for several month ,  still going strong . 
the nokia has very good audio properties ,  and the sounds are crisp . 
in spite of this those are my prefered ones . 
it s a nice quality and i just love the squeeze handle . 
excellent quality and still sharp after two years . 
i only wish they came in an even larger size . 
this is awesome ,  it works great and i use it almost daily . 
i have had several similar units made by another company . 
very good size for making lots of breakfast . 
also this product is well packaged compared to other maps . 
we hand wash according to the manufacturer instead of using the dishwasher . 
buy this product it works well and spreads the marinade evenly . 
it was very well wrapped in bubble wrapping . 
we have used it several times and cleanup is easy . 
it also serves as a good desktop stand when i m home . 
i only tried cheese and chocolate as of today and it was amazing . 
these are easy to clear and work great . 
i bought num_num of them and haven t regretted it . 
very happy that the release is easy but it holds the phone secure . 
it is built very well and looks like it will last several years . 
i think this is much more cost effective than buying bottled water . 
they really try to get things out fast . 
it also has a small footprint ,  and the price is reasonable . 
the suction is great on the carpet as well as the tools . 
if you take care of them ,  they should last . 
it s a heavy son of a gun though . 
sadly ,  the phone crapped out a week later . 
i loved it but after two + years ,  needed to upgrade . 
perfect fit and looks and feels great on the phone . 
product had a $ rebate offer at time of purchase on amazon . 
the vacuum cleaner repair center is an hour from my house . 
i read the reviews carefully before buying this knife . 
it is really helpful in my small kitchen . 
those stupid little cans of sterno don t do it like this does . 
great price compared to the ones in the store . 
there s very little mess and i have my breakfast in no time . 
they are great because they can go right in the oven or microwave . 
it s little ,  it s cheap and it serves it s purpose . 
the purpose of the salt is to stop mold in the summer months . 
i do have a problem with the design . 
it work good and all i tried is only making good sandwiches . 
i ve found that it works best with hot milk . 
easy to clean ,  easy to add and remove ,  etc . 
it will keep it from rusting and allow for years of use . 
and the three sparkers on the device are pretty nice for their size . 
i used the larger one to make biscuits . 
be aware that it is much smaller than your customary num_num inch pan . 
the front one scratched up and didn t last very long . 
then flip into the fry pan and flatten the pancakes . 
i been the cook in the house for the last num_num years . 
i would recommend it !  very good price also . 
the canister is on the small side ,  but it does the job . 
nothing a regular mini usb charger couldn t do . 
it offers plenty of protection with a little added bulk . 
i laid out all of the pieces and simply followed the instructions . 
i went through a lot of can openers . 
it is light weight when empty and is great for traveling with . 
it s versatile and works great for my application . 
the laser pointer turms on with the short click . 
i had to return another bluetooth because it only fit the right ear . 
sometimes the road noise is louder than the other person talking . 
it heats up fast and the whistle is not to loud . 
no more giant cooler using electricity and making noise in my home . 
those little microbes put out a lot of num_extend
but she likes it and that s what counts !  . 
repeated the process cooling it down between oilings num_num times . 
a lot of this companies containers crack and will not seal anymore . 
we are extremely happy with this purchase so far . 
this is nice heavy weight and quality pan . 
they are simply cotton seeds which you would not notice in bleached cotton . 
it is so great to be able to find pieces of jewelry easily . 
i find that it keeps the coffee hot without getting that burnt taste . 
currently ,  i don t even have a data plan . 
any carpets with freyed ends has to be picked up off the floor . 
great price for an  extended  battery that fits under the stock cover . 
i love it ,  it keeps all my sponges dry . 
they are also free of pva and phthalates . 
not a contemporary design but a true classic from farberware . 
the blade savers not only save my knifes but my fingers as well . 
we have had no problems with it and it continues to go strong . 
i love this size because it fits in my golf bag without problem . 
i will not go back to a nonstick !  !  !  !  . 
the case looks great on her black iphone . 
this is a great deal and plenty to last for a bit !  . 
everything else is secondary ,  except for battery life . 
other headsets like the sony num_extend handle this with ease . 
after much research i decided on this wmf pressure cooker . 
this temporarily satisfies the craving . for a grilled hot dog . 
with the ipod controls ,  this almost takes the cake for me . 
i am not a frequent user ,  so keep that in mind . 
these look nice and have wonderful silicone handles . 
they look nice and sturdy and well made . 
it seems every other bluetooth headset has some serious drawbacks . 
again ,  i must say i really like that handle . 
this is one of the handiest gadgets for your kitchen toolbox . 
i wash it all down the garbage disposal with out any issues . 
vacuum was easy to put together and rolls great on hard floors . 
it is far advanced then the two year old one i was using . 
he really enjoys the ease with which it pierces and tenderizes the meat . 
what i did find was either pricey ,  questionable quality or both . 
the weight of the cord alone will pull the cable loose . 
they retain heat better than my previous pan . 
so why settle for anything but the best . 
i had num_num out of num_num or so ovens cracked on arrival . 
it does not come preassembled ,  but assembly was easy enough . 
shure had it right and i wish they still made it . 
i purchased this so i don t run out of seltzer . 
heat honey in the microwave and stir into num_extend
looks great on the table and i use it every day . 
this one little item helps simplify slicing butter and bananas . 
we ll have to see ,  after a few cleaning cycles . 
my case was striping and otterbox replaced it for free . 
measure the inside of your drawer to make sure it fits . 
its a good quality and should last many years . 
it is just the right size for a small household . 
i want to add that the iphone is a slick looking product . 
new trent recommends that you use it only with original apple cables . 
all i really need is a new switch . 
if you have cats ,  you might want to buy two . 
attractive and sturdy ,  plus it works very well . 
i payed $ for my pitcher and it arrived in two days . 
i got this num_num years ago for christmas and love it . 
i was looking for a microwave popper to use for my afternoon snack . 
i don t think the pitcher would take a drop very well . 
i ve used them all and find them to work properly . 
coconut oil seems to burn at a lower temp . 
this knife replaced a similar knife in my faberware knife set . 
it really helped in allowing me to charge more than one device . 
i like to keep my food products separatly so these are perfect . 
this is the most secure mount i ve ever used . 
i love this popcorn maker its easy ,  fast and fun . 
have not tried them yet ,  but look and fit well . 
family members love to walk off with them because they are great . 
have used it probably num_num times so far and love it . 
next ,  instructions said to grind a lemon ,  which has cleansing properties . 
they re a sturdy stainless steel ,  with great grips and clear markings . 
we  just num_num of us  consumed all of it that weekend . 
i like the unique shape and good weight to the product . 
anyway for less than three dollars ,  i have a second battery . 
i recently bought a stove top griddle and this set was perfect . 
nice way to store and see all my shoes  !  . 
lodge is ,  in my opinion ,  the best in iron cookware . 
outstanding manual can operner !  works effortlessly for right and left handed person . 
perfect for hanging all those cool utensils i have . 
when you open a jar and you have to pop the seal . 
it actually covered up a scratch that i already had on my phone . 
i use this more for scooping than scraping pastry dough . 
for small batches of food ,  it s a winner . 
i have my bluetooth on all day and night . 
i first saw it on pretty little liars . 
other than that i am really happy with purchase . 
i am very please with it and i would buy it again . 
this is because diabetisweet is rather grainy ,  even moreso than regular sugar . 
then i just put num_num family size tea bags into the pitcher . 
i bought these for drinks and they work perfectly . 
keeps your phone clean and so much better than regular screen protectors . 
thanks for making it convenient for me to order these online !  . 
quite handy for storing detergent ,  bleach ,  and softener . 
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
i liked the very subtly look on the black iphone . 
it s easy to clean ,  sturdy and built to last . 
visible fit and finish are quite nice . these  phones fold for transport . 
i wouldn t hesitate to buy more of these . 
good product ,  works well with both my laptop and iphone . 
my husband uses to make breakfast for us on saturday morning . 
sauces ,  hamburger ,  and all sorts of other things . 
i have had this grinder for coffee before . 
i have three so far and i would recommend these . 
though it s small ,  it s enough for my personal use . 
this battery appears to be completely identical to the stock tb battery . 
the roomba has improved alot in a couple years . 
i have tried others ,  like this oil the best . 
it worked great keeping the flies off the food . 
comes with three of them so they last a long time . 
my only complaint is that the blue led is fairly bright . 
beautifully crafted . an attractive and functional piece of fine machinery . 
this is how i ended up with num_num cases . 
i keep mine in an airtight dark place . 
some complain it being a tad too bulky looking . 
my mom also tried it out and loves it . 
in this one area the plantronics was better . 
i chose this shoes because were more comfortable than kayano . 
it s what caused me to finally toss the thing . 
when the button pops the rice is done . 
i ve made all kinds of things in it ,  plain and fancy . 
anything for extra battery life for all my apps . 
warning however :  when i say sharp ,  i mean sharp . 
the cannister thingy is incredibly easy to empty and replace . 
it is still in good shape and works great . 
nice case ,  but the color faded after a few months . 
the iphone num_extend does not have that num_extend
for humus ,  the blender beats out the food processor . 
very well made and no complaints about the construction . 
i preheat the container with hot water ,  which helps retain heat . 
you have to take it out to use the other inserts . 
giving it num_num stars because it s a good product overall . 
for this case i will give num_num stars . 
fits nicely in my ear and the sound quality is good . 
i wish it did a waffle cut but i can live without that . 
timers are great to train children and adults to manage their time better . 
best ever !  will cut through the super frozen homemade ice cream . 
good price point and excellent quality ,  i recommend . 
i will definitely be buying this again when we run out . 
will buy more of these when needed for sure . 
this is the knife that took me from a beginner to a pro . 
when reheating anything with sauce you get splatters . 
for my taste in sound ,  they are great . 
the delivery was more rapid than i had expected ,  which was nice . 
a regular cookie sheet worked much better for those cookies . 
my friends enjoy these glasses straight from the freezer . 
the ear piece that goes in the ear it to die for . 
but i stick with what works for me . 
plus the num_num is num_extend more than the pro . 
oh ,  and he mentioned two of his buddies are coming with him . 
in my experience it s hard to find well designed kitchen spatulas . 
all in all ,  i m extremely happy with this grinder . 
perfect fit if you have the same combination of iphone and lifeproof case . 
over the years the inside has become mostly brown . 
i read a review in which someone reported the bottom has deformed . 
fit in the fridge door like a charm . 
you can put different size hoses on this adapter . is strongly made . 
google needs to develop something like itunes asap . 
bought two of these sets and it works perfectly . 
this blender has a membrane type keypad so it s just  wipe clean  . 
wash any items that s u eat out of or with . 
i ve had this case for about a year and a half now . 
this is the best product for brewing iced tea . 
popcorn is my favorite snack and i ve always cooked my own . 
and it works with my other brands of cast iron as well . 
should have known .  .  . you get what you pay for . 
other than that ,  i m thinking of buying it again . 
i feel much more safe with the glove on my holding hand . 
ours pulls a very good vacuum ,  and is easy to work with . 
i like this way better than my electric can opener . 
i have a cuisinart popcorn machine that is pretty pointless . 
i have never had a more reliable can opener in my life . 
i ended up using the medium size set . 
ditto the included plastic box ,  which is very shallow and holds little . 
 i do wish they lasted a little longer . 
i m mostly pleased and will keep using it . 
the storage box is a bonus at a good price . 
this is exactly what i needed for my older phone . 
very substantial and we have cured it for num_num days . 
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah . 
i use this monster to whip cream and whip egg whites . 
the appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath . 
i ve applied four protectors on three phones over the years . 
the classic set feels great and well balanced in your hand . 
bagless so you just dump the junk into the trash and continue . 
i am very happy to have found it !  . 
well ,  it s a necessity if you want uniform baked cookies . 
my old case was super soft and gel like . 
with more experience ,  i can probably control that better . 
i m going to be buying all the other sizes . 
i have no complaints at all ,  it works great . 
it fits my phone perfectly ,  not loose at all . 
this pan is very well seasoned upon arrival . 
they fit perfectly and do a good job . 
i was truly impressed with the simplicity and ease of application . 
i replaced it with a nice ballistics case . 
has saved wines for up to ten days  so far  . 
so i have an insane amount of earrings . 
my htc hero kept dying so i got two of these . 
when you add the shipping ,  its no better than retail . 
it works very well because it scrapes the bottom of the cup completely . 
these are cheap and stand up well as the others . 
i used a bluetooth headset in the past . 
there s a little ramp that helps guide the phone into place . 
i have also stored items to take on vacation ,  hospital etc . 
i only discovered the button functionality by accident . 
i like the ability to be able to buy new blades for it . 
as i suspected my homemade yogurt ran through it . 
i agree with the positive reviews for this product . 
i used this a few times and find it does everything it should . 
when i had my num_extend this was my favorite case . 
good performing ,  very easy to use thermal carafe coffeemaker . 
you can t really turn it off once its started . 
this is a great item to add to the kitchen . 
in retrospect i wish i would have got the one with extra attachments . 
very sturdy and do not get hung up on the rod . 
will recommend this to anyone that needs a reliable back up charger . 
if your looking for a canner ,  this is it !  . 
the design of this juicer is pure excellence . 
it ended up holding probably % more pieces than my old rubbermaid organizer . 
it s cheap and you can make it all different ways . 
the charger allows me to keep my ipod charged while on the go . 
anyhow ,  i kept the mold cups  best way for perfectly shaved ice  . 
i love how you can see the metal of the phone . 
it just whirls the coconut into a butter . 
it holds a goodly amount and seems well made . 
their appearance is pretty much exactly as shown in the picture . 
we bought tjis as an extra charger for work . 
the pink isn t too pink but it s still bright . 
wonderful tool for a beginner or seasoned chef . 
storage in the refrig works out great because of their sizes and shapes . 
the sizes are perfect for many different uses . 
very cute little pitcher that i really like . 
and this is as perfect at the old one . 
i love this set beyond reason for that purpose . 
my husband just got an iphone and this was his first otterbox . 
the toughest material in my wardrobe for sure . 
the case just has a scratch on it now . 
this works great for what i need it for . 
this pan is deeper than it looks and is wide without being unwieldy . 
i love to eat large dinner salads at least three times a week . 
this coffe maker is great after a month of regular use . 
he loved the size and it is so very good at the job . 
this was my first hand blender and i ve been very pleased . 
just wanted to make sure it s still intact inside my oven . 
that would even help the packing process ,  i think !  . 
works perfectly ,  i use it everyday and no problems so far . 
it sounds decent ,  like you d expect from a telephone receiver . 
i also use it for instant oatmeal and any other water based foods . 
this makes one handed tossing and flipping difficult . 
they are fabric ,  and they are pretty thin . 
it appears to be  slightly  smaller  smidgen  than the bowl . 
these knives are easy to maintain and sharpen when necessary . 
this is a good alternative but has its drawbacks . 
she went to a local store and purchased this same item . 
for some ,  the extra second or two is not acceptable . 
otherwise the filter will break or fall right through . 
i use it all the time to charge my devises away from home . 
definitely worth the money including the $ for shipping . 
the one drawback is that it is made in communist china . 
this is as good as you are going to get for drip coffee . 
i purchased the num_num piece fiesta dinnerware service for four in  sunflower  yellow . 
we already had a blade safe for a num_num inch santoku blade . 
i put clear nail polish on theback to hold them in place . 
it still isn t perfect ,  as i have discovered . 
i ran across this in a retail store . 
now i can actually go through a whole day without charging it !  . 
i ll probably add some stained glass panels myself . 
this saucier is great for cooking in huge volumes . 
it is something that everybody should have one . 
and i love the modern look of it . 
i gave it a tiny nudge again ,  almost imperceptibly . 
after about a month ,  i realized that it was yahoo mail . 
we have enjoyed the versitality of this quesadilla maker . 
i got this as a christmas gift for my son in law . 
its like the cats know it cleans them of dander . 
that s a nice touch even though i prefer just using it closed . 
it seems simple enough ,  but nothing else like this is available . 
it was so easy to get moldy and discolored . 
i use this with my nokia lumia num_num and love this . 
my phone literally bounced on each side and landed on its face . 
these bags fit well ,  and no issues installing them . 
i ve tried cheap ,  crappy tamale pots ,  and various makeshift options . 
locking tab in the hinge to keep them folded up for storage . 
the plastic container has a bit larger capacity ,  which is nice . 
it s great for storing homemade pizza dough overnight in the fridge . 
and that is what happened to my set . 
i love this thing !  i used to have one years ago . 
i haven t tried using it over my car stereo yet . 
i got it when i given my krups coffee maker . 
no need to peel the garlic if you don t want to . 
even with the anna update ,  symbian is a mess . 
those grilled eggplant slices make fabulous vegetarian lasagna or mousakka . 
amazing !  !  !  folks ,  this is how products should be built . 
it heats fast and stays hot ,  so it cooks fast and even . 
i m still giving it num_num stars though ,  num_extend
if i need more ,  this is where i m coming . 
i finally asked for some cast iron skillets to replace them . 
it does a very good job on all types of meats . 
i would compare this to a trojan condum . 
once it is done ,  water is added to the  max ice  marking . 
i fond them more comfortable and easier to adjust . 
it is good to know that it does not break . 
and they don t take up any room in the freezer . 
i will definitely do business with them again !  . 
once i used it ,  my worries went away . 
perfect for quick fact checking but not leisurely browsing . 
charged phone for num_num hours and battery only inprove from num_num to num_num %
this case is offers great protection and style for a decent price . 
you can buy commercial products made for that purpose . 
i had to go to the company s web site to get it . 
otherwise ,  a good product; it is made well and attractive . 
they show hardly any wear or chance of failing . 
kitchenaid no longer sells parts for this model . 
i don t stack them to prevent chips on the glass edges . 
all the buttons fit perfectly through the openings . 
the only thing is you can t make a big amount . 
gave it as a gift with the matching cups . 
it s pretty sturdy and heavy  like it should be  . 
i had to bend them back a couple of times . 
conical burr grinder that is all that i needed . 
i think it will last a long time . 
it makes me smile ,  just seeing it in use . 
the vacuum is the size and weight of a manual floor push vacuum . 
i love that the colors dont die down when baked . 
great weight and quality ,  bake perfectly and easy to clean . 
this is the best protective case for your ipod . 
a larger pot would end up with wasted leftovers . 
i had to have one for my galaxy . 
she is very pleased with it and uses it often . 
so i sold the keurig and bought this instead . 
it ships rasor sharp and the fibrox handle feels great . 
also ,  in addition to style ,  we were hoping for more durability . 
that comes in handy in a noisy space . 
purchases for my son to use in his car . 
i always use the great little recipe that comes with it . 
i recommend this item to anyone looking for great value . 
i give the product a++++ ,  you won t regret . 
be careful not to burn the popcorn and discolor your popper . 
i just bought the nordic popover pans and they are great too . 
i bought three cases at the same time . 
however it will not work with the zoom attachment lens i got . 
so guess which one i use ? there was a dr . 
this is only one of my moments where i needed it . 
purchased this battery to extend the life of a phone . 
it fits nice and snug on my wide ironing board . 
it s stood up to heavy use and abuse like a champ . 
the inside is slightly rough ,  which gives a good grind . 
i have not experienced this issue and pictures turn out just great . 
i went out and bought this specifically for the task . 
an instant aerosol sprayer with just a few pumps . 
it penetrates ,  is not sticky and brings out the wood grain nicely . 
will give them to someone else to use . 
i replaced a smaller block with this one and love it . 
however this one from amazonbasics is really good . 
don t like the taste of the steel carafe . 
most cast iron will need reseasoning from time to time . 
the voice dialing is also very useful ,  precise and responsive . 
i love it and i am so glad i tried it . 
one of the smaller cutters has a dent in the edge for cutting . 
there are two negative points about this num_extend
i read a lot of reviews and decided to try this . 
cuts butter fresh from the refrigerator with no extra effort . 
i bought this after reading all the reviews . 
i don t understand other reviewers comments with bag fit . 
for the price this can opener fits the bill . 
doesn t radiate heat as much like your oven would . 
made of quality stainless steel this is a keeper . 
if a call comes in ,  the headset connects right away without complaints . 
with every day use ,  it is my favorite coffee maker thus far . 
they should make one of these in a nice wood . 
this baby powers through any kind of cheese you can throw at it . 
also like that case has belt loops in addition to belt clip . 
these all fit snugly together and clean up was super easy . 
i love not having to take my purse in everywhere i go . 
good range ,  good sound and a solid device . 
the stemless look seems to be what s  in  these days . 
and i never liked how little they held . 
i picked this spool up for the garden rather than trussing turkeys . 
i can charge my phone twice maybe even three times from almost dead . 
from eggs to fried chicken to alfredo sauce to grilled cheese sandwiches . 
i use the thinker bacon and it is perfect . 
i wanted an easy to clean jar to store milk in . 
pretty simple case and that was all i wanted . 
i found that be more or less accurate . 
add a bit of milk ,  or blend the eggs a lot  . 
i grate everything from cheese to carrots to nutmeg with it . 
my back hurts too much to even think about eating . 
it sure did make my life easier over the years . 
however ,  i paid mors for this one than i really wanted to . 
the one on the counter looks really cute and saves space . 
i owned earlier versions of plantronics ,  jawbone and motorola . 
overall i am very happy with the purchase !  . 
i have long known that oxo good grips makes the best product . 
this is a great size for smaller or larger families . 
no complaints for the price its a great buy . 
i hate hate hate most toasters on the market . 
this item is simple ,  appears well made and is attractive . 
i will continue using this one when i have more coffee to bring . 
the foodsaver containers will keep it green and fresh for days and days . 
we eat a lot of asian fare ,  so these are perfect . 
i use them daily now and use my plastic storage for dry goods . 
the shred attachment that came with it was too thick for parmesan . 
however ,  what i brought for my girl friend is the blueant num_extend
the grind appears even ,  with very little dust . 
at this price the case is a very good value . 
now the battery life is tolerable thanks to this . 
it takes up little space on the counter . 
a delightful story i enjoy reading again and again . 
this is a great gadget if you are looking for portion control . 
after several close % trips i decided an extra backup would be nice . 
the only problem is most cheap chargers and headphones dont fit it . 
hours after filling it the coffee was still hot . 
one just happens to be more polished than the other . 
this mixer is by far the best mixer i have ever owned . 
small basket of crackers and we had lunch . 
the speaker sound quality was good although if too loud sounds muffled . 
in fact ,  i got the shun herb shears num_extend instead . 
i must use this pan at least num_num times a week . 
i purchased a rubbermaid bread container and that works perfect . 
btw ,  you can also hang this on the wall . 
the one special feature i love is the cleaning cycle . 
mine were done in less than num_num minutes . 
couldn t have been any better for my motorola . 
it was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger . 
got it as a gift and the recipient loves it . 
it charges so fast  !  !  !  i love it . 
very comfortable in your hands and absolutely never slips out of ones grip . 
perfect fit for microwaving those num_num ounce cans of progresso soup . 
i bought these as a gift at christmas time . 
i still use them often every time i work out . 
it s speed out performs electic kettles and the microwave . 
if sprint had offered it ,  i would have gotten it hands down . 
he s used the charger twice now and it works as described . 
i added about num_num tablespoons oil to a quantity of about half full . 
i gave num_num stars because i got exactly what i expected to get . 
it washes well and is an invaluable kitchen tool . 
i really thought it would not be as good as it is . 
this is a nice size grill and it works fine . 
i find this diamond stone to be very versatile . 
i thought this particular screen protector was a little difficult to get on . 
purchased the oxo lemon zester and like other oxo products ,  very good . 
alsgreat for keeping your holiday gravy from lumping . 
then i used the flat attachment that snaps on the vacuum . 
i have had my dinc for num_num months now . 
for the $ it s a great product ,  but with limitations . 
i have been using plantronics for about num_num years . 
i will update comment again if i find otherwise . 
it comes with all you need to install it nicely . 
i dont think it affects the camera like other people have said . 
i ordered this for my son who has allergies . 
amazingly light ,  very intuitive ,  great audio ,  and just looks great . 
it s easy to use ,  easy to set up ,  and works . 
i hope you enjoy this product as much as i do !  !  . 
i decided to try this one since oxo has never let me down . 
i use this product each and every time i make hamburgers . 
this is the best option for an alternative to a bluetooth earpiece . 
i rarely use more than % of the charge in a typical day . 
it stays on my counter top at all times . 
i ordered the screen protectors for num_num lg optimus v phones . 
nokia web browser is much improved from the num_extend num_extend
found an old sunbeam electric knife with no cord . 
i m not really sure it made much of a difference . 
most hybrids aren t useful ,  not serving either function well . 
however ,  you can use your fingers or box they came in . 
no need to line upopenings to pour coffee . 
but taste isn t as great as spring water though . 
how can you go wrong with a cover that is so expensive . 
it works very well with the size of my phone . 
maybe not every day ,  but several times a week . 
the only con is it s size :  it s huge . 
if you are a gourmet cook ,  this is a must have gadget . 
i have one for coffee and one for loose tea . 
i bought two of these for my kitchen and they are well constructed . 
i did not have an issue with my cake sticking . 
it cleans up easily for pasta just rinse it off . 
i feel that i got great value for the $ spent . 
i ll update this review if this ceases to be the case . 
sturdy and well made ,  hard plastic ,  should last a long time . 
have had it for a few months now and have been very pleased . 
it makes fast work of coring an apple . 
i don t worry about hurting my expensive blades or bag with these . 
you can customize your popcorn by type of oil ,  seasonings ,  etc . 
i think it took me about num_num minutes . 
i have had this case for years and its still working perfectly . 
i like the varying sizes and they are very strong . 
the piece fits very well and the volume is sufficient . 
it is easy to use; and would be difficult to use incorrectly . 
i have never been disappointed with anything they sell . 
the sound is good for such a small product . 
i have the sharpest knives in the neighborhood . 
i certainly recommend it based on my experience to date . 
but for this price why not take the risk ?  !  !  . 
no more scrubbing with bits of food ,  herbs ,  etc . 
it does what it s supposed to do :  hold pots . 
i ve had others in the past which were all unsatisfactory . 
this ironing board makes it so much easier . 
no more scalding yourself trying to dig out your lids . 
i use it for both my kindle and my ipad . 
this makes the pan perfect for sauces and gravies . 
its worth letting someone that knows what they are doing put it on . 
i love how it really protects my iphone and its new . 
coming from a centro ,  i found it a bit large for thumbs . 
not even the tiniest bit of flex in the handle . 
this is a semi heavy spoon and the grip is very nice . 
i definitely highly recommend their products and will continue to buy them . 
the indentations are deep enough that cakes come out looking terrific . 
this is one of those  must have  oxo kitchen tools . 
about one minute with the steel and this knife is ready to go . 
otherwise ,  i d recommend looking at one of those . 
such a little price for so much excellent work it can do !  . 
i wish i bought these a long time ago !  . 
i gave this as a gift to my aunt who loves wine . 
the cheers set by mikasa make great bar and drinking glasses . 
it is exactly as described and works as expected . 
it cracks ,  then just scrape lightly and remove . 
very pleased with the product and recommend the cutters and the seller . 
this hand mixer power is like no others . 
the defender case is good but has faults . 
so many wonderful options to use with such a lovely cake pan . 
if one does not own this ,  it may pose a problem . 
this black and decker num_extend juicer makes those tasks a whole lot easier . 
the misto spray solves this with a fine mist after a few pumps . 
i am extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone . 
i love it and i d buy more in a heart beat . 
they charge as fast as other chargers i own . 
then attach the upper chamber to the pot and turn it on . 
i ve always been in search of a great cup of coffee . 
this seems like a well made and well thought out oven . 
additionally ,  clean up ,  though not too difficult ,  can be messy . 
it works great ,  the cookies don t stick to it . 
i just used the recipes that came with the machine . 
this acase is every bit as protective and fits far better . 
i reviewed the first garlic press that i bought . 
product feels good and has a nice grip . 
i found this online ,  and requested it as a gift . 
amazon had a great price on these around christmas . 
this is a great skin case for the iphone num_extend
i m using it to hold cone coffee filters . 
not big ,  doesn t take much space of the counter . 
i had one years ago ,  but discarded it because it was rusty . 
i have been wanting to purchase one for awhile and finally did it . 
we purchased the hepa filter when we purchased the mighty mite commercial vacuum . 
this is the best coffee maker that i have ever used . 
i ll definitely be adding more to the kitchen cupboards in time . 
it comes out even as does a great job . 
from pasta to seeds or vegetables they work for me . 
the butter flavoring that came with it was so good . 
this does just what it is supposed to . 
one other point to mention ,  the lids are not interchangeable . 
the works for both tall and medium length utensils . 
they are the bare minimum length and therefore barely work . 
the department store pans never produced a pizza of good quality . 
i would buy this case for anyone with an iphone . 
the plastic grip that holds the meat is my only complaint . 
from freezer to oven or microwave and practically indestructible . 
i needed something for my twins to brush their teeth . 
the clip also has a lock to prevent accidental drops . 
each piece is heavy in your hand without being bulky . 
i don t know why this part isn t plastic also . 
after i have enough i will switch it not big deal when its $
i had a good run with it and it held up great . 
i really like the combination of silicone and plastic materials . 
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a razr . 
ive had several of these grinders over the years they all work perfectly . 
this is the one appliance in my kitchen i could not live without . 
another useless keurig button on the fancy models . by the way . 
i recommend spending a little more and getting a larger one . 
they go on easily ,  look great and have no bubbles . 
that prevented them from sinking or going wonky directions . 
i use a baratza burr grinder i bought many years ago . 
excellent quality for the lesser calphalon cookware line . 
if you like to bake ,  this is a must . 
i do not put any of it in the dishwasher . 
and in the industry ,  you find them quite a bit . 
they work very well on my cast iron pans . 
my friends and family also have zojirushi but different models . 
these things are great for making applesauce fruit rollups . 
it came early in the mail ,  the price is just right . 
these were a great price and well worth my time and money !  . 
i have perfect rice ready to go at a moments notice . 
however ,  the end result is well worth the few extra minutes required . 
that was my fault ,  and because its an older model . 
i purchased and assembled two pairs of these stands . 
phone has been dropped so many times and still to this day nothing . 
gets the job done and works for a great price . 
think of it as an  attic fan  in your window . 
i m singel and pratyy much use it as my everyday pan . 
i like that oster has so many replacement parts here on amazon . 
i ve used cast iron pans for over twenty five years . 
we ve used this for several years at this point . 
i love lattes ,  but hate to keep throwing money at starbucks . 
on the second barrel full i squeezed more gently . 
the real drawback though is the handle on the lid . 
i bought num_num in different sizes and plan to buy another one . 
this is a great advantage with this unit . 
can use it for french toast etc as well . 
i love pyrex products ,  and this one does not disappoint . 
i have never used one ,  tried it out and it is wonderful . 
there is no comparison between this and a blade grinder . 
they are kind of large wanted smaller ones . 
would be nice is a splatter screen to be added into the package . 
this scoop has been such a big help in the kitchen . 
the price is also well within range for the average person . 
this is a better size than the normal num_num cup pot . 
i have mixed feelings about this motola mount . 
i extend it only when i have laundry . 
this sharpener is awesome ,  well worth the money . 
do yourself a favor and check them out . 
it is still usable ,  i just wish it didn t curl . 
this pan was excellent quality and i used it right away . 
very smooth ,  fast ,  efficient and connects with exchange like a charm . 
this has truly been a  set and forget  device for me . 
wish it was a little bigger but solid dish . 
i can t believe the quality of the photos taken with this fisheye . 
the first time i used it i burnt some of the corn . 
i don t know how i ever got along without it  !  . 
these rings also do a great job of poaching eggs as well . 
works well been using them for about num_num years now . 
my wife has broken her iphone screen three times . 
it is a valuable piece of cookware to make cooking easier and convenient . 
it works great and gives me consistent results every time . 
this protector goes on easily ,  and can be removed with no problems . 
they get a lot more life than the batteries we replaced . 
when it arrived it was much smaller than i was expecting . 
i bought a black and a pink case . 
the noise seems necessary to support the power . 
i am so glad i did . it works and it works well . 
this earbuds from sony were more comfortable and really satisfied me . 
slicing roast beef :  getting wafer thin slices couldn t be easier . 
i left mine charging over night and it didn t finish . 
but that s just the icing on the cake . 
and that is my biggest complaint ,  is their poor quality of workmanship . 
its zagg ,  one of the better screen protectors out there . 
after using it for a week or so the plastic smell went away . 
it looks like you can just wash it off though . 
a fairly sturdy case great for short term uses . 
pyrex has not done that so i stick with what works . 
my husband likes to take tuna salad sandwiches for his packed lunch . 
they are a little hard to find in the stores . 
customer service from the supplier  dailypconline  was also really good . 
made of tempered glass so no dangerous sharp edges should the glass break . 
i love adding new colors and this blue is just great . 
so while i was reluctant ,  i took a chance and bought the num_extend
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
the stinky smoke smell no longer hovers around my apt . 
i have no complaints whatsoever about the suction . 
i ve never had anyone tell me that they couldn t understand me . 
i realy like this ram universal x grip ,  works great . 
the thirstystone coasters i ordered to go with this fit well . 
it really dresses up my server for special occasions !  . 
easy instalation ,  perfect for hands free use of phone . 
sturdy and better than the original and much less obtrusive . 
out of the way and easy to pack . 
the item was shipped early in great condition . 
i just use the belgian waffle mix by kruteaz . 
we have just started making homemade chocolate candies and these are perfect . 
however ,  it is solidly built and well thought out . 
for some reason i thought these could be used for chips or bags . 
we just wished that it covered the front of the phone . 
pass the knife along the steel from haft to blade tip . 
it does steam meats but i stick to the grill and oven . 
this jug is beautiful !  i love everything about it . 
i m just your average guy who really likes to cook and eat . 
great !  bought as a gift for my grown daughter . 
i don t know why others are having issues . 
they are different ,  recipes may need adjusting ,  etc . 
it was easy to install and looks great on the wall . 
these are great and last a really long time . 
i can t cook popcorn with quality equipment like we now have . 
just be sure the bottom is on tight before that first run . 
after i bought a new one i found it . 
the quality is excellent and i know it will last forever . 
love this protector best thing they came up with . 
i find myself turning it all the way up for virtually every purpose . 
i would buy it again at this price . 
it is easy to hold ,  control and peels very efficiently . 
this one is the best and easy to operate . 
i used alton browns formula for coating pans . 
it is a nice feeling and definitely stiff enough . 
i used to have a complete set of cast iron skillets and pots . 
i ve purchased two of these as spares and both work great . 
i have never had any problems using this pan . 
the cast iron plate really holds the num_extend stars . 
no kids are going to stick around to help you then either !  . 
or whatever else you could possibly want to put in it . 
i still stand behind my purchase and review . 
it sleeps into the vacuum easily and removes easily . 
you can adjust the volume if it is too loud . 
unfortunately ,  it also blocks the cellphone signal a bit . 
there is just more surface area because of the ridges . 
we even refer to it as our  pretty ,  red toaster .   . 
or maybe it doesn t fit quite right and the color is silly . 
i ve read that other people have trouble getting a fine grind . 
my husband uses it everyday and hasn t had a problem . 
so some fitted sheets do not fit on this . 
i have another of their headsets and it performs quite well . 
for a pie with num_num to num_num apples it s wonderful . 
it fits with or without the surface case . 
i am what the world calls a foodie . 
battery slips in very easily . still i would call this num_num stars . 
now the phones can go all day without a charge . 
i love the color; more interesting than plain silver . 
i can charge my galaxy num_extend num_num times and about % on the num_extend
i ve been using these for nearly num_num months now . 
unlike others ,  i haven t had any problems taking it off . 
the only change i would like to see is the connector port . 
i bought it two months ago and regret spending a penny on it . 
can t wait to try a custard based ice cream . 
i only wish that the instructions were much clearer and simpler . 
each layer fits perfectly on top of the other one . 
makes a three shots of great tasting  espresso  . 
a real time saver . i ve found clean up is easy . 
we enjoy our favorite tea leaves more often now . 
i put this into a kitchen base cabinet . 
the cups are sturdy ,  and they have a nice brushed silver finish . 
this num_extend charger will charger even small tablets like the kindle fire . 
amazon replaced them with no questions asked though . 
given that double duty ,  i do question the facility of this product . 
this really whips up nicely and no cracks or crevices stuck with anything . 
btw ,  her caramel popcorn is the best i ve ever had . 
these should fit all of my mixing ,  marinating and food storage needs . 
it was easy to put together and they seem very sturdy . 
water pooled in the scoop but did not rust at all . 
the stylus seems to be good enough quality for the price . 
fab glasses ,  love the look and the feel . 
once the initial cut is started ,  it cuts right through like butter . 
good range of sizes for small to large jobs . 
i got rid of all my plastic containers and upgraded to all glass . 
i haven t had any problem with them tangling . 
no such problem with his phone with this cover . 
it lets you fully charge your phone and then some . 
it took over a month to get with even with my prime membership . 
i m not at all scared to let my num_num yr . 
they do what they are supposed to do . 
the antenna mount is worth the piece by its self . 
if the vacuum is too strong the weight turns hard . 
they always seem to crack shortly after using the product . 
i used this when making blueberry jam and then canning it . 
bought this for my granddaughter as a gift . 
 have lots of bowls handy .  very quick ,  very easy . 
i have no doubt it will do it s job extremely well . 
makes me feel more organized than i really am !  . 
then went to the bagged popcorn for a number of years . 
this sits in my car and goes wherever i go . 
i use it to keep the bathroom counter clear of clutter . 
i don t have a body glove case for my droid charge . 
bought this charger to charge my power gen iphone charger . 
can be used for all sorts of baking . 
very easy to wipe clean ,  wash by hand or in the dishwasher . 
it is also a great price and i would highly recommend this case . 
this meat dial thermometer works like a charm . 
nice set of tools sturdy enough but yet light weight . 
she told me her phone was going dead so she limited her call . 
it holds onto the windshield and doesn t fall . 
however ,  even in its current form ,  the device is quite useful . 
i hope they make this for iphone num_extend as i am upgrading soon . 
it s very quiet and has a few helpful options for each fan . 
it s almost entirely metal construction with extra features that set it apart . 
i have not complaints where this item is concerned . 
this holds the phone in the otter case snuggly . 
i m glad i can find the cartridges here for now . 
the only problem i have found is with the noise cancellation . 
i used the small coffee press at first . 
it was just too bulky and got tired of how bulky it was . 
this has been my favorite bluetooth earpiece since i purchased it . 
i recently decided to try my hand at biscuits . 
i charge the extra one before i go to bed . 
mine came already seasoned ,  so i was happy about that . 
i started out with the holmes version of this . 
they work very well and i was not disappointed . 
very sturdy and looks nice in my kitchen . 
if you make a lot of pies ,  this is for you . 
it looks expensive even though the cost is great . 
this is a forum to review the product . 
very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it . 
going to the dentist or talking to an insurance salesman is more fun . 
the standard price seems to be under num_extend
the other night i came home to the smell of gas . 
well ,  we went from silent to a loud fan noise . 
cleans out the entire bowls so as not to leave any ingredient behind . 
no big deal for me ,  but worth mentioning . 
the water rinse takes care of most of the work . 
i love that this dish has a handle . 
needed it to do a project which worked out well . 
nice you can read digital from across room . 
i m sure all of the other reviewers have covered the same thing . 
this is real cherry wood and not particle board . 
i like it too so i just purchased one for mine . 
the only thing i d want is num_num that is num_num size larger . 
the sound quality is the best i have ever experienced . 
it has worked almost flawlessly and clean up is easy . 
extremely sharp !  probably one of my favorite kitchen items . 
i bought a couple of these for our htc phones . 
so i could have found it when i initially lost it . 
saw this in a store and after a long deliberation ,  bought it . 
i actually bought three cause i figured at least one would crap out . 
but if you re not at that right angle ,  forget about it . 
i ve purchased dozens of grinders in the past . 
i bought two of these to make a layer cake . 
i cleaned the area with alcohol and put it up . 
i love gadgets so it fills my toy chest of cooking tools . 
get it ,  love it ,  and watch your fingers !  . 
if you see a red or yellow light you are not fully charged . 
it made a beautiful loaf ,  like a picture in a cookbook . 
that is num_extend years of technology upgrades and advances !  . 
no holding your mouth just right and using dock extenders . 
the fiesta ware is very strong and doesn t scratch or chip easily . 
picked this up for a num_extend phone and it works wonders . 
i also like that it accommodates books of varying size . 
it is a little hard to get out when full of wet coffee . 
i went to the lodge factory outlet in south pittsburg tn . 
there is another version of the salad shooter ,  but with fewer attachments . 
they gave it high praise so i picked up a few . 
this is the only one you need for most cooking . 
this is the first time i am using a cast iron pan . 
the answer is ,  you buy a rice cooker . 
but this is not really a problem for me . 
i would highly recommend this product to anyone that travels a lot . 
i cannot complain ,  but the charge has gone down somewhat . 
these are clear protectors ,  personally like them better than the glossy ones . 
food does not stick on it at all . 
i was expecting only three pairs ,  so that was a nice surprise . 
very fast . this pot is very sensitive to changes in range temperature . 
the second cup is even hot due to the double insulated walls . 
i estimated that for the price ,  it paid for itself vs . 
you might think it is cheap unless you play around with it . 
now my friends want me to get them one  just like this  . 
it was easy to install ,  is sturdy and easy to use . 
i have a personal phone and a business cell phone . 
they are very strong which really appeals to me . 
i needed this charger for my car ,  it works well for me . 
but if it is for you ,  maybe you should buy another brand . 
this is the best frother i ve ever had . 
but i probably would have bought it anyhow . 
we mostly wash them by hand and put them back in the freezer . 
also ,  i ve had it for num_num years and no problems . 
i use it to pour cereals and grains into glass jars . 
how do you review this obvious utensil ?  it s a splatter screen . 
this was a great purchase and fits the phone perfect . 
this is the best case around for the iphone num_extend
it works like a dream !  i bought one for my sister also . 
use a toaster toaster instead of a toaster oven . 
i ordered two more to have on hand . 
i will not go with out this in my kitchen . 
you can remedy this by angling the headphones closer to your mouth . 
it is sturdy and only has minor  if any  sagging in each section . 
i guess i won t bother to show her my onion goggles . 
it keeps the coffee hot  there is a num_num hour shutoff  . 
this is my second otterbox for my iphone num_extend
you can read instructions on the wet application method elsewhere online . 
after a bit of searching i found waring . 
water all over the stone and instant steam . 
it conducts heat so evenly ,  so the food gets cooked beautifully . 
the case is very stylish ,  and you can choose from many colors . 
it also improves the phone s grip in your hand . 
i love the material its made out of . 
it heats up fast and is very well made . 
it charges when it needs to and works great . 
then i took my first bath with it in place . 
i have iphone num_num which i use a lot in college . 
by the time it is finished the coffee is cold . 
needless to say i love it ,  it has made my life easier . 
protects nicely ,  and buttons are easy to access . 
i ordered this because i wanted a clear protector . 
enough has been said about this product .  .  . almost all positive . 
for the price ,  it s a great little machine . 
these tops fit my old mason jars perfectly . 
i will look for a driver and update this review as appropriate . 
they are the best and always will be for protection and durability . 
i plan on moving first and then filling my cupboards with duralex . 
however ,  the lid is a single  thick  layer of plastic . 
mine came with peppercorns already in the mill . 
i wanted a new case ,  something smaller than the bulky otterbox defender . 
i ended up ordering another one ! and they come in multiple colors . 
i do love the fact that it fits in my new microwave . 
they are lightweight but nevertheless work really well . 
i date not tell him how much cause he would not believe me . 
to be honest i was pleasantly surprised with their customer service . 
the only problem i had was during the shipping process . 
an earlier review suggested there were two filters per box . 
these cords are exactly what i needed to have on hand . 
so if you are tired of replacing pur filter faucet mounts try culligan . 
seidio innocase extended rugged hybrid case and holster solution for htc num_extend evo . 
battery lasts a long time ,  i think longer then my stock battery . 
if you want these in a hurry you will be disappointed . 
it says the num_extend requires a special door ,  that costs $
it can t cover both ends at the same time anyways . 
i admit ,  it is a little tacky ,  but it works great . 
i can open ,  use what i want and reseal it tight . 
they seem to take the more extreme temps i wrongfully work with . 
this pan will require some seasoning which will require some patience and effort . 
brewing with a french press is simple and easy . 
i have to tilt it slightly while the tea steeps . 
seem to work just fine and last as long as the original . 
this is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture . 
so pretty brand new ,  but that won t last . 
it s a great case which protetcs the phone greatly . 
also can be used for cut fruits ,  soup ,  etc . 
this makes for a more discrete appearance when worn . 
either way its great and versatile for many uses in the kitchen . 
the attachments that you can add on are endless !  and very useful . 
she said it is soft ,  smooth ,  comfortable and cool . 
i have only had this for a few weeks . 
purchased in num_num to replace all the plastic storage containers . 
this was a gift requested by college student . 
the size is big enough and not too large . 
my father s favorite is peanut butter and marshmallow fluff . 
but i didn t hurt the rating because of my personal problems . 
i changed careers and now spend a lot of time on my phone . 
ice cold ,  flavored vodka is a nice warmer upper . 
after num_num years ,  the surface had become slightly scratched . 
have used this for hot oil ,  candy making . 
no more waiting for a hot cup of tea . 
i ve had the xlink bluetooth gateway for over a month now . 
i have this bowl and the num_extend size . 
it s by far the best way i ve found to make popcorn . 
when its on the lowest setting you can t even hear it . 
i m thinking of getting her one for mother s day . 
the num_extend product is slightly thinner and shorter than the acase . 
i got this to protect mine and mom s phones !  . 
it seems like a very pure way to make coffee . 
you can even charge the phone by usb while a second battery charges . 
i was very pleased that i bought this item . 
i brought another one in a different color and loved it . 
was not too difficult to put together ,  either . 
blue light comes on when you re using it !  . 
but this happens with most indoor grill pans . 
i have a black phone and my cover came in white . 
i can answer the call just by pressing a button on the headset . 
i close off the bedrooms and have it running in the living room . 
they don t stain like the plastic measuring cups do . 
got this charger to have a spare at work for my krzr . 
hopefully it will last for num_extend years as well . 
i like it as soon as i seen it . 
not a perfect air proof vacuum seal ,  but still good enough . 
you can maneuver it well even if your just starting out in baking . 
i have spent lots and lots of money on knives . 
there are cutouts for each of the controls and the camera lens . 
i really like using this for those special little goodies . 
it is programmable so i avoid constantly entering the time for reoccurring events . 
i m not sure i could ve done the repair without this trick . 
washing your unit immediately after slicing helps with this . 
i only use this grinder for flaxseed and it words very well . 
a good inexpensive cable that works like the original . 
this a great size pan for me and my family . 
also it stores very well ,  alot more efficent than the traditional crockpot . 
will keep them as a place to shop . 
no seperate switches for air cleaning and humidifying . 
overtime ,  i noticed that it wasn t picking up the dirt anymore . 
properly called  fines  ,  it is just the nature of the press method . 
to use such accessories ,  you would need to remove the case entirely . 
this is a great looking case for the price . 
this case has a nice feel to it ,  it doesnt feel cheap . 
i read lots of reviews here on amazon and elsewhere . 
i purchased it through amazon and it s perect for my home office . 
this came highly recommended and now i know why . 
i got this to use in the break room at work . 
this is a sturdy cell phone case for my iphone . 
so far i am still on the first one out of the set . 
so i just pulse when i am chopping and it works great . 
easy to place in and out of a jean pocket . 
they don t heat up much at all in the microwave . 
i treated myself to a new num_num qt . 
or ,  i could dish out a full portion from a casserole . 
we bought this waffle maker because the american ones are hard to find . 
it is glass ,  so you got to be gentle with it . 
the other reviewers are correct when they say these are actually kershaw shears . 
with our white counters where this is placed ,  it s virtually invisable . 
the plastic is sturdy and fit the phone well . 
you can t go wrong with this waffle maker . 
not everything from the night before can just be reheated . 
i have done this for over ten years now . 
this cover is great and stands for itself . 
great great great for keeping an extra battery charged . 
it works for everything i need it to be . 
it is beautiful and very comfortable on my ear . 
it is very sturdy and gets the job done . 
they can be put in microwave which is a plus . 
it does have sharp feet and will potentially scratch pot s interior . 
i did not allow any time for the tub to warm num_extend
it has a very sturdy base and the heavy glass jar i like . 
the rubber cover for the charging and hdmi jack is a little floppy . 
they are also good if you are eating soup or casseroles . 
the only downside are the cheap plastic trim rings between each leg section . 
good weight without being too heavy ,  even ,  quick heating . 
ok ,  i agree ,  thats a pretty lousy idea . 
and this thing holds heat like a beast . 
i may get a smaller one as well . 
i set this on num_num and it comes out perfect . 
i use them while jogging and got plenty of sweat on them . 
i was impressed with the quality of the suction cup . 
it s fairly responsive ,  and works well for that basic function . 
i do not have a mess by or near my spice rack . 
i ve been using them for years without a single complaint . 
the pot rack makes my kitchen look finished . 
the jug s symmetry flows and is more aesthetically pleasing . 
it makes a frozen pizza into a masterpiece . 
however ,  i have to question the plastic gear in the first place . 
love this item ,  i ordered them for all my cast iron pans . 
it took me days to drain this battery with my iphone num_extend
at this point in time i can t complain and am quiet satisfied . 
and you will never find a better price anywhere !  . 
i purchased this antenna to go along with the wilson sleek cellphone booster . 
i ve been using it for about six months . 
it is available from amazon and many italian food stores . mange !  . 
and that little windshield gripper really holds with zome zest ,  too . 
my next impression was how nice it looked . 
as one reviewer noted it sits nicely in the palm of my hand . 
we use them for everything from slicing bagels to tomatoes . 
i said nothing to her and yesterday this unit arrived . 
i ususally have on blowing in and the other blowing out . 
the vitamix company claims this is a juicer . 
this was before the days of the internets . 
we just had to have it ,  according to the little lady . 
love the case and you can pick from a bunch of colors . 
good color combination not to stark on contrasting . 
the rubber seals are simple ,  fit easily in any bottle . 
make sure you have a burner large enough  around  for the unit base . 
hooks nicely in the pen holder of my kindle fire hd pink case . 
excellent value and does what it s supposed to do fairly quickly . 
so if your trying to save a few $ watch the pricing . 
have four of them and use them several times a week . 
i put one over the washer and another over the dryer . 
you ve got to judge it for yourself before buying . 
they are of very high quality and very durable . 
so i stopped and just went without the foam ,  which is fine . 
 you won t need them if you use the filter instead  . 
true but by only num_num degrees or so . 
it works and everything ,  but not exactly num_num feet . 
no one was in sight in this bad part of town . 
the knife does all the work for you . 
i ve cooked a bbq pork roast and it turned out very moist . 
does not get hot and works perfectly on both devices . 
when you want to cut up big meat it takes a big blade . 
you never know when you need a pair . 
im a big fan of the infomercial too . 
i bought the cheapest and it works just fine . 
the num_extend is num_extend vs the num_extend one i bought . 
a good ,  sturdy pan that should last for years . 
we have had the grinder for num_num years or so . 
i bought this for my mother because she hates drinking cold water . 
bought this back in num_num and have never had an issue with it . 
it also increases the shock absorption and distribution when you drop it . 
some parts stay together just by pressure and gravity . 
a little on the heavy side ,  but has lots of power . 
i feel more confident using this roaster than an actual beer can . 
i love it and i have never gone wrong with this brand . 
the clip works great to hold it on pants ,  belts etc . 
i have no complaints at all about the machine . 
the attachments are easy to remove and store . 
each scoop has a tiny hole for drainage and pop out purposes . 
it s hard to tell just by looking at the picture . 
i am now ordering the donvier yogurt cheese maker . 
i have read most of the reviews and decided to buy this one . 
they are super easy to clean and they cubes pop out so easily . 
contacted the seller about product immediately responded and resent another one . 
these spice racks fit well in the kitchen cabinets . 
it easily holds the glass lid of my calphalon pans . 
it is very well worth the price to have a second bowl . 
the machine seems very sensitive to positioning of the pot . 
the lcd screen protector it s kind of crap . 
you put water and grounds in ,  and turn it on . 
it is pretty damn big and holds a lot of dog treats . 
works fast ,  makes good coffee thats nice and hot . 
plus ,  that method didn t come close to popping all the kernels . 
i put it in easily and it s worked so much better . 
my mom tried it and she loved it ,  too . 
to be honest ,  this easypak is perfectly fine at num_extend mah . 
the sound was very clear in indoors and was adequate outside . 
my husband went through num_num otterboxes to no avail . 
they stack compactly and also have a ring to keep them together . 
i love it and can t imagine my kitchen without it !  . 
and i am not using the softer slots . 
did exactly what it said it would do . 
this protects the front and the back of the product . 
i ve had it for about a year now . 
as previous reviews stated the cuts outs were rough . 
you can grab a fairly good amount the first time . 
i had no problem with sliding the phone in it . 
it works good and the glass is really strong and pretty think . 
my husband loves to use this when i cook . 
and for that this review is really only a num_extend
i bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy . 
noise isolation is fantastic ,  it puts you in a different num_extend
not much to say besides it fits my cast iron pan handle . 
this headset is soooo cool ,  i had to order another one . 
perfectly seasoned and amazing for a burger too . 
this filter works well ,  but i ve returned to using paper filters . 
i honestly don t know if the whole thing is just a sham . 
the sound quality was clear as day and night . 
works well with both android and apple phones . 
i ordered this pot as a community hot pot for work . 
i highly recommend this pan and all the chef s classic line . 
i will be taking it camping this spring and summer . 
the case is snug and feels very secure . 
so far this press is working pretty good . 
my phone is also old and the port is a little worn . 
i liked this so much i bought another one as a gift . 
lots of germs in the bottom of a sink as a norm . 
the press has a solid feel to it but is not heavy . 
our first wusthof set and we are very happy with them . 
i plan on keeping this with me at all times . 
this is hands down the best motorola headset i ve ever seen . 
it s excellent and i bought it based on all the good reviews . 
it fits the iphone num_extend perfectly and is easy to keep clean . 
this is a better quality product than i expected for the price . 
i folded them in half lengthwise before rolling up . 
comes with a cleaning brush and both work great . 
i use these for more and more things . 
best way to bring tender goodness back to bread . 
it has worked very well with good adjustments . 
after improvising with butter knives ,  rubber spatulas ,  etc . 
you are the most inept person i have ever num_extend
and i have to say ,  i have been pleased . 
you can tell htc takes a lot of pride in this phone . 
it would be great if a revised lid were fashioned . 
i am going to buy another one soon to have two pitchers . 
i saw it ,  and promptly ordered it on amazon . 
the era gives the option of disabling num_extend
if i call them ,  there are no issues whatsoever . 
the only draw back is the bowl is very heavy . 
it doesn t indent or bend out of shape like others do . 
that earns a num_num star rating from me . 
i am very impressed with the jambox ,  its truly packs a punch . 
i think this product is great and i would recommend it . 
you will not be disappointed in these skins . 
try that with zagg and the film stays in your pocket . 
i had both front and back protectors when i tried placing in case . 
i liked the paw print design on this cover . 
most aquarium stores can t get rid of these . 
great pan for cooking rice dishes ,  works in the oven too . 
if you haven t purchased one please do so immediately . 
now i don t know how i got along without them . 
but this worked perfectly for me over the months . 
either way ,  it s likely cheaper than buying from their store . 
i love my num_num cup glass measuring cup . 
it is a good thing that pfaltzgraff makes lots of items . 
the cinderella topper is smaller than a barbie doll torso and head . 
i am a fan of the lodge products .

i am taken aback by how well this thing works . 
i was glad that lissie had mentioned it .

came with everything needed for the num_num gallon brew . 
unless you pull it off your phone it will remain there . 
just what i needed for my iphone num_extend
i recommend this buyer for any replacement charger you need . 
compared to products costing $ and up ,  this is a good value . 
for the money ,  you won t find anything better . 
the blue holographic light is kind of cool to . 
you get all the vitamins you need from the juice . 
i m not sure however whether it is operator error . 
i like that it is compact and easy to store . 
it also functions if you want to make a football cake . 
i don t know what i did without this little gem . 
i saw this item recently and sent for it . 
i had some wide mouth jar mugs and no tops . 
i keep the lid on and i don t get greasy . 
no big deal but prevented me from giving num_num stars . 
i bought this for my mister coffee num_num cup coffee maker . 
tips are easy to use with or without a coupling . 
my kids call them the harry potter silverware . 
this knife can do it all and more . 
i think it is just fine for what it does .   . 
a family member saw us using this product and wanted one . 
the heaviness of the metal lets you know you have a quality product . 
to date ,  it doesn t look anything like other than brand new .

i prefer glass to plastic and like the weight of this bowl . 
the keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it .

the metal handle is thick and does not bend . 
i was a diehard motorola man ,  but lg has won me over .

i recommend this and will be ordering another for my mom . 
for the price ,  these glasses are great value . 
this works just fine to hold the cord for my iron . 
this works great and gets the salad nice and dry . 
i especially iike the little cord that plugs into the earphone plug . 
if you need protection ,  and you dont want to spend alot . 
the headphones that come with these are pretty much worthless . 
it also has a rubber safety thing ,  to avoid over pressurizing . 
i like that it uses the microusb connector to charge . 
a smaller stock pot would have been a nice addition to this set . 
my model shipped with ios num_extend installed and that was very fun . 
if you need table shakers ,  you might want something smaller . 
it won t pick up stuff that probably needs to be swept up . 
the iron was easy to fill by using a water bottle . 
a drawback to be able to use full function of num_num phones . 
the capacity is much too low to be useful with the ipad . 
i mistook the loaf pan for a smaller lasagna pan . 
and i find that it does not perk enough . 
keeps the phone safe from an accidental drop . 
i would definitely do more business with this seller if circumstances arise . 
my son only wishes we had given him the num_num quart mixer . 
dog hair is difficult to remove from upholstery . 
the ezopower charger burnt out within the first week .

and you don t destroy the food in the process . 
fantastic quality ,  good weight ,  beautiful design ,  good sizes . 
i liked them so much i placed a second order !  . 
it takes seconds to froth and works very well !  . 
this is lovely and sturdy ,  and easy to put the legs on . 
i have been making the regular and the cheese popovers . 
needs to be properly seasoned for use ,  but worth the trouble . 
working like a champ to replace my original . 
i am old and have owned many different types of glasses . 
i purchased this lovely platter ,  about a month ago . 
keeps beverage pipping hot for as long as num_num hours !  . 
i d buy it again if i ever needed to . 
this is really great for morning sandwiches on english muffins . 
and ,  i plan on trying almost each and every one . 
it doesn t take anytime at all to get it up and running . 
definitely purchasing from this seller again is this one decides to go bad . 
once it cracked ,  we knew it was time . 
easier than the jar i was using for my biscuits . 
i would highly recommend this product to anyone . 
recommended where a larger size can is needed . 
i have never had juicier chicken ,  perfectly cooked beef . 
also ,  i did trim it around the sound switch for easier access .

i just love it and so will you !  . 
i have tried this method ,  and the result is very num_extend
worth the price and the protection offered to my new matrix screen priceless .

got it on amazon ,  the prices simply cannot be beat . 
my quart ball jars fit nicely on all the shelves . 
the screen protectors arrived very quickly and were exactly as described . 
i got this to dispense candy in my office . 
i think it s a learning curve every baker has to go through . 
i also bought the frother and wow it works great . 
just dropped this thing in my jacket pocket along with my iphone cable . 
yes ,  these will fit that size machine also . 
i recomend it to whoever is looking for one . 
i do love this knife set ,  especially for the price . 
it is louder than some fans but it s nice to sleep to .

these are almost a straight bar with the corners rounded off .

the color is a bit different but close enough . 
we had this same presto popcorn popper before and it was great . 
then i found the corningware french mug at my local bullseye store . 
it s fit is the worst ,  at least on my ear . 
i have probably used num_num different garlic presses in my lifetime . 
i bought the only kind available at the local store . 
i like the fact that it is a minimalistic design . 
this phone is almost purrfect for me except . 
a few reviewers complained about the quality of this tool . 
it s the same pan that s been used for decades . 
if you can hang this from the ceiling ,  it s great . 
ran the base under some water ,  and they popped out quickly .

i only wish jawbone hadn t made any changes . 
i love it so much i had to buy another one . 
they re all cast iron ,  and all a matching set . 
it s was smooth and clear and had know problems with bubbles . 
i requested this set of rollers for my birthday last year . 
whew !  so ah ,  don t use the clip under any circumstances . 
i ve definitely gotten much more than my money s worth . 
i will more than likely purchase more of thesein different colors . 
i don t expect to see a brand name so large . 
i am not big on kitchen gadgets ,  but i love this one . 
just passing on one person s impressions so far . 
i find this my perfect answer to that need . 
the cell antenna seems to be working ok .

long before amazon was anything but a river in s america . 
assuming you re outside ,  a branch will probably do the same job .

i love it and i use it all the time . 
now there s no reason to keep a landline . 
this product is nice and does the job well . 
which i just use in mini bundt pans . 
the smartest purchase i made when buying my cast iron pans . 
nor do they back their products with an adequate guarantee .

my daughter saved up and purchased this for herself . 
very pumped about this i have recommended to three friends . 
i don t think you could find a better knife for the price . 
we now add other items to the blend and flavored greek yogurt . 
i didn t know what i was looking for  besides a good price  . 
they are great for warming up already prepared food . enjoy !  . 
it only takes one mishap to land a surprise burn . 
saves us using propane oven  in rv  and saves on electricity . 
also ,  it s so convenient as far as cleaning . 
it is big ,  so think through where you will store it . 
it s one brand i go to first for any small kitchen appliance . 
however ,  if you do plan on grinding spices ,  buy num_extend
i am glad that i have back ups for when i need them . 
i needed to download a more recent superuser thru the problems button . 
it s a very high quality product that won t disappoint you . 
i was so excited when i received them in the mail . 
i have no complains about this excellent piece of technology . 
the top burr is easily removed on both ,  making cleaning easier . 
bought the second and was very careful ,  yet same problem . 
the cord is short but i don t find it a problem . 
this took my old card and cut it pretty well . 
the num_num and num_num inch ones are the two i ordered . 
all the features of the single charger from original manufacturer . 
a little heavy but that is necessary for stability . 
and that is something i have been trying to do for num_num years . 
this is a great product by kitchen aid . 
and the free bunt insert is neat as well . 
i tried armorsuit ,  and am very happy with this protector . 
the buttons are easy to push and read and are very colorful . 
unless you re prone to being jostled or just messy . 
no lag ,  no screen delay ,  no issue flicking and scrolling . 
i wasn t too fond of the ones that just snap in back . 
it makes a beautiful cake and is easy to clean . 
perhaps it is because it is an older model . 
i highly recommend this carpet cleaner over renting one . 
the air bubbles went away pretty quickly ,  too . 
but i wish the velcro covered more of the strap . 
the  dirty water  tank holds a lot and it is easy to empty . 
but it is way bigger than my oxo stainless lasagna turner . 
whomever invented the side opening can opener was a genius . 
awesome product and does exactly what i need it too . 
so i decided to check out amazon ,  and there it was . 
however ,  all blades are very sharp and cut like a dream . 
if you enjoy bottled wine this is essential . 
friends and family have used this on any number of different manufacturer phones . 
i use these to make crumpets and they work wonderfully for that purpose . 
it s not too noisy ,  and pretty easy to clean up . 
it s a great size and a great price for the size . 
tengo el facebook el twitter y otras redes sociales . 
incredibly easy to use with no burned kernels . 
i am using it with the stock antenna . 
these are so sturdy ,  yet still aesthetically appealing . 
this may be why some folks are experiencing slow sifting . 
works well and charges my num_extend around num_num times per full charge . 
i would highly recommend this for anyone with a mophie air pack !  . 
it heats up quickly ,  steam lasts for a long time . 
i hope this lasts as long as my old one . 
it has a nice protective cover and is small and easy to store . 
they do exactly what they say ,  and sound very good . 
great for drying off all kinds of fruits and vegetables . 
i have yet to test if dishwasher safe . 
i think of the rug doctor when i think of this happening . 
i ve bought a few of these and some have died . 
i bought this to replace my large strainer that s many years old . 
my only complaint is that they tend to rust eaily . 
i can about see thru those slices of meat . 
works great and is still on the phone . 
when hubby got a blackberry ,  i ordered these right away . 
the num_extend is a num_num out of num_extend
neither could cook the amount of bacon that this will . 
it came in very quickly and was easy to put on my phone . 
i use measure cups for all my cooking and baking needs . 
this one you fill up the unit from the front . 
one can safely use a hand mixer in metal bowls like this . 
update :  used this to grind peppercorns yesterday for kung pau chicken . 
instruction pamphlet was very clear and contained diagrams . 
needing to unplug something to turn it off is less than ideal . 
it s oem ,  works as expected ,  and holds the charge . 
i like it so much  , i ordered a second . 
i use them with the gold tone filter . 
it will last forever and work just like it s supposed to . 
i was shocked to see how well made this was . 
i have done triple batches of cookies  they barely fit in the bowl  . 
i placed it on my phone and it is working great . 
the crunchy kind that one can enjoy and spend a little time with . 
the are stainless steel with comfortable soft grips . 
very comfortable ,  clear volume and great fittting around your neck . 
i figured i had lucked out and had gotten a  good  one . 
it seems sturdy ,  worked well ,  and charges fast . 
this one looks like it will also provide excellent service . 
i ve wasted a lot of money on a lot of other ones . 
turning the round top tightens the clamp onto the vent louvers . 
the hard case in the rear will prevent any penetration from the rear . 
they work great for a variety of items not just dishes . 
helps to keep your pots in good condition and clean . 
otherwise it is exactly the same as the original filter . 
i have to say that these pans are very nice . 
nicely priced ,  i m ordering another one for myself . 
it will look great at your desk or even on your nightstand . 
this popper is so cheap and so simple to use . 
but it just looks off ,  something in the details i suppose . 
the buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides . 
i highly reccommend it for the price that you are charged . 
this is one of the best headsets i ve ever used . 
work fine in the microwave and no problem in dishwasher . 
for that alone ,  it deserves all five stars . 
most players can only play the very compressed num_extend files . 
it presses on the sides of your head . 
the phone had been reset to original factory settings . 
i ve never had a dead spot with this phone . 
one of my favorites was a seidio active case for my evo num_extend
product arrived quickly and i assembled it in appx . 
the behind the ear design means that the device is very stable . 
it s great for making hot dips for parties . 
i have had this battery for over num_num months now . 
i ve used mine hundreds of times and it is still going strong . 
i had to use the attachments to clean under furniture . 
its really easy to slip the phone in and out of . 
at one store ,  i found a variety called click n save . 
i also live in an area of high humidity . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
there was a lot of gummy residue left . 
the blender i bought came with this attachment . 
i plug and charged and it charged my phone fast just like before . 
i can actually do more when my ipad is charging . 
i ve had several of these little grinders in a few different brands . 
when done place toasted side up on a paper plate . 
homemade bread shouldn t look like a factory loaf ,  anyway . 
the num_extend took num_num minutes to fully charge of my iphone num_num from %
contacted the company and they sent another one at no cost . 
scratching your cones means you will remove the chrome . 
would like a bit more height since we like strong coffee . 
i was only getting num_num hours of use from my evo num_extend
this tape works awesome in sealing the phone . 
i would recommend this to anyone needing a droidx cover door . 
this is the best invention to use for slicing bread . 
my signal strength without the booster is about num_extend
the sharpener is very easy to use and makes the knives super sharp . 
love the case and use it all the time . 
the plastic handle appears to be well attached and strong enough . 
i have ordered other similar types ,  which promptly fell apart . 
it holds multiple knives of various shapes and sizes . 
i still get three bars  dots now with ios num_extend
the rubber surround is like a lint magnet . 
one time i was talking on my phone . 
i gave this as a gift and they really like this screen protector . 
only buy this if you know how to install it and are confident . 
only one of the earbuds can be worn while driving . 
then i reattached the trash can and brace . 
makes hanging my work slacks and jeans a breeze . 
i m guessing the silicone acts as an insulator . 
included case provides protection along with the num_extend
i expect it will last for a very long period of time . 
it keeps everything i store in it very fresh . 
wish i looked closer at them and notice that they didn t . 
easy to wash and have ready for the next cup . 
keep up the good work with this item !  !  . 
the cord is reasonably long and in general is well made . 
perfect for making a pizza with room to spare . 
i love oxo products ,  and this is no exception . 
it keeps the coffee or tea hot all day  and well into tomorrow  . 
but they are there just in case !  highly recommended . 
replacing my caphalon with all clad pots and pans . 
the presto num_num is the one i decided on . 
this was just what i was looking for . 
never really liked that ,  and had to find a space for it . 
easy to use ,  very durable ,  cuts fast and stays sharp . 
replaced my motorola headset with this after losing the second one again . 
i feel like the price was reasonable for what i purchased . 
ok so product arrived literally num_num days after the order was placed . 
case fits great on my phone and protects it nicely . 
i will keep mine out of oven ,  too . 
i bought this for my mom for christmas . 
it is a great item and a great price . 
i m a novice cook and have been trying my hand at biscuits . 
these protectors provides great scratch free protection for my phone . 
after my review ,  they worked to replace it and it fit fine . 
i got this for my daughter for christmas . 
it looks great ,  cuts great and is very easy to hold . 
does fit oddly with a screen protector ,  though . 
comfort is around a num_num out of num_extend
all in all the headphones did exactly what they re supposed to do . 
kind of a must have for every cook . 
the big clear loop keeps the headset on my ear . 
legs are a must if you plan to use this outdoors . 
it didnt boil on low ,  cooked evenly and didnt burn my stew . 
my whole family uses the stuff ,  in fact . 
either buy the bigger unit or two of these . 
makes it easy to cook dinner for my little boy . 
is a wonderful size and the lid is great . 
not much longer than microwaver ,  but way better . 
so as long as i dont wreck its all good . 
i thought i could do just as well for less money . 
washes easily by hand or in dishwasher as well . 
i basically cook all my meals for the week in it . 
have not used yet but they arrived very quickly . 
it also seemed to get tacky after a while . 
i just got this pan a few days ago . 
this case is awesome !  the silicone protects the phone very well . 
purchased the usb cables needed to accomplish this . 
after opening the jelly the rim gets sticky . 
the bunn num_extend that i purchased early in feb . 
it is about an inch thick and porous . 
i always have great experiences with anker batteries . 
this cutter is good quality ,  easy to use and clean . 
this fan is whisper quiet ,  even at the highest speed . 
the shipping was very fast and very well packed . 
not good for every device such as a tablet . 
i put a newspaper or something in my lap to set it on . 
great wooden handle ,  very sturdy and comfortable in your hands . 
when one was broken i bought this box of num_extend
the remaining uncut cake looks attractive even with slices removed . 
on startup ,  ovi thinks i don t have an account . 
i felt little like i was buying her a vaccuum cleaner . 
oxygen is the enemy of opened wine and oils . 
holds the phone well ,  even on my motorcycle handlebars . 
looks more modern ,  but otherwise ,  works exactly the same . 
i have two houses and needed a spare for peel and eat shrimp . 
i am soooo happy that i bought this num_num years ago . 
i didn t and it came out within a few weeks . 
i finally put this up on my metal  ground plane  roof . 
it plugs into the cigarette lighter and has a compact ,  coiled cord . 
these are great glass containers and the sculptured designs are nice . 
very well made product ,  easy to clean and easy to use . 
the num_extend and num_extend sizes may be what you re looking for !  . 
it works as it should and the retractable cord is a huge plus . 
never had any problems; never falls out my ear . 
it does a great job making milk shakes . 
i have been very happy with this over the summer . 
i think the frame for the young press has helped protect the glass . 
it still gets warm if held to long but it s well made . 
it keeps it s temperature and is completely submersible for super easy cleaning . 
they are weather friendly and can withstand the rain . 
i also recommend the caliber iii digital thermometer hygrometer . 
my large extended family does a yankee swap on christmas mornings . 
lost my iphone ,  replaced it and ordered another magpul with out hesitation . 
it works and it is so convenient to have around . 
i will purchase more when i run out !  . 
i scrubbed for hours ,  and will reseason it . 
i like how it wraps around the front of the phone . 
third party apps reported the device as only having num_extend of ram . 
just remember that you are not buying a otter box case . 
this is a great cereal bowl for work and home . 
the stainless steel basket ,  lid and stem all seem of adequate quality . 
 you can still tell where the max fill line is . 
just lost a bit of color and the corners got scratched up . 
this headset does the trick . take the time to adjust . 
it is beautifully made and really the best for general cooking purposes . 
well ,  now it is only two of the three . 
a must have for anyone in the kitchen !  . 
but what i know is it comes in nice package . 
i have owned calphalon exclusively for num_num years . 
so this time around i decided to get an external pack . 
not only that ,  but it still tasted great after all that time . 
some smaller handles will pass through the holes . 
it came in and was just as advertised . 
filters are significantly cheaper ,  although not available everywhere you turn . 
we ve had this toaster for a couple of months now . 
it does a good job of avoiding background noise . 
glad i made this purchase; just wish the price were lower !  . 
if you make meat loaf ,  this is a must . 
only fans that drew the air from the room were affected . 
this one is as nice as i ve seen for the money . 
tip :  make and dump the first num_num to num_num pots . 
seems like it will stay on the phone pretty well . 
they are one of those multitasking tools that should be in every kitchen . 
you can never have too much cheese cloth really . 
just a continuation to how happy i am . 
just recently ,  i plugged it in and it didn t come on . 
wouldn t want to have to use it for large quantities though . 
you have to figure that eventually gravity will take its course . 
like the features that you can cook different items on each side . 
not very big or heavy ,  so easy to carry and travel with . 
the insert makes draining the pasta a snap . great quality . 
overall it does a good job for a tiny vac . 
it s not perfect ,  but it is versatile and hardworking . 
the galaxy num_extend is an expensive handheld personal device that needs solid protection . 
i suppose they simply couldn t handle the texas heat . 
my daughter loves all the different color cases . 
i m very impressed with the quality of this cover . 
i recommend it to anyone that wants to go jogging with them . 
much more easily and precisely than other knives . 
water gets really hot ,  and coffee comes out tasting good . 
this is a must have for smart phone users that have removable batteries . 
very quick to put on and take off . 
thankfully ,  there were three of them because i ruined the first two . 
most people do not even know i am on a bluetooth . 
what a pleasure this sharpener is to use . 
i love my cooking and this has added nicely to my repertoire . 
this is a fine product but the handle is a bit thin . 
it is very sturdy ,  smooth ,  and of course heavy . 
the selection was minimal and they were all in the range of $
it looks great but its for show not for protection . 
i haven t had an issue using it yet . 
i am by no standards a particularly healthy eater . 
i like it because it is a convenient outdoor grilling alternative . 
i love hard boiled eggs ,  but hate the guess work . 
it slices tomatoes with ease ,  even extra ripe ones . 
however i borrowed it for my iphone and it s great too . 
we replaced a much less expensive manual opener with this . 
my wife and i bought ours in num_extend
it s otherwise perfect and is easily one of my favorite travel chargers . 
the steel is long so it s good for knives of all sizes . 
it will keep it pleasantly warm for over num_num hours . 
it came out discolored ,  but still fully intact . 
this is the second of these i ve had . 
we re very pleased with it and use it often . 
we use all types of batter for the pancakes . 
these should last forever if you don t drop them . 
do not put the entire thing in the dishwasher . 
this adapter works with every connector i have . 
although i still wouldn t be leaving it on the bar . 
most cooks will get by just fine with the num_num inch utility knife . 
i hope to get another great deal on other calphalon products at amazon . 
i wanted something to protect my cell phone screen from getting scratched . 
i had to cut it in half and it was a little messy . 
you can t go wrong with a cuisinart product . 
she also wanted a stand to match her sanus tv stand . 
battery is a little low but thats okay for a cheap speaker . 
we ve since purchased another rack for our new apartment . 
with those two improvements ,  i would have given it five stars . 
works just like a regular headset ,  but has a weird fit . 
set them on trivets and serve right at the table . 
i like it so much i bought a second one for my wife . 
it doesn t restrict water flow hardly at all . 
my grandson has one for over num_num years . 
in most cases this attachment will eliminate the need for a food processor . 
we own this vacuum and it has performed wonderfully for several years . 
this one is okay but can t handle quite as much food . 
i haven t had a problem with water in the handle or rusting . 
large enough to stick num_num garlic cloves in at num_extend
i got mine locally at sur la table . 
i thought it would be the same as the factory sent one . 
these bags are much better then the regular s sized bags . 
they hold my shower curtain an the liner an thats heavy . 
the medium is the one i use most . 
things don t stick to it just line your pan with it . 
you can t appreciate it until you use it !  . 
light weight so it s not an issue carrying it around . 
the glossy stainless steel is attractive and prevents sticking . 
i also use bottled water ,  but that can get expensive . 
but ,  this is pretty much a user error . 
this thing is tiny ,  light and charges at num_num full amp num_extend
if it was noise canceling it would have gotten num_num stars . 
i recommend these for yourself ,  and as a great gift idea . 
i will update the review if my opinion changes . 
this was my first foray into the bt department . 
the cap opens and closes without burning your fingers . 
i really puts all the others that i ve seen to shame . 
don t make the same mistake that i did with my spaghetti cutter . 
it also doesn t weigh anywhere near what those old handsets weighed . 
light for me to handle but sturdy enough to not just fall apart . 
its hilarious and adorable at the same time . 
they do what they are suppose to do . 
the reason i bought this pan is that the num_extend qt . 
there has been no falling apart or senseless breaking . 
the cylinder that holds the beans or gain is tall . 
it s more than fine for most web browsing . 
also ,  i just love the very simple look of the plain cookware . 
still use these ,  num_num years after purchasing them . 
it is an excellent size to make an omlette for num_num people . 
also cant be used to sync your bold with your pc . 
this is also true when taking it off the rack . 
even a num_extend mah battery pack will only charge an ipad half way . 
on motorola s mistake ,  they sent me a num_extend instead . 
this may be the single best cleaning device i have ever bought . 
it worked well for about num_num  maybe num_extend minutes and then fell apart . 
you don t have the mess of using a spoon . 
should have bought it in the first place . 
flimsy ,  but works for me and the price is right . 
today s ge is a piece of poorly made junk . 
can use the phone gps and other functions continuously without draining the battery . 
that will happen with any of these if you cook it too long . 
also purchased the matching toaster oven and it was damaged scratched . 
the round board is num_num inches in diameter . 
good quality cable and is htc oem . cant beat it . 
but he also says that pocket lint sticks to it . 
works just as good as the day i bought this . 
callen that it was not packed well ,  however . 
you just need to watch a video on how to do it . 
not difficult to use and makes great coffee . 
i usually find their recommendations useful and this one is great . 
its not the strongest quality pitcher ,  but it does the job well . 
plus this pan was not heavy at all and easy to handle . 
these dough hooks are strong enough for the toughest dough . 
the large handles are great and fit my hand for easy use . 
a pie might be too heavy if stacked . 
caller confirmed very little air noise disturbance and great voice num_extend
it fit nicely into my existing belt clip . 
so ,  we just pile num_num or three on a muffin . 
it is so easy to switch it up !  . 
excellent quality with very fine mesh stainless steel screen . 
these are the right filters for a chemex system . 
easy clean up and love the durability of stainless steal . 
bought this ti simulate the lung flute which is more expensive . 
just picked up one for my mother because ours work so well . 
the original battery in my samsung galaxy phone began to die . 
i have been using otterbox products for a few years now . 
note that the outside is stainless ,  but the inside will stain . 
her phone came on and her charger suddenly was working again . 
story coffee beans ,  keeping brown sugar fresh and soft . 
anyway ,  this case fits the voyager pro perfectly . 
at the other end of the stem is a knob . 
it s a little deeper ,  but narrows a little at the bottom . 
this grater is not something you want loose in your drawer . 
then i spotted a wooden pastry roller here on amazon and got that . 
so far it is holding up and fits snug . 
i would not hesitate to do business with this company again . 
i mention this in case you do the same thing . 
i reach for this spatula whenever i need one . 
it requires a pot with fairly tall sides . 
owned a less expensive bread maker which finally failed . 
bottom line ,  very nice coffee pot at a budget price . 
i think with a longer handle it would be better . 
grip ,  this tool is very durable that you can trust . 
i want it for spreading butter ,  peanut butter ,  or whatever . 
there s a lot of apps for this phone . 
in this mug !  i ve bought two of them !  . 
i prefer to use the healthy extra virgin olive oil . 
at a beach house ,  the wine rack did fine ,  no rust . 
it fits perfectly on the door and doesn t take up much room . 
some side scraping needed ,  but very little at that . 
my oxo small cookie scoop broke after less than a year . 
therefore i have never experienced the too hot bird on the spout . 
these work just as well as more expensive screen protectors i ve tried . 
not one of those thin paper like protectors . 
i can t say enough good things about it . 
i make my cakes and everybody notice the difference . 
it heats up quickly and it s so easy to use . 
proper use of oil prevents most food from sticking . 
i wanted a unit to be able to charge multiple devices . 
they nest nicely in the drawer and feel good in the hand . 
it is an attractive set and will look nice with any table setting .

ordered this to go with the num_num quart cuisinart stainless sauce pan . 
i use it to make one pot dinners . 
just used them to sync my ipod with my computer . 
this is our third one of these granpappy s . 
there are no sharp edges to cut yourself . 
the blue isn t bland and the feel isnt  plasticy  . 
every evening of romance should start with the whir of a dirt devil . 
all of my plates are corelle and none have chipped or broken yet . 
so far ,  i ve been very pleased with the oven . 
the iphone num_extend fingerprint reader worked fine after the installation . 
works better than some of the more expensive cases . 
they are easy to use and you cant beat the price . 
i hope we are invited when she does use it . 
it could be very useful during presentations and other applications . 
i use this professionally in my small catering business . 
the measure very accurately and make baking very simple . 
maybe you picked a color that looks cool . 
i know there are cheaper ones out there of poor quality . 
they are as heavy as the cookware which was a real surprise . 
they appear to be a very high quality ,  as well . 
and orange and pink . apple logo is concealedconsapple logo is concealed . 
i am looking forward to doing a batch of applesauce . 
simply remember to let the air out when you are done . 
if you own any bowl ,  you should purchase this item . 
got it yesterday ,  used it last night works great . 
i ve also just used the goldtone filter with great results . 
do yourself a favor and try the french press system . 
i only use it on soft things ,  veggies and whatnot . 
i ve had it for two years now and it still works fine . 
i was able to get it at a really great price . 
this is the same battery that came with the phone . 
these were the basis for a great christmas gift for our oldest . 
an added bonus is that the call quality is much clearer on the num_extend
it s worked so well ,  and protected it from so much . 
we tried these for thanksgiving and the crusts came out very consistent . 
it is sturdy ,  effective ,  and easy to clean . 
it charge my galaxy num_extend battery close to %
have to cut down to fit ,  other than that its great . 
just a bit of soap and spray it off . 
the buttons respond well and never feel loose or fragile . 
the product works just like it supposed to . 
a word of warning :  ours broke from putting it in the dishwasher . 
i begin with the onions and meat diced very small . 
remember to restart the phone after adding or removing apps or updates . 
since then ,  we have lost only three to breakage . 
my ipod touch is in one as is my blackberry curve . 
three minutes  baking time on the number num_num setting does the job nicely . 
however ,  it does take a while find an earbud that fits better . 
i have charged two cell phones at once and it works great . 
a person below gave it four stars after cutting a chicken with it . 
i ve had this product for over num_num months now . 
i ve owned this set for over a year . 
i can only fit num_num of the herringbone pattern coasters into this holder . 
i measured to be sure the size is correct ,  and it is . 
i have a step ladder but it is heavy and hard to move . 
this garlic press is so easy to use . 
dropped it several times but it still works fine . 
gave this to my wife for christmas and made me a hero . 
i love this purple love design crystal hard skin case . 
the only downside is the pan is sort of heavy . 
ordered num_num more after finding the first one so useful . 
i don t think there was one positive review . 
this rack makes quick clean up a priority . 
i am impressed that they can be so inexpensive . 
maybe too tight ?  but then i do have a big head . 
you re not going to get google sky maps on here . 
when i try to time it myself i always burn it . 
the website says not to ,  i trust the website . 
it s a burr grinder at a very attractive price . 
don t make the num_num gallon any more ,  and num_extend
and seems longer than any of the earbuds i have purchased . 
it makes great ice cream when you follow the instructions carefully . 
i bought several backups as i have a tendency to lose  em . 
they cover the buttons on the phone which isn t too bad . 
in my experience ,  anker batteries meet ,  or exceed oem . 
i d say it s a good little unit for the price . 
the suction cup design is the best i ve used . 
i got these for my ipod touch and they work very well . 
i received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review . 
that was the reason we bought it and it s great . 
the power pack is useful with my smartphone and tablet . 
but then i disassembled ,  reassembled ,  tried again ,  and it worked . 
i use a lot of cast iron both in cooking and baking . 
it s reasonably priced ,  portable ,  and it just plain works . 
the hanging line around the edge is also a nice added feature . 
if you are looking for that get a battery in the num_extend range . 
it is great and so much cheaper than in stores . 
i use this thing to dock my droid on when i am sleeping . 
probably one of the smallest and lightest i ve num_extend
they enjoy laying on the holmes product as this true hepa is running . 
i was weary of using any of these ,  from any brand . 
there is no pressure canner made as perfect as the all american . 
i have found the battery life in this one to be very good . 
i love this !  the neutral color is perfect in my kitchen . 
my girlfriend ,  her hubby ,  and children are popcorn fanatics . 
i am happy with it as i always am . 
am giving my free case to my daughter !  . 
it was easy to pair and the sound is good . 
the tanks are very easy to remove for emptying and filling ,  too . 
i ve owned the plantronics voyager pro+ for over a year . 
i use it more than air conditioning when it s hot . 
the original one lasted at least num_num years . 
i use my phone quite frequently ,  so this is saying a lot . 
this site is also where you register and enter your credit card information . 
this food processor is a wonderful gift from my husband . 
it s just great ,  and i will never have to replace it . 
it is a necessary addition to any kitchen . 
works well but is a bit longer then i need . 
this cutter cut my pie dough to the perfect size . 
im not too concerned because of the price . 
i used to blend smoothies with ice and frozen fruit . 
then my family enjoyed a delicious steak meal . 
i have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult . 
also use the smallest amount of flour that the recipe calls for . 
but it can rest on the rim of a bowl and still work . 
i use them for placing hot containers on from the stove or oven . 
the ends are very solid and it feels very sturdy . 
i used these all the time for indoor as well as outdoor cooking . 
well ,  lo and behold i had turned on the left burner . 
the headset is convenient to store in a cargo pocket folded up . 
i ground the beans and tamped them like with the krups filter . 
great with veggies cheese and anything you might use it for . 
i found that it requires two hands to slide it into place . 
every other review which mentions noise is % accurate . 
you can charge the phone and access all the ports . 
probably the same stuff they used to assemble it . 
no belt clip would be my only complaint . 
this pan is one of my best buys on amazon . 
this is a great set but i agree with a previous reviewer . 
this sprayer is greatly recommendedfor those wishing to save money instead ofbuying spray . 
the reviews of this bialetti are right on . 
these stoppers do a great job of prolonging the freshness of the wine . 
i purchased some glass jars to freeze and refridgerate juices i have made . 
i fully charged my iphone num_extend and still had plenty of battery left . 
it s so nice to buy in bulk like this . 
fit is perfect except for the port dust covers . 
its awesome and you can feel how sturdy these are . 
i first tried it with the apples and they worked great . 
probably the hardest thing about making pasta is making the dough itself . 
i think i dropped my phone once or twice with this case on . 
unfortunately ,  not part of most knife sets ,  must be bought separately . 
i bought this thinking i was walking into a bad deal . 
even cooking bacon on one for num_num minutes distorts the plate . 
easy to work with ,  the rings are well worth the money . 
item was shipped and received in a timely manner . 
dropped my phone once and it gave cushion to the fall . 
if it s not the universal model it will not work with verizon . 
the cord is also smooth and round so wipes off easily . 
this knife comes sharp and holds its edge well . 
it does look well brazed and well fitted . 
a search yielded a youtube video that took care of that . 
i expect these glasses to last many years . 
this is cheaper to use in the long tun . 
then i bought a bunch more for christmas presents . 
i was obliged to make a comment because of another review . 
it s really quite attractive and looks so nice on my stainless refrigerator . 
so i bought this because i know it s a great pot . 
they are ,  by far ,  the best pair that i have owned . 
screw the gasketed top on and put it on the fire . 
i did a great amount of research before purchasing this unit . 
i ordered this bundt pan after reading a positive review from cooks illustrated . 
i use this to charge a samsung captivate and a jawbone headset . 
i ve installed these on four devices now with no issue s . 
i had let my previous filter go for about num_num months . 
i was able to cook a stew in about fifteen minutes . 
at the color of the effluent after two passes . 
it allows usb memory sticks to be used with tablet . 
not a lot to say about a cheap phone case . 
i use these all the time and the rock !  . 
the machine requires approximately num_num ounce per cleaning . 
read the reviews about this pan and decided to try it . 
this is really the best product from jabra . 
what more could you ask ?  best i ve ever owned . 
on the plus side ,  it cooks things very well . 
it works great !  easy to setup and instructions were clearly written . 
i pump five times ,  and it mists like avalon . 
and we have three other wusthof grand prix knives . 
throw away your electric can opener or give it to the goodwill . 
these two machines are both great for different uses . 
i used it til i couldnt use it anymore . 
we love it and so does my son . 
for the price i had nothing to loose . 
smaller whisks would require much more muscle for the job . 
the best way to load them seems to be securely on their side . 
overall ,  i have no problem rating it with num_num stars . 
bodium makes the best french presses and its attractive too . 
they seem to work pretty good though so far . 
did a great job as it was designed . 
home videos show clearly on my flat screen and movies display very well . 
however as i got new case the screen protector peeled . 
i ordered this for my husband and one for myself in white . 
that said ,  there s not and i still use the set . 
now she id in charge of the pies for thanksgiving . 
this is the same capacity as my old battery . 
he was pleased with it ,  hardly know it s on . 
other types of bacterium will produce more of kefir type of yogurt . 
it is quick to heat and easy to use . 
it s not perfect ,  but it gets the job done . 
on the iphone itself it holds really well though . 
i bought two ,  one for canola oil and one for olive oil . 
the price is so low that is unbelievable . 
they feel very smooth and comfortable on the skin . 
i ve found this to be an interesting addition . 
i was holding out to get an android . 
i m now baking like a pro thanks to this machine . 
these products were in perfect condition and worked perfectly . 
i still saw the mark so he cleaned it again . 
have it in my car and use it when needed . 
there is no surface narrow enough to deploy the clips . 
we have a large popcorn machine and we use this with it . 
this is definitely the case you should look into buying !  . 
cheap and works great as a right angle connector . 
they are loud and clear when having phone conversations . 
running it through the dishwasher is even easier . 
my friend loved mine ,  so i got her this one . 
i have used both and they do a good job on vegetables . 
side note :  use peanut oil when deep frying . 
it is balanced and glides through the meat . 
it comes with some skins ,  which are cool ,  as well . 
if other chemicals are present in water then one should consider specialized filters . 
i may buy one more for olive oil . 
the smell at start up never went away . 
for a corded headset solution ,  this headset is excellent . 
the cord being able to disconnect is such a wonderful idea . 
you get exactly as many paper towels as you want !  !  . 
bought this spatula based on all the previous reviews . 
i m not sure why they call this num_num cup . 
easy to clean ,  brews in about num_num minutes . 
the weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand . 
the coffee is delicious and the unit in nice and heavy . 
my grandmother had the percolator going all day long . 
using this ,  there will truly be completely smooth mashed potatoes . 
i expect oxo products to be well designed and built . 
the only problem i ve had is keeping them for myself . 
i d still take the stick over the others for actual work . 
cutlery ,  cookware etc depending on my intended application . 
they appear well made and create a tight seal . 
the handle is nice and fat without being cumbersome . 
it also keeps the phone pretty well protected with the leather casing . 
as a result ,  so no water collects there in the dishwasher . 
this is because navigation ,  music and call volume are controled independently . 
i ordered these for a cocktail party that i am actually having tonight . 
there is no better tea kettle on the market . 
it does what you tell it to to . 
haven t used it yet but have other anolon cookware . 
i ve had a couple of these for years . 
not a hardshell case but that is what i was looking for . 
it gets hot enough to sear and mark the meat . 
but it is not meant for any heavy duty chopping . 
as other reviewers noted ,  the top is flimsy . 
i confirmed my suspicions by calling lifeproof and speaking with customer service . 
charges the phone and was not that expensive . 
this not only tenderizes the meat but terrorizes it in to submission . 
with proper care it should last a long time . 
works perfectly like new battery and holds charge like a new one . 
this fits into my num_num year old original droid incredible . 
the case ,  though ,  will fall apart at the seam . 
the blue light looks nice in the dark . 
it houses the nutmeg in the top which is nice . 
it had enough juice to recharge her phone . 
then i looked into where it was shipping from ,  china . 
also would have loved if the dial had a glass cover . 
but thats what i expected for the price . 
this unit is extremely handy for quick ,  everday spills and messes . 
it snaps completely around the phone leaving all buttons and charging port uncovered . 
it looks like it s from a fancy restaurant or hotel . 
this processor is almost identical including the num_num watt motor . 
it is hard to get the dasher cleaned off . 
this atlantic dvd storage case makes attractive dvd storage a reality . 
sometimes trial and error is where you learn . 
it does what a baster should do ,  it bastes . 
granted ,  it s actually a pretty tough piece of equipment . 
the clip is very tight and should keep the cover on your belt . 
compared to buying from verizon these are uber cheap and work fine . 
thick high quality plastic covered in thick high quality rubber . 
this was legit oem and it works as it should . 
this tablecloth has a very nice design and sheen . 
i have no complains for the price i paid for these protectors . 
this charger is not an apple brand but works great . 
i received an entirely new  not refurbished  phonesuit . 
don t have iphone num_num anymore but loved the color combination . 
nice compact design and very easy to use . 
exact match for the htc evo num_extend great deal . 
you can t imagine going back to side cutters after using these . 
small sizes are great to reach in spice containers . 
i really like the storage box for the blades . 
but i m not big on the baking cakes and cookies kinda person . 
i had mine for over a year and it cooks everything great . 
vary the oil from a little to alot . 
the outside leather still looks and feels great . 
bought this as a gift along with num_num matching scoops . 
it is the sharpest knife i have used . 
i bought the other attachments and they are great . 
just let it cool ,  empty any unpopped corn and wipe it out . 
her phone look good and she like the colour . 
i thought they only made blenders but they make a good oven also . 
but this differs from my jawbone with distance from the phone . 
the new one did not heat up well and i contacted amazon . 
i can t wait for next year s tomato sauce prep . 
great sizes and my want to be baker husband loves them . 
so i took a chance and my husband and i love this grill . 
seems to be durable after several months of daily use . 
i use to have a droid x and that was ok also . 
this one produces a huge waffle ,  enough to fill one person . 
i use it almost daily and it has maintained sharpness . 
picking up the kettle and having the spout open immediately for easy pouring . 
they don t twist when you grab a large steak on the grill . 
so far so good ,  it gives me multiple full charges on my num_extend
i also ordered a new case directly from them at the same time . 
when i compared this coffeemaker to others ,  it was far more solid . 
once the weight starts jiggling ,  cook for num_num minutes to an hour . 
they come in handy ,  good to have around the kitchen . 
what s even better is that you haven t spent a fortune . 
very nice quality for the price !  i love this . 
begin adding the rest of the flour ,  slowly while mixing . 
slightly pricey ,  but you get what you pay for . 
i ordered this and sent to friends as a gift . 
i really get sick of cooking but i love this cooker . 
both those problems are now gone with this new trackpad . 
she just loves it and has nothing but good things to say . 
using nova battery tester  android  found my battery just under num_extend
low profile and nice fit makes a great ,  inexpensive case . 
this audio cable is great for in the car . 
i am retired and am finally learning how to cook beyond the basics . 
there is a short learning curve ,  getting used to the cutting action . 
i have two toddler boys so our family room rug needs cleaning often . 
i received it in good condition ,  no scratches or dents . 
to dispense the honey ,  simply press down on the handle . 
also the price is not bad compared to other similar blenders . 
it works well for pretty much anything you hve  cooked  up to prepare . 
after researching and researching ,  i decided to purchase the corner bakery . 
i just wash them with warm soapy water and put them up . 
you cannot produce this oil by a fast chopping method . 
it is of good quality and fairly easy to clean after use . 
this vacuum may well replace it for % of our vacuuming needs . 
i left my phone on top of the car . 
i haven t been sorry ,  it is the best in mixers . 
however it still does a very good job . 
it keeps butter nice and soft on the table without going rancid . 
note that in a car in cold weather the cord becomes quite stiff . 
ha it didn t work and i was frustrated . 
cut the top ,  dump it all in ,  and stir . 
it s simple to use and clean and works like a charm . 
i can hear others perfectly and they can hear me perfectly . 
the apple logo also lines up with the circles on the back . 
we have used the salad shooter for years . 
the product was exactly as it was described . 
most of the time everything is good with this ,  works as described . 
the dial gauge read num_num lbs consistently and that was fine by me . 
i own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year . 
i have had cheaper  many ,  many  ones and they always fall apart . 
don t lose that cover though ,  since it is essential for storage . 
it comes with just about every possible kind of attachment you could imagine . 
if you need a bread maker this one would do the job . 
does a great job of protecting the phone . 
the farberware num_extend pan arrived in excellent condition . 
the blades stay sharp and it mixes well also . 
my children got into an argument recently about who inherits the bread buddy . 
this scoop works perfectly and provides uniform portions . 
i never need to use a blow dryer . 
am coming back to buy more for christmas gifts . 
when my battery hit num_num led ,  the charger shut off . 
great sound quality ,  long battery life and great fit . 
received a espresso machine as gift for christmas . 
i asked the manufacturer if you could use this as a bread warmer . 
i then bought theplantronics discovery num_num bluetooth earpiece  cerise   retail packaging  . 
its great deal for the price and replace my original phone usb cable . 
it is worth eight or even nine dollars . 
this color is great to add to your collection . 
the volume controls are conveniently located on the side of the device . 
it seems well built and provides a threaded tripod mount . 
great for accurate measuring and can micro wave without worry . 
the mouth is wide enough to get in to clean easily . 
this is much less messy than pouring oil from a bottle . 
i bought this to go with the accompanying dish drainer . 
this model is fairly heavy ,  and the wires are substantial . 
i got this cleaner today and couldn t wait to use it . 
the price was great so it s no big deal to me . 
use these bags they are great for beginners and experienced alike . 
i asked if the sound was good for my old ears . 
i just need to learn how to place them on better . 
also ,  the grinder is mostly plastic but is very sturdy . 
i just can t get enough of these headsets . 
the dock works with both the razr and the razr maxx . 
these are great for using on your opened jars . 
they work fine however ,  and the splash shield does it s job . 
pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster . 
they are light ,  compact and offer great sound . 
so you can imagine that wired headphones can get annoying really quickly . 
faster than i ever imagined and it s great at toasting everything . 
i just got it and i am using it already . 
the size is perfect ,  not too heavy or too big to handle . 
it was terrible  read my review on that one  . 
these work great and the price was much lower than local . 
i am using it with iphone num_extend and num_extend
if you love popcorn ,  this is the popper to buy . 
it s lovely and most of the folds popped out from the dryer . 
you can control how dark you want it . 
turns out this cake lifter is excellent quality and feel . 
i boiled chopped apples  core and skin included  and then strained them . 
it was just as perfect . i highly recommend this excellent machine . 
the style and color will work nicely wit the camper themes . 
i actually may buy a few more just for the price lol . 
i replaced an older cup of this type with the new model . 
this is a quality car charger for the iphone num_extend
i m not really sure what it s made of . 
getting air to the kids  bedroom is tough . 
several of them are multiple years old and have all held up well . 
if you need only a short cord ,  this is a great choice . 
this is a huge pressure cooker but solidly made and dependable . 
use these to hang my christmas wreaths outdoors on the house windows . 
slow ,  and accurate ,  and it will never fail you . 
nice smooth finish and a perfect size for home use . 
this platter is a welcome addition to your winter frost set . 
it s useful for facetime chats and as an extra battery charger . 
because of the pad ,  i took off one star . 
thats what this product makes me say when i use it . 
so i got the juicer and it is ok . 
easy to put together and the wood and parts are quality products . 
overall ,  very impressed with everything this pan can handle . 
i use this for making cupcakes ,  cookies ,  etc all perfectly uniform . 
pretty excited about how well this little phone case works . 
it looks nice too ,  which is a bonus . 
the fit is perfect and protects my phone . 
it also has not clogged like some dispensers have in the past . 
has a stainless basket and trivet inside and cooks beautifully . 
i loved this item wished it was in other colors . 
it has really good sound and is supremely easy to use . 
this iphone cover is a good deal for the price . 
the case was great for the iphone num_extend
so might as well put that slot to good use . 
i received this phone as a huge surprise on christmas eve . 
it fits the phone right and it really protects my screen . 
we have had a cuisinart coffeemaker before that we finally wore out . 
if you like thicker cookies ,  use only vegetable shortening . 
this protector is ultra clear but an ultra fingerprint magnet . 
the num_extend is more like a turbocharged treo or blackberry . 
i tried a different case that was a little loose . 
it works better than anything else i ve tried . 
this case will help you feel a ease . 
i bought it for my friend and she loves it . 
the large pocket on the side is handy . 
it cuts the sim card into exactly required size and it works excellent . 
it gets hot and can burn you if you re not paying attention . 
i had another one ,  and it did the same thing . 
try not to drop it though ,  it might break . 
in all other aspects ,  this is a fantastic mount . 
works great !  my phone stays at  charged  once the battery reached %
it even has a foil cutter built in on the side . 
i m sure i use one or the other at least every day . 
these are effective at keeping our automatic espresso machine clean . 
i got this grinder as part of a bundle with a mr . 
if temperature is not critical then you don t need this tool . 
it takes up less space and is a snap to use . 
they only lasted about six months and we had to get new one . 
this is very good quality and easy to remove and clean . 
it doesn t look like the picture ,  it looks better . 
i have a hands free product ,  but my husband did not . 
the new battery was a reasonably priced replace that is work very well . 
out of my expectation !  the picture is delicate and beautiful . 
i m very happy with it for this use . 
i didn t realize this product existed until i started searching on amazon . 
it would be nice if the earhook could fit in the case easily . 
definitely a good product and this item was particularly at a good price . 
she told me that her plantronics bluetooth fell in water but still worked . 
charge it once and forget about it for a month . 
it is still working to this very day . 
i just threw everything in a mixing bowl filled with soapy hot water . 
i wear the headset in my right ear . 
when i am using it moderately ,  it lasts three days . 
i have both cases and couldn t be happier . 
the most wonderful thing about this cooker is the size . 
i believe that this is a common problem with rice cookers ,  though . 
anyway ,  great model ,  and i m glad i own one . 
of course that was at the num_num year olds circus birthday party . 
i ve decided to not use it for that . 
great size for the size of battery you get . 
this is actually a lovely table when assembled . 
i did have to buy a new sim card . 
lasts a long time off the charger ,  a handy little device . 
it seems to me that this is the  facebook phone .   . 
i loved the way it shut itself off after charging . 
basically they hurt !  these ear buds are money . 
the folks who i bought these for love it . 
this works better than most expensive model i bought . 
you can leave it in the sink with water onit . t . 
i ve added a num_extend one  bigger  to have a complete set . 
daily use for months now without a problem . 
i recommend this phone ,  that s why i wrote this review . 
trying again to work around the suctions it stuck perfectly . 
lots of little spills from little hands and no problems . 
a little more work then other soft cases but not difficult . 
your favorite fruit or candy bar and your are in heaven . 
cleaning is easy ,  just a few nooks and crannies that need attention . 
i would highly recommend this springform pan to anyone !  . 
very cool silver and seems to be protective . 
standby time is rated at num_num months   !   . 
other than that i love having these stoppers around . 
if you are looking for an affordable good fan go with this one . 
i m loving it and the quality is great . 
it s finding its way into my cooking routine more and more often . 
this little num_num cup coffee maker is perfect for one or two people . 
pours notably better than the one that came with our bunn maker . 
the blast could be felt num_num feet away . 
it is also very versatile and can be used for many different things . 
first let me say you only get one . 
its not any more a problem that cleaning a french press . 
if you increase your brightness though then you lose the privacy aspect . 
this is used nearly weekly to reheat my leftovers . 
havn t found this case for anywhere close to this price . 
came as expected and it is what i wanted . 
at the mobile store ,  they wanted $ for it . 
much better than other touchscreen gloves as mentioned above . 
this is a cute bt headset that is very lightweight . 
also expect to get a ton of junk mail after ordering from them . 
this bumper was received quickly and works great . 
no wires means no interrupting when performing outdoor activities . 
very reasonably priced !  cannot find these in the stores . 
it is really smooth ,  easy to clean ,  and hold fairly well . 
i love the material and it fits perfectly . 
i m giving it num_num stars instead of num_num because of two num_extend
i just received this for christmas num_num so not sure of the durability . 
then ,  you can always take good quality pictures any time . 
that way i can tell at a glance what is going on . 
this plantronics num_extend is simply the best unit i have ever used . 
if it doesn t malfunction ,  then i ll be satisfied with it . 
my pole is stuck in the ground rather than on the roof . 
i use it several times a day to grind my coffee beans . 
it picks up a lot of dust and cat hair . 
i then installed the protector just like the instructions state . 
but this was linen and stores stuffed toys in a bedroom . 
the best part is the retractable num_extend cord . 
mine have lasted and are still in good shape after all these years . 
apparently there is no electricity getting to the motor assembly . 
this one fits the aerolatte to go case just like the original . 
i remedied that by purchasing a screen protector from invisibleshield . 
i have num_num cast iron skillets and saw these as a suggested item . 
popcorn takes a little longer than my old microwave . 
he loves them and says they are great . 
thanks amazon and irobot for making life just a bit easier for me . 
never had a problem using it ,  and it makes great coffee . 
i d hate to do that regularly as it could break the cables . 
i do like using these allergen filter bags in my hoover canister . 
just received it today and tested it out on our floor and carpet . 
i had one of those electric deep fryers that only did deep frying . 
i filled the other one with all office supply material . 
i will just say ,  handle it like any other baking stone . 
will ruin your knives ,  eventually ,  so then buy new ones . 
at bedtime ,  just drop the tour into this stand . 
two racks of pork ribs fit it perfectly . 
glass is superior to any plastic and stuff just keeps better . 
fits my galaxy s samsung num_extend captivate like a snug glove . 
it is big but that is fine for a four slice model . 
i would concider getting another in a heartbeat . 
this is a great microwave for the money . 
the only down fall to this system is the size . 
bluetooth connectivity has always been a black art . 
we used this to make our own hamburger and couldn t be happier . 
there were no issues pairing and the sound quality was really really good . 
i would definitely recommend this to a friend . 
i refuse to be one of these people . 
i can go on and on about its infinite uses . 
i put this in my iphone num_extend and it worked great . 
i will purchase more to use along with thermos mats in my coolers . 
the colors are nice ,  and the styluses are pretty light in weight . 
i could not find any exactly like i had until i saw these . 
the bottom is thick enough to heat evenly on a gas stove . 
it stays right on my sink because i use it almost every day . 
very easy to install and protect your phone ,  very functional . 
and both my wife and i have no problems using it . 
overall ,  i like the nostalgia popper more than the other air poppers . 
cleaning my old box grater was a real hassle . 
the basic tools that make canning and pressure canning much easier . 
i love that i can stack these and save counter space . 
but apart from that ,  it sautes and cooks very well . 
easy to use and very easy to read . 
it is the perfect size for higher volume cooking . 
love the oxo spoon spatulas and have several of the . 
they both look very nice next to each other and match very well . 
good thermometer and works well  ,  arrived safe and sound in good condition . 
best offer i ve seen and no problem loading into phones . 
i m happy too say i was proven wrong on all counts . 
i ve had mine since early num_num and it s been totally reliable . 
it s quieter and usually produces thicker crema with its nifty pressurized group . 
perfect is not too strong of a word . 
i don t know what i did before i had this . 
i can t really recommend this headset at this time . 
these are made by oxo ,  a really great kitchen utensil company . 
store it in the oven ,  as you will use it frequently . 
i will buy them again and would recommend them . 
this little cooker is my new favorite item in my kitchen . 
this case also comes with a basic screen protector . 
for the price i doubt it can be beaten . 
you cannot hear it over road noise or the radio . 
will buy again if i ever need another . 
my only two complaints is the charger is kind of strange . 
i am also syncing my music with itunes . 
not sure about the long run functionality of it . 
no more burned fingers or dumped pizza on the floor . 
been in touch with amazon to get their links straightened out . 
this does the job and is actually easy to clean . 
i m still looking for a good storage solution for it though . 
no more dirty dishes piling up on my limited counter space . 
the mugs are heavy duty and look good ,  exactly what i expected . 
you have to master the use of these blades and they do work . 
now you can have your pie and eat it too !  . 
they clean up easily and make potato baking simple . 
personally ,  i still prefer a single piece hard case . 
this cable worked great and still works over a year later . 
the phone network connection is the download speed . 
a little while later ,  i received a phone call . 
i wouldn t expect it to survive being stepped on . 
the phones were delivered on time and in in the new condition expected . 
the rubberized tip keeps the stylus from sliding across the screen . 
especially knowing how bad the battery life was in its predecessor the evo num_extend
wow !  all i can say is that it is so easy . 
i m confident that my phone is protected when its on . 
this case stayed bright white after a few years of use . 
the cup handle makes them comfortable to take from the microwave . 
as a voice and text phone ,  it functions quite well . 
great buy for the price ,  and it shipped pretty quick . 
emile henry products are incredible and this one is no exception . 
the battery life is quite long and the reception is very good . 
i have owned this hamilton beach hand mixer for a few years now . 
i had a huawei ascend with battery issues . 
there isn t num_num bad thing that i can say . 
i must admit this is a good product . 
i just constantly don t feel good without one . 
the only down fall is that it is very complicated to get off . 
steve jobs ,  founder of apple ,  who passed away num_extend
this tool does and the cost was reasonable . 
everyone thought that i paid the almost $ for this case . 
one for milk chocolate and one for dark chocolate . 
mounts into the wall and knives stick to it . 
pizza crust was thin ,  crisp and had a tender and chewy crust . 
this is the cappuccino maker to get for long term and daily use . 
its barely noticeable ,  unless you just cant stand it . 
this emeril pan is just the right match for my household . 
it does seem that dough gets stuck in there . 
the filter paper really does a great job removing bitterness from the coffee . 
i bought this because gluten free dough is so hard to work with . 
it has provided me a lot of extra cupboard space which is great . 
for the cost ,  these headphones are pretty good . 
great caps !  i bought these because the metal ones rust . 
it s important to me to store the delicate dishes carefully . 
it surely does extract the dirt and hair . 
i ran some hot water over the top and over the pops themselves . 
other great features on this model are the temperature control and timer . 
as a result ,  iphones are generally far more consistent . 
i ordered several of these to put in my china cabinet . 
i use it when i am wearing something big to be matching . 
none of these gives that impression at all . 
this is a good one and comes at a nice price . 
but as i said this are not major issues . 
even my wife was impressed and that , s saying a mouthful . 
the compact size also fits better in a gadget drawer . 
it also seems to be the perfect weight for me . 
it looks really nice and i love the colors . 
this is a very well made quality product . 
more battery power ,  simpler design for getting the phone in and out . 
it works as intended and it is stylish on top of that . 
in my opinion ,  this bluetooth outperforms many costing much more . 
it just synched and was ready to go . 
i use this to rinse the food in filtered water . 
i have actually had these glasses for about num_num years . 
light weight ,  fits in with my other kitchen tools  in black  . 
i received it yesterday and it was not a disappointment . 
this is a nice product and the shipping was very fast . 
it just work ,  for all of our need . 
and i simply brush it away with my hand and continue . 
it is so easy that even my kids make juice themselves . 
it works great and the size is not that bad after all . 
simple ,  well made and should last a lifetime when used properly . 
i only bought num_num of this size but the wife wants num_num more . 
if you don t mind rubber chicken ,  it s great . 
the num_num inch was a wedding gift ,  bought to fit my husband . 
your handle should stay cool ,  especially when pouring . 
the main benefit to using this product comes when adding toppings . 
the handles are soft ,  and easy to maintain a good grip . 
i have summarized my observations of this product num_extend
but from a percolator ,  coffee is pure heaven . 
definitely recommend to anyone wanting additional protection at a low cost . 
i doubt that anyone complaining about the handle ever thought about that . 
have ground all our own pork ,  beef and other meats since . 
i ve had my bionaire window fan for num_num years and love it . 
no peeling and bubbles that other user have written about . 
you just have to know where to start to pry it off . 
maybe some stones get damaged in shipping ,  causing the reported breakage problems . 
the pan is particularly lovely because it has such a classic design . 
num_extend num_extend and washed it yesterday to use today  jan num_extend num_extend
i m very pleased with my purchase and product quality . 
the most appealing thing about this machine is the easy clean up . 
convenient to have in your car for your iphone . 
can t beat cast iron for cooking darn near everything . 
this would also make a very nice gift for someone who enjoys wine . 
wow !  this is so much nicer than the picture . 
after washing it ,  it gets a few rust spots on it . 
easy to clean and high quality ,  a must have . 
it is such a pretty dish and nice styling !  . 
shun knives are the best in the world ,  no question . 
you can cook at num_num psig or num_num psig . 
heavy weight ?  you are getting over num_num lbs of cookware . 
then i found the mobile freedom and read the reviews . 
the battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly . 
so happy that i bought one for my in laws . 
i found that they all lie flat on a counter . 
just need a knife to finish the job . 
also like the pocket for the instruction book . 
it was so helpful in making the purchase . 
the voice quality is definitely better than average . 
hence ,  i wanted one with a thermal carafe  the braun num_extend
it does fit over a bowl ,  and does the job . 
they are expensive ,  but the feel is incredible . 
i charge my bluetooth headset and my extra battery packs with these chargers . 
definitely a huge help in cooking ,  especially for baking pies . 
i used this while cooking a corned beef brisket in a pot . 
i love the variety of otterboxes amazon gives . 
this is the second presto griddle i ve had . 
the crank really pumps out a lot of pepper with little effort . 
i own the first edition of the extreme headset and loved it . 
i got it today in the mail and put it on . 
we still use it but primarily on the hardwood floors . 
shipped quickly and i was quite excited to get grating . 
and of course afterwards ,  take it apart and clean it . 
works well and the turn around time was good . 
i wear it to the mall and to church . 
as advertised ,  this pot is probably one several planned acquisitions . 
i love the fact that the fat falls into the dish . 
works as described ,  fast shipping and great price . 
but that s an advantage in disguise ,  i d say . 
a great tool !  i would recommend this one !  . 
and here a few comments that may help . 
i clean them with warm water and steel wool . 
it heats up quickly ,  cooks uniformly ,  and cleans up easily . 
these screen protectors come with a cloth for that . 
i replaced our everday flatware with this oneida product . 
in fact ,  i may buy one to have in reserve . 
it truly gives your item that fine powder crush or consistency you desire . 
i always have at least one back up beaker in the cabinet . 
as is ,  you have to open the razr to check this . 
i was led to icipio by reports from my wife and daughter . 
the num_extend works very well ,  charging both my tablet and cell phone . 
my charging adapter works and has for over num_num months now . 
this slow cooker is replacing a num_num year old unit . 
i use this mainly for red bell peppers . 
this pastry scraper is very comfortable to hold . 
i look forward to continuing to purchase their products for years to come . 
i read many reviews and not one that i read mentioned mincing . 
it s not particularly easy to clean ,  but not too bad . 
hands down ,  it is the best garlic press i ve ever owned . 
they agreed to repair it if i paid for shipping to california . 
a must if you have a kitchenaid mixer . 
what a pain to clean !  this one is really nice . 
this wine opener is not as slick as most oxo products i have . 
i found this here on amazon and ordered it . 
unlike others ,  i do not unplug it after each use . 
i got a code from tracfone for an extra num_num minutes . 
a family could probably use a larger pan . 
the bb is much more stable for one hand use . 
i got this for my sis inlaw and she loves them . 
i bought num_num of them to stick on my fridge . 
i bought them as a gift for her and she enjoys them . 
we do everything we can to make the batteries last . 
the best thing about this mixer is the bowl cover . 
i needed a plug for my moto g . 
the screen protector did what it was meant to do . 
you need to take care when removing and replacing the metal lid . 
clean up is so quick and easy and it does about everything . 
the product name is misleading in my opinion . 
this works very well ,  only for a couple months though . 
i have a great chinese cleaver i got in china . 
great for pasta ,  large skillet dishs . wish i had a cover . 
works every time and the coffee gets hot . 
i never use them ,  but prefer to select my own temperature . 
the pack has four blue lights along its front . 
this product arrived on time ,  and in new conditions . 
big readout so it can be read across the room . 
not very often a product that is this good can be found anymore . 
i already rooted the phone and installed costume tom on it . 
i wasn t sure when buying this pan online . 
the connection between the two is very stable . 
once i got zagg i wanted more protection . 
this thing works great but is small so beware . 
the flat bottom makes good contact with the heating element . 
i purchased a new cover for each holiday for my iphone . 
it comes nicely packaged and very professional looking . 
but for the price it does a good job . 
coffee type coffee makers and that takes getting used to . 
i especially like how easy it is to adjust the speaking arm . 
gets into every area of the pan and is so easy to clean . 
the metallic taste was magnified in cold tea and koolaid . 
the phone seems solidly built ,  and the battery life is great . 
it is wonderful to change my faceplates by myself . 
the silicon catches a lot of dust which irritates me sometimes . 
this isn t a big problem if you don t mind tinkering with num_extend
they are screwed on and will eventually need tightening . 
i m looking forward to many years of good cooking with this oven . 
for the price you can t beat these headphones . 
i bought this to go with a skillet for my daughter for christmas . 
the cable was identical ,  but the charger body had different printing . 
the contents run a risk of getting damaged by moisture . 
i bought these headphones multiple times because i often misplaced them . 
however ,  for daily use the num_extend is much better . 
she instructed me on what equipment she needed . 
looks clean ,  has a good feel and very low profile . 
bought these because my daughter wanted a pink case for her new iphone . 
this system is portable ,  reliable ,  and easy to use . 
i recommend it to anyone with this phone . 
she is able to transport cakes much more easily . 
i bought one of these a few weeks ago . 
just be sure you match this accessory to your mixer model number . 
also the area around where the coffee pot num_extend
for my purposes this is better than the one i already own . 
i don t get my other cutting boards out now . 
the bowl is large and also doubles as a serving bowl . 
i dropped my phone numerous times and nothing because of this case . 
the otterbox case for the nokia num_extend is perfect for the phone . 
i have seen cheaper case for more money at computer shows . 
wish i could graft the handle to all my knives . 
it fits great ,  has prevented leaks ,  and i m pleased . 
espeically when i m mixing up a ton of colors . 
but for a single lemon a hardwood reamer is faster . 
strainers are kitchen utensils that one needs at inopportune times . 
had a num_extend before and older phones from nokia . 
it paired by itself in about num_num seconds . 
so the ways to use them are pretty endless . 
i love this product and would recommend to all . 
i was able to scoop rock hard ice cream with very little difficulty . 
all i am looking for is a cup of strong ,  hot coffee . 
works well and does exactly what it s supposed to do . 
what ever was causing the bad taste is being filtered out . 
not true at least at the store i went to . 
i can transfer my phone data to my computer . 
i ve this for several months and use it sparingly . 
at a num_num amp charge capacity ,  it s fast too . 
this item works great with my husband s phone . 
this knife is comfortable in by large hands . 
the finish on the stainless steal is top quality and looks amazing . 
it is what it is and did not cost a fortune . 
it doesn t work when the wine has dried . 
throw in some flour ,  your dough ,  and roll . 
it is sturdy and i have really enjoyed it on my phone . 
they hold my cakes ,  pies ,  cookies securely and with style . 
now that i have one i wonder why i waited this long . 
i have had it installed for a month now with no issues . 
i had an old one i bought years ago and it was wearing . 
we use it for work ,  for communication ,  for entertainment etc . 
reminds me of the college cafeteria ,  back in the day . 
i wish i would have bought it sooner !  . 
sorry amazon . i hope this was helpful to you . 
this is my first pressure cooker ,  and i couldn t be happier . 
i bought the num_num inch skillet after purchasing the quart sauce pan . 
i like it on the strongest setting  there are num_num brew strengh settings  . 
he has a motorola droid num_extend and i have a htc thunderbolt . 
well ,  the product is great and the price was super . 
this screen protector is clear and effective in protecting the screen against scratches . 
and for the cost of it it s still worth it . 
hers has not . minus; not all the colors are as advertised . 
fit my arm perfectly ,  and didnt bother me while i ran . 
my wife and i were looking for a quality small skillet . 
it has worked with no issues or problems . 
i can t put my finger on it ,  but something is off . 
if you are vegetarian this is for you !  . 
yes ,  go phones ,  can be used by those with regular service . 
it works just like it should and i really have no complaints . 
i found this in a catalog ,  then decided to look on amazon . 
a good addition to the set would be a serrated bread knife . 
it was very easy to put on my phone . 
this is a wonderful skillet from lodge that is perfect for two people . 
this is a simple ,  inexpensive and durable solution . 
the battery seems to last a long time ,  depending on the gadget . 
ok rahat ve yanan let sayesinde gece yerini bulmak ok kolay . 
below that layer is a plastic stopper ,  recycling code num_extend
i have wanted a popcorn maker like this for years . 
oxo makes fantastic products for all kitchen needs . 
it goes off by itself conserving precious battery power . 
fits in beautifully with my other serveware with it s classic white color . 
the case is very stable and holds the phone just right . 
it keeps the coffee from spilling in our very packed freezer . 
its very well made and looks really nice . 
i would recommend this product to a friend . 
they obviously have not figured out how to use this product . 
i believe this relates to how much coffee you want . 
the controls are simple too and the new models do take the pods . 
but if you weight the feet somehow i think it should be fine . 
i bought this for two reasons :  the comfort and the clarity . 
the volume controls are easily accessible ,  and work immediately upon adjusting . 
it is larger than i anticipated but a good size . 
it s worth the few dollars to protect your investment . 
i bought this in num_num and still use it everyday . 
those scoops are really only good for mashed potatoes . 
i am soooo glad i went ahead and bought it anyway . 
this is one of the most robust and steady covers on the market . 
it s a bit unwieldy for everyday use like bread slicing . 
it s the right size and spreads the icing very well . 
i love watching guests trying to figure it out . 
this is a much better way to make espresso . 
mixed brown and white or wild rice and brown or white . 
the good thing about white is that it goes with anything . 
be mindful about any laws regarding video in the front seats . 
it holds lots of food as you feed it into the grinder . 
i ve paid for my foodsaver over and over again . 
cracks them real good ,  like a nut cracker should . 
this mug looks very nice and will match my other dishes . 
it my fridge is sits a little uneasy over the grated shelf . 
always wash this cast iron with only water and a good scrub brush . 
this clothesline is solidly constructed and handles a sizable amount of laundry . 
i love this ! i got it on without any bubbles . 
no wonder this knife is so highly rated by cooks illustrated . 
item was received on time in excellent condition . 
i would recomend this product to everyone with an iphone . 
they re easy to use and easy to wash and store . 
i would buy this one again in a heart beat . 
the others don t fit ,  or have the same quality . 
all in all this product will make over num_extend of cheese . 
these are very convenient but do not vacuum seal the jar . 
it provides easy access to all buttons and ports . 
i purchased this item in december num_num from a major department store . 
i have an lg spectrum that has a sturdy case on it . 
they have good weight to them and hold the speakers well . 
can t see at all and it s made to last . 
it is loved or loathed by all who own it . 
was a huge proponent of the blackberry and loved most everything about it . 
looking forward to using them all in the future . 
people always say they look like the ones that at chilis !  . 
all of those bits go into my garden for compost . 
i would never own a smart phone without having excellent protection for it . 
it arrived four days earlier then i expected . 
i cannot believe how this unit can over flow your mug . 
i bought this because my samsung infuse s charging port broke . 
fried chicken is the best in a cast iron skillet !  . 
the repair shop has had this machine longer than i . 
what can i say except that this does exactly what it should . 
with this funnel ,  it is very easy and clean to do . 
it has a nice wood grain pattern without any visible wood porous . 
they hold their charge and are great batteries . 
t for helping me with getting me a replacement . 
wet the bottom side of the cover  all over the num_extend
we have used pressure cookers  pc  for more than num_num years . 
wish i had all of these wonderful things years ago . 
now i am clutter free and everything is within reach . 
the little rings are great for egggs and also small funnel cake . 
a baking stone is essential for the kitchen . 
this pan is heavy ,  beautifully finished and bakes like a dream . 
it is not for those with weak or arthritic hands . 
does an super great job and has paid for itself several times over . 
first ,  there s nothing like stainless steel in the kitchen . 
much better than the acrylic type we had in past . 
i got this for my wifes iphone and she loves the pink color . 
you can warm the wine in the glass num_extend
i have purchased this product before and will purchase them in the future . 
not much to say about this thing except that it s amazing . 
even the anodized finish on the outside looks different . 
this is a well balanced num_num inch knife similar to a chefs knife . 
i am leaving this review because i find them helpful . 
we bought it reconditioned and it is fine . 
my iphone is my work phone ,  so dirt is expected  construction  . 
this is my response to people who say something like that . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
don t try that with the anchor version of this bowl . 
the best part is you can stream music through it . 
except that i m tired of adding words to this review . 
the heating element just completely stopped working today . 
i can use it in my regular oven . 
i measured the capacity of this pan at num_num quarts . 
a shortcut is to multiple the cadr number by num_extend e . g . 
i make a low fat grilled cheese with pam . 
these magnetic mini clips work great for holding light things like paper . 
they certainly clean up easily and look great displayed . 
also would prefer if they nested ,  but i ll live . 
although they are preseasoned ,  i season them again before using them . 
i would highly recommend this and will be getting another . 
tonal quality is fine on the stock stereos in my cars . 
nice and sturdy and a comfortable grip on them . 
the headphones that come with these are pretty much worthless . 
they were easy to put together and are solid . 
the pastry cloth is perfect for rolling out pie crusts . 
i pour that water into a bowl for later use . 
this is all you need when it comes to buying a charger . 
makes it a bit of a pain but not a major issue . 
you can get this shipped nearly immediately from the online apple store . 
then wipe it clean with a microfiber cloth . 
that box was in a bubble wrap envelope . 
almost went for smaller unit ,  but got the num_num cup instead . 
i have been using this for at least num_num months now . 
i m sure it would be fun for kids to watch as well . 
i hand rubbed the oil in rather than using a cloth . 
it doesn t always have this issue but it s frequent enough . 
bought this after my friend showed me this same case . 
well ,  ok ,  its stupid ,  but its kinda cool . 
i have now purchased them in every size they make . 
i m a knife person and like the task of slicing by hand . 
the finish is really mirrored but cleanup is still easy . 
it stays sharp and it is very light and easy to handle . 
who approves decisions like these ?  this could have been a perfect tool . 
it was very easy to install and my wife loves it . 
i applied oil to both sides when the board arrived . 
i purchased this set of cutters to make linzer tarts . 
i ll be picking up others for gifts this year !  . 
i will be traveling soon and this will accompany me on my trip . 
it is so convent to use and the sound quality is amazingly nice . 
i loved how this case looked in my white iphone . 
really sturdy and not to difficult to clean . 
one reviewer complained that the lemon thingy was not dishwasher safe . 
i put it on the back of my desk and my entertainment center . 
i purchased these because of the nice variety and size of the shapes . 
this cover is the good one to keep your phone . 
a great investent for protecting your expensive evo num_extend
it is also lightweight and i can barely felt it . 
i could kick myself for not buying one of these sooner . 
before i bought this bluetooth ,  i had the num_extend
the nonstick surface is still nice with only few light utensil marks . 
i use my original battery as a back up now . 
just put the sim card down all the way and cut . 
the device easily attaches to your bathtub overflow drain and seals it off . 
it s heavy and looks wonderful with the rest of my stainless appliances . 
do yourself a favor and get one of these pans !  . 
most recipes in slow cooker cookbooks are written for num_num to num_num servings . 
i bought these to protect the phone screen . 
the grounds clogged something inside and the unit didn t operate correctly thereafter . 
perhaps part of it has to do with varying degrees of quality control . 
i don t have this problem with jasmine and other premium rices . 
its probably a wave though . one con for the manufactures name . 
i am a huge fan of wooden spoons . 
i put some turkey bacon in it ,  some onion and seasoning . 
it does inflate easily and holds air well . 
i am very impressed with them for doing that . 
i works great ,  looks great ,  and is great !  . 
a full charge from empty takes over num_num hours . 
actually once i finished filling that one ,  i immediately ordered another one . 
there are some really expensive competitors out there . 
the measurements are very easy to read and include metric measurements ,  too . 
it is a great bargain for a glass vacuum pot . 
it broke off a small piece of my aux input . 
the second battery came in handy when the first one died though . 
i use it for many things while cooking . 
it looked so nice i posted photos on amazon ?  . 
these hooks  well the num_extend tape  are amazing . 
needs to be level for digital to work . 
sometimes the batt pack shuts down before the device gets back to % num_extend
i don t find that irritating ,  as one other reviewer mentioned . 
not a dyson but we didn t pay a dyson price ,  either . 
i liked to turn on the stopwatch when i go to sleep . 
still highly recommended especially if you bake a lot !  . 
she has a grey cat and i thought this would be perfect . 
its big enough to fit most meals ,  fish ,  steaks ,  bacon . 
it handles like a mack truck and weighs about the same . 
you know the one with the two guys not just the one guy . 
keys and change in the same pocket ?  nope . 
it was a no brainer to order another . 
can tell how much battery life is num_extend
perfect for the center console in the easy chair . 
the i just pull out the strainer and the water is left behind . 
we tried charging the sanyo unit from household current and usb . 
the handles are comfortable and are very sturdy and well balance . 
this is by far my favorite case for iphones to decorate . 
when you open the lid on the base ,  it shuts off . 
sometimes i just used the frother for my chai lattes . 
ok ,  first of all ,  i do love this vacuum . 
he offered me an exchange with no charge . 
just charge the speakerphone for num_extend hours and turn on unit . 
looks brand new after a wipe down with damp cloth . 
the blender maybe lasted num_num to num_num uses . 
the material is a bit cheap but hey is worth it . 
i purchased these to cover the blades of my global kitchen knives . 
the previous command product we ordered did not adhere to the sign . 
the lid gets hot ,  so you can t just hold it . 
i was coming out with uneven chunks when i was doing it manually . 
just hit the button and it winds up the cord quickly . 
the product is solid ,  it does not feel cheap . 
other than that ,  it functions how it should . 
these are beautiful canisters that fit in my kitchen nicely . 
i have absolutely no problem using my finger or my stylus . 
place on a trivet or good hot pad when on table or counter . 
we can heat many cups of water quickly ,  instead of microwaving them . 
the press has never let any of the coffee grinds through . 
i ve used it a few times to thaw meats ,  too . 
this is so handy ,  i never put it away . 
i think its an important utensil to keep in any kitchen . 
haven t tried it as a gps device yet ,  though . 
cook for num_num to num_num minutes with upper and lower heat turned on . 
it comes with an extra ear hook and earbuds . 
like i said it improved the singal in doors . 
it keeps the small form of the iphone . 
otherwise ,  be prepared to lose a few facial follicles . 
i purchased num_num of these and i will tell you what . 
it came on and off easily so that was nice . 
it fills quite quickly and seems to chill pretty fast ,  too . 
we decided to get this pan to complement the set . 
i use this with great success to line my shallow rectangular baking dish . 
i would really recommend looking at it first instead of the manual . 
would love to see similar prodct for my car also . 
maybe an auto shut off switch would be a good pair with this . 
i bought num_num and i m going to buy num_num more . 
all were clear that it came with no manufacturer s instructions . 
but i ll live with that for the clean rugs . 
so i decided to get the same battery for my galaxy note ii . 
i use it at lunch to measure out portion size for lunch meat . 
i just had my henckles knives sharpened and this knife is sharper . 
all factory functions are able to be accessed easily . 
it was delicious ,  but made too much batter . 
my husband does all the cooking and loves his knives . 
it usually just needs a rinse and it is clean . 
when they were done ,  i put a slice of cheese on top . 
the number of uses for it are incalcuable . 
plus ,  it looks like it will keep a cake fresh . 
all of the cut outs are precise and smooth . 
excellent quality and function ,  even more so in view of reasonable price . 
it fits well ,  and i like the texture and feel of it . 
i want the set to  already  include all the pans i need . 
precision german engineering ,  shaped perfectly for safe ,  fast and easy chopping . 
enter my need for a phone case with card carrying capability . 
i bought it based on the review ratings which were all good . 
most things release from a knife without them . 
i could not get help to access the usb driver from them . 
this was performs just as well as the last one . 
they are the perfect size serving bowl for a small family . 
and easy to store because of size ,  too . 
it really gets stubborn wrinkles out of even thick cotton sheets . 
it is loud but fast and worth it . 
then the next piece would pick up where they left off . 
i wash it in the dishwasher and everything s going well . 
it does a great job removing particles from the water . 
i ve had my cuisinart for about num_num years now . 
why need a laptop when you carry a smartphone . 
this in no way detracts from their beauty or functionality . 
as usual lodge logic proves to be an awesome product . 
i ll recommend it to anyone with neck or shoulder problems . 
this thing is on a completely different level . 
i use it to chop all my veggies preparing for canning or freezing . 
glad to find on amazon after searching local kitchen stores . 
i am glad that i made a good choice . 
other then that it would have been a num_num star . 
to check his blood sugar ,  and the price was right . 
i ve had several and so far this is the best . 
the  power  light is visible but not obtrusive at night like some . 
i was looking for the best knife under $
they keep dust from settling on your favourite clothes . 
i find that it stays hot for about two hours . 
while this is cheaper ,  the gadgetshieldz is a full body shield . 
it is slightly larger than most ,  but extends to about num_num feet . 
typically i have it set to start as i wake up . 
naturally ,  the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates . 
i made some kaiser rolls using the stamp and iloved the results . 
count the number of holes to the top num_extend num_extend
keep it oiled after each use and it will stay beautiful . 
i would recommend to a friend for sure . 
i measure them but its not rocket science . 
works like a champ !  we like to make our own fried veggies . 
nowhere is this more visible than in the realm of gps car navigation . 
now i can make cheap soup with ease . 
it does what it is supposed to do . 
it was a great long lasting coffee maker . 
so i bought this and i m so glad i did . 
works well as a flashlight ,  but not for pictures or videos . 
i ordered this bluetooth based on what i read on the reviews . 
save a little money here and use it on your christmas shopping . 
try doing that with nasty stained melted plastic storage container . 
the first time it was as black as night . 
thus i was confident about the quality of the blades . 
i use this as a back up case . 
i highly recommend this for the serious wok cook . 
item arrived in the condition and at the time time described . 
pizza dough is also very easy and comes out quite good . 
the cutting board is a perfect size and is not too heavy . 
which is very important to me as well . 
a suction cup model may be a better choice . 
i just threw the pan on the barbecue and it did great . 
it locks closed ,  making it easy to store on the shelf . 
good solid construction and it feels good while holding it . 
i put num_num level teaspoonfuls in the zelco basket and let it brew . 
it fits the camera very tightly like a glove . 
when i went on line the replacement was about $
both were stainless and the one i bought is no longer available . 
i won t let my wish list ruin the review though . 
finish under the broiler ,  then let rest for five minutes . 
wash both under running water and let dry . 
this is the best corkscrew we have ever used . 
navigating the menus can get a little tiresome . 
it is easy to use and holds a lot more than i expected . 
they will not come apart unless you take them apart . 
when we need it upstairs ,  it s lightweight and portable . 
there really isn t much more to say than that !  . 
they are both listed as  radiant heaters  but have a different mechanism . 
the only down side is the thickness of the cord . 
considering the materials ,  it certainly could sell for less . 
it takes less than num_num minutes from set up to finish . 
after i figured that out ,  these eargels haven t slipped off once . 
if that trend continues ,  it may be not usable . 
i have not had any issues with it clogging up or anything . 
great for the price ,  but the included usb cord could be better . 
very powerful that charges my iphone at least num_num times . 
it is quiet and does the job efficiently . 
it takes forever and we are looking for another . 
rarely do i get excited about a purchase . 
i cannot believe the low price of this blender . 
i expect that will be my primary use of this pan also . 
i believe that you will like this product . 
if anything changes with my mixer i will definitely update my review . 
happy to give my highest recommendation to these shakers . 
also use in shower for bar of soap . 
i could taste its fear as i stood imposingly over it . 
just attach to the can ,  and there we go . 
you just pump air into the bottle with the lid . 
a backup battery or several backup batteries is a must . 
no complaints at all about the hanging pot rack . 
and so i was very glad to see this available for purchase . 
it has good quality sound and does not cut out . 
it works very well  , just the same as what i think . 
i had never had one of these or even french press coffee . 
like almost everyone else i know ,  i have an iphone . 
sliced it ,  marinated it overnight ,  and set it in the dehydrator . 
the block has a small footprint which was nice in our small kitchen . 
i have to use it for something lightweight like plastic lids and such . 
delivered to me quickly and in fine shape . 
always best to have the right tool for the right job . 
i bumped the rating from num_num stars to three . 
product is solid and performs its functions as expected . 
purpose well served and to me kept away dust . 
if it warps or changes with time ,  i will update post . 
you get a great coffeemaker for a great price . 
many more expensive rust even easier ,  this one is much more resistant . 
it also comes with a charging dock that is very useful . 
their sheet pans are well made and heavy duty . 
the bottom bowels will hold runnier or more liquid items . 
that saves hanging the mat somewhere to dry on its own . 
but for the money ,  it is just perfectly fine . 
this band works well for my droid bionic . 
i m with the overwhelming majority and agree its great !  !  . 
at the price their selling for its worth it . 
it sounds like a lot work but it doesn t take num_num seconds . 
i would highly recommen it to anyone who loves to drink fresh water . 
screen works and do not have any problems using touchscreen . 
now i just see them laying around the bed or the desk . 
it isn t the hard plastic armor that some need . 
i was hesitant to try this knockoff batt case . 
there both plenty powerful and big enough for any home uses . 
the water does not have any odor to it . 
the few complaints aren t enough to make me give up using it . 
so ,  i m happily doing without the brew pause feature . 
as other reviewers have stated ,  they are heavy weight . 
they may eventually rust ,  but they will never rust thru . 
but use care with it as any seasoning . 
i ve had mine for along time and letters are still on . 
for sandwiches ,  but i use this thing mostly for bacon . 
come back later and you have perfect rice every time . 
my parents had one like this and it lasted for years . 
so no complaints but it it s aluminum lol . 
the power it can draw matches that which my cigarette outlet can output . 
do not expect this to be like a netbook or notebook computer replacement . 
i ll admit i bought this for its looks . 
i was panicked could i find the same stone twice . 
all things considered ,  this is definitely a superior product than the aerocinno . 
underneath ,  make sure to also rinse away the coffee grinds . 
made waffles for grand daughters and they loved em . 
i spent a few hours on amazon reading reviews . 
fits comfortable in pockets and grip is secure . 
bake at num_num degrees for num_num minutes or so . 
i bought a few to tie on christmas packages . 
just beware of the screamin  hot kernels that it can unpop out . 
please be aware when making your purchase  !  . 
if i find anything wrong ,  i will update my review . 
our search has ended with this ,  the perfect grinder . 
and my ironing board is not a brabantia . 
the only place i ve really used bron mandolins is in professional kitchens . 
it has cut my ironing time in half . 
i ve had my assam for num_extend years and use it every day . 
you have to handle the knife in a very careful ,  skillful way . 
the surface is large and they are heavy duty ,  solid construction . 
i have no problems filleting or butterflying with this knife . 
it s a smallish size that is good for omelettes and the like . 
the charger is two sided to charge different types of batteries . 
i d recommend it ,  and obviously would buy it again . 
they retain their shape and they spread the heat evenly . 
i didn t have any issues they went right on . 
i would highly recommend the otterbox to keep your phone safe . 
eggs come out great every time . a few num_extend
i had one rice paddle made of koa wood . 
i have indeed made use of the strainer and juicer . 
this divider is exactly what i was looking for . 
they are great for food prep ,  serving ,  and storing food . 
and also ,  it is really beautiful and easy to use . 
the hard cover only covers the sides and not the top and bottom . 
this is the only one that i recommend . 
it s wider than i thought initially ,  but it works . 
i owned an old classic  romanza  for years . 
found the exact match ,  all these years later . 
i am just used to having a phone on my hip . 
i use an old toothbrush to clean out the crevices it works great . 
really pleased with this product and the company that sent them .

ergonomic and fits nicely in your hand to do almost any job . 
listening to music is an indispensible part of my workout . 
have had it about a month and used it at least num_num times . 
i have had no mechanical problems or leaking problems . 
i bought bamboo clothespins at walmart and they are sturdy and cheap . 
we expect it to last as long as our kitchen aid mixer . 
i found these and i was so happy . 
it s so good that i decided to get a dutch oven . 
so far that has not gotten out of hand . 
although some assembly is required ,  it is simple to get together . 
also , mount vertically per instructions and principles of radio wave physics . 
i love the way you can see the apple emblem on the back . 
haven t had any problems with it so far !  . 
we are very pleased with the foodsaver system . 
the quality is great cant go wrong with otter box . 
the num_num panel shoji screen room divider was a smart choice . 
i cannot review this product due to it not being mine . 
i would buy lids to match if they were offered . 
but seems sturdy and like it will last a long time . 
this one is good stay away from the other . 
i like the sliding power button ,  but others may not . 
there is a large soundstage effect making the sound larger than it is . 
everybody needs a corkscrew ,  this one is top notch . 
and it s so nice not to have to buy paper filters anymore . 
i got this unit to replace my other bluetooth headset . 
did the water test again like it said in the instructions to do . 
 update feb num_extend num_extend still using the unit . 
for me it works well and i m very glad i bought it . 
the manual cheapies are hard to work and i ve gone through about num_extend
she loves it because it just works when you need it to . 
adds no real bulk ,  feels great and looks great . 
this fits perfectly over our older kitchenaid mixer . 
a heavy thick pastry board that is great for my baking . 
very pleased with these cookie sheets and cooling grid . 
it s easy to use and cleans up easily .

this knife is great to use on just about anything . 
the pepper mill can be set for a coarse or fine grind . 
this slow cooker is perfect for personal meals . 
i have several and use them all the time . 
this was confirmed by the certified repair guy .

it is useful for citrus ,  ginger ,  garlic ,  etc . 
not a darn thing wrong with it that i could see . 
this belt case fits good for m droid num_extend
this can opener is still going strong in num_extend
i know it sounds funny ,  but this is a minor flaw . 
and i found it at amazon for a great price . 
the length of the cord long which is nice . 
i have made the coffee bit stronger than i like to do this . 
although i d rather have that than cables that won t work . 
got this for xmas and really love it . 
a couple of strokes should be all that s needed . 
it makes enough for about a full cup of coffee . 
i bought this for a kitchen counter corner where space was wasted . 
easily remedied by taping a dark piece of paper over the display . 
i can foresee having this shelf for many years . 
the price is unbelievable and i am thrilled . 
the case is made of very good material . 
i bought the same one because we had been so happy with it . 
as far as i am concerned ,  this cooker can t be beat . 
i think this product is worth every penny . 
what finally did it for me was the automatic yeast dispenser . 
i needed this size pot for my new induction range . 
just went randomly looking for accessories and came across this and honestly . 
i know a few people who have had the charging port door crack . 
if it is ,  tell me how ?  you can t . 
it is so simple to use and has lasted well . 
i have used it num_extend now with the same results . 
when we returned them ,  the sales lady mentioned  all clad  . 
look forward to using it to mix shakes ,  etc . 
 i think in the newspaper business this is called burying the lead .   . 
only disadvantage is not having in built gps . 
leave it inverted over a bowl in the fridge . 
julian carrots for meatloaf along with peppers and onions . 
it has a great camera that takes wonderful pictures . 
small but they did work will get some more . 
also easily tilts from vertical to horizontal easily . 
the new android phones use up the batteries too fast . 
the only improvement i could suggest is making it a little bigger . 
great product it does exactly what it says it does . 
coffee comes out weak so be sure to add extra when brewing . 
these are ideal and they are very stylish !  . 
just takes a little patience . eat your heart out zagg !   :   . 
this looks like the last time we will be replacing our garlic press . 
i had a plastic pasta spoon for a long time . 
the peanut butter idea sounded good .  .  . don t try it . 
it gets the job done and i highly recommend it !  . 
the coffee really does taste as good as it smells . 
discover num_num minute meals for busy families ! also highly recommended !  . 
i ve already thrown away my electric can opener .

i would recommend for people to get it .

anyone can do it . second the steamvac can handle very hot water .

those tongs have been cute but unpractical for me . 
i like bamboo for all sorts of things !  . 
for the price ,  these mugs would be hard to beat . 
my husband bought me the dyson num_extend as an early christmas gift . 
neither ,  has any of the wood nicked away . 
the replacement filter was in good conditon and in an unopened package . 
it is the perfect size for this use . 
so i went and surprised her with this purple one . 
i also have something against electric can openers . 
i have both sizes and they really vacuum nice and tight . 
she said she should have bought these years ago . 
this cover is the best thing i have found yet . 
you can see oily finger prints but that s about it . 
 drivers had to be removed and reinstalled with newer drivers  . 
i guess my biggest complaint is how the power set button is incorporated . 
i use coconut oil as its a bit better then other frying oils . 
was it as good as fresh brewed ?  absolutely not . 
i use it for loose tea the majority of the time . 
this is exactly what it appears to be . 
note that the num_extend will only transfer  chat  through it s bluetooth . 
dad was not open to replacing them ,  being a link to her . 
this one to date is by far my favorite . 
this has to be the best bluetooth i have owned .

used as recommended without any problems saves time . 
it s a great little machine ,  a bit noisy ,  though . 
like others ,  i agree it is hard to tell head from tail . 
the makers of this need to take basic math . 
i like the simple things and this does exactly what it should . 
make sure it is thoroughly dry when you put it away . 
i also happen to have a thermoplastic polyurethane  tpu  case for my dx .

probably not a got tool to use with ice . 
no more plucking lids out of hot water !  . 
the only disappointment so far has been battery life .

therefore ,  my review is from a bluetooth beginner s standpoint . 
i bought nine more to give as gifts this past christmas . 
perfect combination for use in a vehicle with limited usb outlets . 
i ve cooked with it two or three times already . 
so i bought the seidio battery instead and am much ,  much happier . 
first ,  it needs a backlighted display to make reading easier . 
it was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition . 
i used a little of baby powder but that didn t work . 
i ve also used this to charge my cell phone . 
i love the oxo products and this is no exception .

this is exactly the knife i was looking for . 
i just received these for christmas and i couldn t be happier . 
made the purchase on this item and have used it a lot . 
i have heard some of the high end warings fit the bill . 
this model is powerful and has handled anything i ve thrown at it . 
as i said ,  buy these while you can . 
but my wife loved the case when she used this phone . 
i bought this case back in june num_extend
good reception from a number of bluetooth pieces i ve tried . 
if i ever manage to wear them out i will buy another set . 
i have to problems with this purchase whatsoever . 
its simply the best tasting popcorn i have had . 
she likes the colors and asked for this one in particular . 
works great for any type of chopping ,  pureeing . 
i only gave it four stars because num_extend
the camera is just awful to be honest . 
i highly recommend it for keeping things fair and saving money . 
i must admit this is a good product . 
this case has it s own built in battery . 
i use it a lot for dicing onions . 
i can wear it all day without irritation .

this is my second krups grinder  the first was very old  . 
these were perfect to make chocolate covered oreos . 
it only fits in our larger fry pan . 
the connection is tight and easy to use . 
these are really good addition to my cuisinart processor . 
the grill is a cast aluminum unit that encases the heating element .

i used it to turn several varities of commercial yogurt into cream cheese . 
well ,  don t get them ,  get this one instead . 
i really like these and would purchase again . 
i would highly these jaybirds !  !  hope the batteries last . 
less chance of catching fire on the eye too . 
but i will say that it is pretty good for what it does . 
we can watch tv with the unit nearby . 
i use a wide brim bowl and have no stray missing the bowl . 
the side pockets help keep parts and manuals with the appliances . 
num_num cups of drip coffee ground in num_num mins . 
easy to use just slip it on and you re good to go . 
the epic is a capable slider phone on the sprint network . 
for christmas i baked num_num cookies and received tons of compliments . 
the cable will not seat properly and falls out with the slightest touch . 
this is a great tool that i use every time i cook . 
i bought this and two other colors because they were relatively cheap . 
i think this in about my num_extend or num_extend one . 
i also love the wire tie that came with . 
i can highly recommend this one for its durability . one last thing . 
so don t expect it to cook like they do . 
it is thick which gives me a sense of more protection . 
lets face it ,  most bluetooth headsets arent worth a darn . 
never too bulky ,  has good grip ,  and protects your phone . 
it s also the same exact color as the picture . 
based on the reviews and price ,  i went with this model . 
this cover is keeping my phone clean and clear and scratch free . 
they go in the dishwasher and microwave oven . 
other cookie scoops the batter falls right out . 
they are the perfect tongs to use if you have nonstick cookware !  . 
another piece of fiesta that can serve many purposes . 
the only downfall is that it is not so protective . 
this was a good buy for me ,  i really like this product . 
this product is a great battery case that provides constant charge to my num_extend
great on the stove and great in the oven . 
i used it to charge up my galaxy tab num_extend
this is a great product and performs as advertised . 
the overall cleaning of the machine itself is so easy . 
purchased this battery in the mean time before my upgrade . 
enjoy the bight colors and mostly the safety of the product . 
i liked the fact that i could answer calls simply by saying answer . 
then toss all of your ingredients in starting with the dry ingredients first . 
it charges my phone up to % if completely charged . 
this set made changing the battery on my iphone num_num a breeze . 
you can also use your num_extend as ringtones . 
i ve been using this for several months now and it works great . 
and i love it !  !  !  nothing sticks to this thing . 
comfortable in the ear ,  and so far a good battery life . 
with baking and roasting one needs sufficient space for the heat to circulate . 
i didn t believe the  peeling unnecessary  claim until i tried it out . 
this is my num_extend elago num_extend case that i buy for my iphone num_extend
once charged it stays charged for a long time . 
this little gem is what i have needed for many ,  many years . 
the pans really are nonstick and heat evenly . 
the material s quality is exactly equivalent to what you pay for . 
i think it may actually be a tad faster . 
i got this jar for my husband and his love affair with cookies . 
put in another num_num c plain water and turn on . 
the juicer is stored separately . powerful and quiet motor . 
i just spray it with pam and everything i bake comes out easily . 
i prefer anker screen protectors but seidio makes great stuff . 
it heats fast and the convection baking is terrific . 
so this product worked well at a good price point . 
all that foolishness is gone with the perfect tear design . 
lead is very dangerous for young children even in small amounts . 
its like new even have it for more than a year . 
very well made and can do so much . 
this will be sitting on my desk at work . 
i was pretty convinced of the quality and nice stereo by kinivo . 
i guess i m spoiled after using tfal and berndes . 
great price for num_num screens and amazon prime ! tips for num_extend
i m hoping for longer service with the one from cbus . 
too bad it has gone up so much . 
i recommend not putting them in the dishwasher to keep them working properly . 
none of these capacity stylus are going to do the trick . 
i really like the color coding on these mats . 
your cookies will not get burned on the bottom and bake to perfection . 
wasted my money  too many of those to even count . 
so far i am happy with my purchase  . 
i like this size serving platter for family meals . 
this is a  tourne  knife with a  carving  blade that curves inwardly . 
it fits snuggly on the case and slides easily into his pocket . 
i needed a handle cover for all of my cast iron pans . 
the phone is very light and feels great in hand . 
also ,  be prepared to pay a small fortune for shipping !  . 
away from that point ,  it really is an amazing machine . 
it would be so helpful when shopping for an item like this . 
i am very glad that i purchased this product . 
will not bend under pressure with tough food . 
this attachment certainly cuts the time and efforts down to nothing . 
the speaker has multiple settings ,  and is very loud and crystal clear . 
my phone has been thrown down a flight of stairs and more . 
it pairs up very easily and the battery life is great . 
like other jabra products here is another good bluetooth headset . 
motor provides enough torque to cut through bone joints and tendons . 
this is also very cheap for containers in general but glass awesome !  . 
charges and holds a charge just like the original battery . 
good enough for keeping some coffee at my desk all day . 
it stays connected even if we go inside the house . 
i would give it a higher mark if the battery life was longer . 
just realize if you plan to buy these ,  they are small . 
this is one of the most useful things i ve bought . 
then i decided to give these canister a try . 
it works well for reductions ,  like balsamic vinegar . 
very cheap ,  and good quality for the money . 
i bought this cover a long time ago . 
i have to order directly from jawbone and pay a little more . 
now if you re looking to be creative ,  this could help you . 
i have been using this card for several years . 
they shipped rapidly and arrived in a very short period of time . 
can t beat the price and performs very well . 
i had looked at the options from motorola ,  parrot ,  and blueant . 
its not loose like others ive had in the past . 
i bought this to hang on the wall over my stove . 
they all say ,  its a lifetime piece . it is just alright . 
after reading the reviews i bought three of these and crossed my fingers . 
the build quality on these is really good . 
i hope they have them at the time . definitely order these . 
also easy to get hand in to clean . 
i suggest greasing the rings before pouring anything in them to prevent sticking . 
i was so surprised because my breadman was really loud . 
perhaps it would be easiest to compare this to a  smartfphone  . 
i have already scribed  scratched  the key lines and numbers into the metal . 
i would recommend it to any incredible user . 
it took forever for it to ship tho . 
love the canning pot and the rack that makes jar removal so easy . 
since then there has been no need for the addition of oils . 
it connects easily and was reasonable in price . 
i use it for sweet potatoes ,  apples and bananas ,  and strawberries . 
it s the perfect implement for slicing ,  dicing or chopping . 
it certainly is not flimsy !  easy to clean ,  easy to polish . 
the edge is angled ,  allowing for better compaction when scooping the ingredients . 
with the lid on ,  pork chops and chicken breasts cook easily . 
of course the experience may be different if your iphone is totally dead . 
this is a small easy to use blue tooth . 
amazon is the best place to purchase them ,  for the best price . 
i have tons of le creuset but this is one of the best . 
i do brush it with olive oil before i heat it up . 
this is a great looking and quality pan . 
we often add thinly sliced black mushrooms and ginger . 
this is the typical ,  excellent oxo quality i ve come to expect . 
is not recommended for use by chopping onions . 
would i recommend this seller to a friend ?  yes i would !  . 
the butter balls added a special touch to the dinner table . 
it has a cool design and turns black as the eggs cook . 
i bought these for my fiance but i have used them myself also . 
use it on pill containers or as big a lid as will fit . 
cooks everything evenly and cleans up really easy . 
they actually grip food great and the locking feature is a definite plus . 
my loaves come out of the breadmaker nice and rounded on the top . 
they appear to by much fancier than they are . 
i leave my coffee a little course and it s fine . 
i use this headset on a daily basis and would absolutely recommend it . 
my husband turned the handle while i fed the dough into the roller . 
it was also only about $ so its definitely worth it . 
it gets the job done !  num_num out of num_num for me . 
and ,  the best thing is that it has no chemical smell . 
would purchase this one when ours goes out . 
i read the negative reviews and almost didn t purchase the coffee maker . 
i bought these for my daughters for christmas . 
love the color of the cover easy to put on phone . 
i started using this headset two days ago . 
so ,  i tried to find a way to keep it softer . 
it is also nice for perishables like dried fruit . 
every time now my bread comes out perfect . 
 btw ,  the cup they provide measures num_num oz . 
this product works great ,  does exactly what it states it does . 
bodum please make the cup with thicker glass for clumsy person like me . 
he always attributed it to one variable; freshly ground beans . 
i am so happy to have this item . 
i figured it would dice them at best . 
separate pieces and throw them in the dishwasher to clean . 
there are so many different things to consider when buying something like this . 
a couple reviews said they had theirs fall apart or screws were loose . 
will make a statement when given as a gift filled with summer goodies . 
make sure you buy some kind of leather protectant ,  just in case . 
just used it at the ballpark and at my house . 
the buttons and controls are easy to use and intuitive . 
  .  .  .   i was able to recharge my iphone num_extend and num_extend
except maybe another kensington dual port for your other car . 
but everyone else s reviews about this thing breaking down has me nervous . 
so the universal cell phone cradle antenna serves that purpose much better . 
we keep it in a lower cabinet alongside the baking sheets . 
please note that several of those reviewers have not ever posted another review . 
someone was thinking though when they designed it . 
keeps liquids hot for hours and it s very well made and durable . 
also ,  the plastic container they come in isn t that great . 
small ,  compact  fits easily in a drawer  ,  accurate . 
but otherwise ,  i use it all the time to nuke . 
does a excellent job at both !  sturdy and long . 
i take a press places where other coffee pots aren t practical . 
all the measurements are on the side in us and metric . 
our families menu is made up of % poultry . 
the suction cup is really easy and high quality . 
i get the grind i desire and it is uniform . 
the pot is easy to use and clean up is a breeze . 
now we both feel confident the phone will last . 
and yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom . 
i like the smaller waffles vs the belgian ,  personal choice . 
nonetheless ,  i have still kept using them over all these years . 
i ended up tie strapping it to the triple tree . 
steam cleaning takes the grime right off and soap is not necessary . 
but the option of just buying the head vs . 
looks great on there ,  easy to put on and take off . 
this charge works perfectly fine with my phone and bluetooth device . 
i unplugged it and plugged it back in and voila ,  it worked . 
i ordered this for my mother s new iphone num_extend
got my stylus and i do love the three colors . 
who s to say what will break or not . 
then dry it with paper towels or allow it to air dry . 
load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round . 
i set it for num_num minutes and then just listen for the slowing . 
glad we bought these and the price was very good . 
i like the griddle and do not mind the weight at all . 
i bought this after i broke my phone . 
i guess german engineering is trumped by cheap ,  chinese manufacturing . 
does not interfere with wearing sunglasses like the plantronics does . 
it will locate your phone and display it to you on a map . 
needed new one for my non stick pots . 
i recently decided to get two more units for another cabinet . 
i used super glue to reattach them and they are good as new . 
i think it has been redesigned since num_num or so . 
this works well as a dutch oven and fits my silver bowl holder . 
it s cold out ,  and i want a camp fire . 
i have and old french country kitchen with glass doors .

it is well built and the phone slides right into it really nicely . 
if you have a sharpener of any kind ,  this knife is great . 
wow . i poured myself some water and stuck these babies in . 
these are the first screen protectors that i ve ever bought . 
thermostat seems to run a little hot ,  but no biggie . 
i started off reading the business card sized instructions . 
it also has a num_num year warranty which is really important . 
they are contemporary in design and just the right size . 
can t wait to use it for slicing vebetables and grating cheeses . 
so you can steam clean to your heart s content . 
these work wonderfully for removing the fat from your homemade broths . 
this was an inexpensive case and easy to order . 
there are smaller whisks that get closer to the edges . 
deft recommended !  ! guys will never have to carry a wallet again . 
as some reviewers have noted ,  these are said to be dishwasher safe . 
i would rate it num_num out of num_num if i could . 
this is a solid usb charger with two ports . 
now i just have to pull that out to easily access my things . 
this is the best whisk i ve ever owned . 
perfect fit for my iphone num_num and this case is extremely sturdy . 
she likes the carrying strap as well ,  and the case s flexibility . 
can grind enough coffee for a full pot at one time . 
although one rhinestone did fall off the same day it arrived . 
the phone did stop responding when trying to accomplish several tasks quickly . 
it also works better allowing oatmeal to cool in the device . 
it is something i use almost everyday for most cutting jobs . 
basically ,  it s like this :  you dump in the liquid ingredients . 
it makes it stand out and easy to spot . 
my friend purchased the breadman panini maker a few months ago . 
and it s very very stable to work with . 
this stylus has a roundish bit of something soft and squishy . 
a new blade for this machine is expensive . 
i bought this pot to replace a similar style caphalon pan . 
sound is great except for slight white noise when everything else is silent . 
it s quick ,  convenient ,  and at a fairly good price . 
although i only needed a fryer ,  i selected the presto brand . 
it is cheaply made and it worked just like the x . 
in fact ,  it is rather large; it is nearly impossible to remove . 
it handles all can sizes well and even the small sardine cans too . 
it s black plastic that fits perfectly and leaves all the connections exposed . 
the variable temperature control is a good feature and it works quite well . 
sometimes i even use it to serve tea or lemonade . 
i wanted quality sound at a reasonable price . 
does not peal off like the cheap ones do . 
great way to make popcorn without adding a lot of calories . 
this case fits perfect !  and works really well . 
por el precio que pague creo que lo que adquiri fue excelente . 
the bacon tastes great and the fat consumed is significantly reduced . 
i like this travel model equally as well . 
so i am pleased to say i think these are awesome . 
i couldn t have afforded a top dollar pot . 
i ve had no problems with the first two at all . 
the case fit fine ,  and he liked the color . 
i am num_extend over the years i have got probable about num_num humidifiers . 
another plus is how much less this pan costs than an anodized pan . 
we love our dirt devil vacuum ,  which is about num_num years old . 
works great for people who have a weak signal of cell . 
this peeler is going to make my kitchen lifemuch easier . 
the moshi ivisor screen protector is excellent and very easy to use . 
this is a great timer ,  i love it . 
other than that it is a great savings and durable scale . 
not much to say about replacement rings like this . 
if you can get these on sale ,  then just do it . 
we find using about a teaspoon of olive oil eliminates any boil over . 
now ,  that i have a granddaughter that loves to cook . 
the built quality is top notch and it has excellent battery life . 
the dvp used to come up just short . 
i find that the graduated size is quite useful . 
seems to get passed that you need to spend over $
they are the easiest to use for arthritic hands . 
i got this product to replace my motorola bluetooth headphones . 
if this one breaks i might just buy a percolator . 
after reading reviews ,  i knew this is what i was looking for . 
i refuse to remove a star for that ,  though . 
the numbers are nice and clear and big . 
this is a great ios charger to have at work or for travel . 
i don t understand the negative reviews on this product . 
you will know its worth it once you taste it . 
it does flex a bit as i m tightening the head . 
works great and saves from using paper towels ,  so it saves money . 
don t know it fits num_num cups in it but it works great . 
excellent head set ,  i hear them and they hear me . 
i have yet to create hot juice with this machine . 
use them all the time to sharpen and keep my knives sharp . 
the price here on amazon is the best available anywhere . 
i would recommend this for any droid bionic . 
then mark the time in the book that comes with the steamer . 
i might want to buy smaller one of same brand . 
i just wish it had a better pour spout . 
i received my samsung charger today from the oem shop . 
all in all ,  i am very pleased with the dishes .

i have been disappointed by cell phone cases before . 
i ve tried several different fillings and all have turned out just perfect .

the drawer slides open and close without any issue .

great inexpensive little tool for applying frosting on cupcakes and cakes .

my old one had gotten rusty and broken .

they came in today packaged in nothing more than soft plastic sleeves .

i expect my waring blendor to last the rest of my life . 
works great on our homemade butcher block table .

bought this for my wife ,  she loves it . 
no reason to spend more when you can get it this cheap . 
the last one i have was lost ,  so i bought this one . 
i put it on a num_extend at num_num degrees ,  and walk away . 
laser pointer and led light are a nice num_extend
i used sealer for half gallon mason jars . 
all the dust and dirt is has collected etc . 
i was very pleased with the quick delivery . 
quality seemed adequate for price of the mitt . 
got this for my girlfriend to use at the gym . 
i can blend up tomatoes for a salsa . 
the slots in the knife block were way to small for the knives . 
definately worth the money :  easy to use ,  portable ,  and safe . 
i would not mind it as much if i knew what it was . 
it works very well ,  but i do have one problem with it . 
bottles do make a bit more noise than the cans do . 
works well ,  sturdy and makes it easy to brew coffee . 
wish i could find the large ones here in my city . 
i am not heard by others sometimes as well as i hear them . 
this was a birthday gift to one of my granddaughters . 
with the lids removed they can be used for microwaving . 
i might recommend the black over the white just bcs it looks nicer . 
the use of these pans is limited only by your imagination . 
ours also has a tiny crack after two years . 
and of course ,  butter is kept melted and warm . 
it is small enough to put in your pocket ,  if you want . 
it s not hard to put together or operate . 
it s a better grade of paper ,  leaving no taste in mycoffee . 
let it cool in the oven slowly and naturally to room temperature again . 
these are pretty convenient for any room ,  or even outdoor use . 
i hope this review is helpful to those considering a carpet cleaner . 
i d come into the office and have to plug it in . 
my only real quibble is that i d have preferred another color . 
some have complained about rust but so far so good . 
i am falling in love with this tiny device . 
this is our third and absolutely the best . 
it made me scratch my head why but it works just fine . 
some stores carry others that they saw will work but they don t . 
protects the screen and cant notice all the scratches unless its turned off . 
the product arrived in your typical amazon box . 
i have placed in each of my cars . 
but i think for spices its great too . 
i use these on large bags of pet food and it works great . 
don t forget to order a $ pair of mini tools . 
gave it as a gift and it was liked . 
no need to chase after different parts or worry about stability . 
the handles could also be a little longer . 
fill it up all tge way with filtered water . 
can be used for anything with or without rack . 
very fast pairing  rapidconnect tm  with a nice flip mechanism . 
i imagine i will be using these for years to come . 
they are sturdy and hold up very well during cake slicing . 
if you have sticking you are cooking at too high a temperature . 
it is durable and easy to use and the reception is extremely clear . 
i can t see that you can get much more for $
if and when it wears out i will be buying another !  . 
the juicer also really gets absolutely every drop of juice from the citrus . 
warm up quicker thus heat an area num_extend
you find one that is reliable and you use it to death . 
this slow cooker has been very good for my husband and i . 
the heater totally detaches and the unit is washable .

i would tell someone else about this item . 
i really felt it was too cheap to be good . 
i have raved about this pressure cooker to my family and friends .

you don t want to appear to be cheap .

you can read my review on the product page  . 
build like a tank and great looking case . 
i ve had this awhile but finally it is on our kitchen table . 
the insulation keeps the coffee warm and there is zero plastic . 
also ,  a rounded ,  uncoated ,  copper bowl is mandatory . 
also it has no propellants but still good spray pressure . 
i ve had this exact model for about two years . 
very easy to use compared to other headsets . 
if you have a french press ,  you should have this as well . 
but if you ever have to take it off just throw it away . 
i was surprised at how quickly the clutter ,  and disorder vanished . 
it seems to be a nice quality product . 
my screen has almost no oil from fingerprints . 
the price is about the same as all competitors . 
it easily can be taken on and off . 
bought this to try making my own pasta . 
got this rice cooker to replace my old one of the same brand . 
i m glad it did because this hoover does a much better job . 
i mostly use mine to time my french press . 
i was skeptical but i love it ,  fits great on my phone . 
you can barely notice the cover from the front . 
i had to replace because the measuring lines eventually rubbed off . 
when i bought the num_extend the droidx was the most popular droid . 
they are stacked num_num sets  cases  high and are very stable . 
i received a good number of compliments on it . 
a fresh hot loaf of bread makes the day . 
i think the only downside is after peeling them off . 
it should last a lifetime if you take care of it . 
i double it over to keep it tight on my small forearm . 
i recommend skipping it unless you have a very basic spice collection . 
then i got this matfer thing and it is absolutely incredible . 
so i contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement very quickly . 
but it didn t quite do what coffee does . 
this one appears well made ,  looks good too . 
we have not tried it yet for the french press but will soon . 
the vacuum on the lids keeps even my ground coffee fresh for weeks . 
as with the previous ones they had these do buckle from the heat . 
this will also work to keep bugs from coming in through your windows . 
wide mouths ,  great sealing to keep things fresh . 
some always fall to the counter as you pull the bin out . 
basically ,  we leave them attached to the side of the fridge . 
they each come with their own microfiber cloths ,  too . 
i am a huge fan of these knives . 
it was over $ for a num_extend mah battery . 
this product is not all things for all people . 
they do ring stuff and slide around ring like . 
i cannot believe how much cleaner and fresher tasting this yogurt is . 
this is perfect for cookie sheet size pans . 
not much to say about this battery except it works . 
fits securely to the side of my sink . 
this is a product that belongs in every baker s kitchen . 
i used the tape so the line i painted was straight and pretty . 
i own a dyson vacuum ,  three dogs and three cats . 
well ,  this beauty is one great inexpensive knife . 
i ordered this ear piece since the original one wore out . 
this prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house . 
came in on time well packed with other items i ordered . 
the quality and comfort has exceeded my expectations . 
i am very pleased with this product . thanks a lot . 
i like them enought that i bought a second set . 
i bought this charger because my daughter gave me a palm pre plus . 
it comes out hot that s why they have you using ice . 
tonight i had small ribeye and it was wonderful . 
what is also amazing is how poorly written the instruction booklets are . 
i ve used short and long white and long brown rice . 
this holder is extremely sturdy and very well made . 
couldn t wait for the arrival of this pan . 
works very well ,  if just a little slow . 
i ve had this product for about num_num months now . 
no big deal but it looses a star for that . 
he uses the grinder so he can have fresh espresso each morning . 
i had a pretty easy time grinding meat the num_extend time out . 
i attached it to the inside of my deck railing . 
i love ravioli but never tried to make them till i got this . 
the only part i have ever replaced is the filter basket . 
i think they may be just a little bit bigger capacity . 
this pitcher looks very nice and filters water well . 
i ve had this kettle for a year now . 
i ll order more for friends who have the same issues . 
i am talking about outgoing and incoming ,  clarity and volume . 
the edges do curl ,  but they are good for the price . 
with the free block and steel from amazon you can t go wrong . 
you might take a little less time or more . 
another product that kept producing great tasting coffee . 
i was nervous the cord would be cheap and break easily . 
it takes up little space ,  and stands upright in our broom closet . 
it takes about a second to change over . 
i needed a spare charger for my htc evo shift . 
made a marinade  according to the directions  and used it with sliced sirloin . 
it s cheap and does what it was advertised to do very well . 
this is a good strong pot rack and was easy to install . 
these rubber grips make opening bottles and jars effortless . 
i have to angle the pan a little to get it to fit . 
i followed martha stewart s suggestions for cleaning and drying . 
so ,  i ordered this set of baking pans . 
order was received before the estimated ship date . 
all of the ones i ever bought have anyway . 
these cases are great for the price  which is cheap  . 
we don t cook in them or store food in them . 
this nordicware pan helped get me through it . recommended . 
still the best num_extend headset that i have found to use while running . 
comes with alittle tool to take it off also . 
seems to work well ,  and hasn t failed me since . 
it came second handed ,  and showed in its appearance . 
that said ,  for its purpose ,  this is a perfect fan . 
if you make homemade pizza ,  do yourself a favor and get this . 
if green when being recharged ,  recharge for num_num hour . 
it leaks just a little bit ,  but nothing to complain about . 
all the regular knives ,  soft and hard steel sharpened fine . 
it left a bit of a fatty residue that started smoking . 
i had no reason to like or dislike this . 
i am happy with the purchase and would recommend these headphones . 
i would give this one star now only because the duct tape works . 
i ve also gotten her the pastry bags and decorator tips . 
the cake came out so easily ,  and looks great . 
the dishwasher does not do a very good job . 
i haven t had any problems with this unit . 
this is incredibly easy to remove and clean . 
i can not wait to experiment some more with this . 
i can t believe my mother never had one !  . 
the price is right and delivery was prompt . 
i use kirkland brand soy milk and it works more than great . 
i received the product in record time and perfect shape . 
the coffee maker has three settings ,  light medium and dark . 
i bought this for my elderly mother and she really likes it . 
i use it for many other mixing tasks too . 
i would not purchase it for the heating element only . 
it has been working great for my blackberry curve . 
i bought one of these years ago and have loved it ever since . 
i purchased this to have an extra bowl and it works great . 
i have a num_num sq foot house and three animals . 
brewed very quickly and kept the coffee so very hot . 
it is just the most beautiful piece of cookware that i own . 
i guess you could shred salad .  .  . we just don t . 
alerts when the phone rings ,  battery lasts more than num_num day . 
the vaccuum marinater is num_extend liter and comes with a pump also . 
i bought this one and tried it out upon it s arrival . 
actually ,  you don t even really put it together . 
but i tried this one and loved it . 
this blender is great ,  for my purposes at least . 
if you want simple ,  but lacking power ,  iphone is the way . 
the finish is good ,  the lid is quite nice . 
i bought this to grill indoors in my high rise condo . 
this is the first wusthof knife i ve owned . 
great product ,  lots of power for it s small size . 
i have encountered no problems with this product . 
if it quit working today ,  we would just buy another one . 
to me the biggest negative is no num_extend clock mode . 
i ve always been upset at how expensive apple s iphone accessories are . 
it takes a lot of fruit to make a modest amount of juice . 
even $ is high for a bt headset these days . 
i love how it holds my phone and puts it into vehicle mode . 
until the week i lent it to some relatives . 
i reorganized my entire spice rack using these jars . 
you have to show it off to friends . 
you just need this and an usb cable . 
certainly a fantastic must have product and i think you will love it . 
they are absolutely % correct !  the pan is also nonstick . 
second it needs to stay put when you are cutting . 
whether it s slicing an apple or cutting a sandwich in half . 
they work very well in keeping things organized . 
it arrived on time and i m was satisfied with the product . 
makes it easy to transfer the cut items into a pan or bowl . 
battery works great !  just like the original did . 
for baking ,  this would throw off proper rising or baking time . 
with that said ,  it did an excellent job for us . 
i like it but i wouldn t recommend it . 
the strainer is great too ,  although i haven t needed it yet . 
i have used num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and now this . 
some are way cool ,  while some are kinda silly . 
once you bake and season the wok ,  this residue wont come off . 
i can recommend it . i hope this was helpful to you . 
the touchscreen on this phone is precise and responsive . 
but after that it always works when connected . 
seems to strain the grounds out of coffee better than the farberware did . 
i bought my first set of these about num_num years ago . 
but otherwise it does as advertised ,  stores and protects my headset . 
the spoon is the perfect size ,  as is the handle length . 
it seemed fine to me though ,  based on that limited experience . 
have not yet used it but the cookies are sure to be micro . 
a way to avoid this is to wash by hand . 
the handles are sturdy ,  have nice rubber grips and clear num_extend
so i left the beans in about five min . 
my closet looks mush better now that i found this . 
due to the handles ,  this one will not fit inside my stockpot . 
other people s palettes may be more sensitive and discerning . 
charges fast and works on my cell phones and tablets . 
not a problem here !  good value ,  good product . 
i even purchased one for of each of my children . 
don t try to use the poach egged methods . 
i use this for potatoes ,  veggies ,  fruit ,  even slicing meat . 
this is normal of raw wood which is basically what this is . 
used daily ,  these hold up well and easily clean . 
this popcorn popper couldn t be simpler to use . 
i have purchased num_num of these and do not regret it . 
i make raw cream ice cream twice a week . 
it cleans easily with warm ,  soapy water and cloth . 
cutting and chopping is a breeze with these knives . 
i m guessing all newer moto stuff uses micro usb . 
i am completely satisfied with the product and its delivery . 
this product is invaluable for keeping chips fresh . 
i also ordered the num_num inch round logic press that weighs approx . 
the machine was also a bit heavier than i had anticipated . 
great little cutting board i gave as a gift . 
will continue to buy while i still use this phone . 
fits my iphone num_num just fine ,  with case . 
it slides in a pocket or purse easily . 
had an ipod with a broken ribbon cable . 
i m pretty impressed with my new pyrex storage cook bowl . 
i may charge it every couple of weeks . 
easy to clean out the waste water reservoir . 
really amazing when you see the lack of quality in manufacturing today . 
they go very nicely with the rest of my dishes . 
it looks great even when you have it way over full like me . 
 :  i can tell from the filters ,  that the filter works . 
so ,  it couldn t be a better lunch box for him . 
i really like making brownies with this bowl . 
i make a lot of popcorn with this popper . 
a garbage can well worth the price and the num_num starts . 
i am a fan of kuhn rikon products . 
she loves it and uses it a lot . 
the water drips at a consistent speed giving a good extraction num_extend
charges both my iphone num_num and num_extend ipod classic num_extend generation  . 
i could hear people talk to me as i walked . 
we bought the whole set of three units . we recommend these . 
i ve seen other brands ,  but will stick with a winner . 
and the cooking times are based on the larger size . 
this is the most important thing ,  right ?  at least for me . 
the hunter num_num appears to have decent build quality . 
after a month of use ,  this thing is great . 
it is basically as wide as it is tall . 
i had been in the market for another bluetooth unit but . 
one lasted a year ,  the other i still have . 
for example ,  avoid using a num_extend coax cable for a num_extend run . 
case should be more rubbery to prevent sliding . 
then you run the blade along the stone in the pattern indicated . 
for the money i think it s a great value . 
this thing slices an entire pineapple into perfect slices in about num_num seconds . 
finally someone designed a good machine at a reasonable price . 
i could not decide whether to give num_num or num_num stars . 
if this kills your battery ,  you need a new battery !  . 
works well to drain the liquid from tuna . 
even faster than a gas grill to heat up . 
i have been using this set since num_extend and i love it . 
and now your done !  how simple is that ?  !  . 
i had my doubts but now i m a believer !  . 
tracfone has been a perfect phone for this level of use . 
so far no clogging but i have only had this a short time . 
rubber inserts in the handles for a good grip . 
i am very happy and satisfied with this and would certainly recommend it . 
great product ,  cuisinart has never let me down !  . 
love the inexpensive price and seemingly good build quality of this headset . 
this stand mixer has never given me a day of trouble . 
grocery store popcorn left a lot more hulls and half popped corn . 
i put it in my dishwasher and it still looks perfect . 
the butterflies are hard to see ,  but it is ok . 
i think the bowl is a good size . 
i d recommend this to anyone you ll be very satisfied . 
no need for added sodium from those spices . 
even my husband likes them and he tends to be picky . 
there is no seal ,  but i didn t expect there to be . 
they are not sharp as other reviews have stated . 
makes just the right amount for a single serving or two . 
anything that effectively organizes your materials pays for itself . 
the food i ve cooked using it comes out appropriately done . 
shipping was fast and they were well packaged . 
it replaced the snap open knife sheaths that i was using . 
i ve used used this several times  mostly scrambled eggs  and love it . 
not even when i had it professionally cleaned . 
the adhesive is very strong and just the right size for most jobs . 
cord works well and doesn t add charge time . 
it fits everything from my itouch to my galaxy siii . 
which i thought i would get used to but i didnt . 
i plan on using these for a very long time !  . 
there is an indicator to show you how much battery life you have . 
best stone i ve ever used . frozen pizza comes out perfect . 
so far ,  loaf has fallen out of pan free of paddle . 
as long as you can handle this you will be happy . 
its not cut out perfectly but honestly ,  it doesnt have to be . 
we have also baked pasta dishes in the oven . 
it is the best and i have num_extend
this is a perfect for skimming foam from stocks . 
this makes working out ,  running or walking a breeze . 
global is a leader in the area of professional quality knives . 
i use it all the time with my samsung galaxy tab num_extend
my six year old gevalia coffee maker was circling the drain for awhile . 
makes very smooth smoothies and marguaritas in seconds . 
the cookie cutter set arrived quickly and then worked well . 
the folding kickstand is plastic and can pop off easily . 
each holiday season i chop lots of walnuts for cookie recipes . 
it makes one shot of delicious espresso ,  perfect for my morning americano . 
the handle conducts heat so a pot holder is required . 
nice charger and you cannot go wrong with motorola . 
perhaps we ve had it about a year now . 
i iron my clothes while sitting on the floor . 
i saw this on so many reviews that i began to think twice . 
saw this in cook s illustrated and got one here . 
so it takes literally num_num seconds to put the strip on the pan . 
it works perfectly in just a few seconds . 
this make cooking and eating eggs a lot easier . 
it paired easily and quickly with my samsung galaxy siii phone . 
we love our new electric perculator coffee pot . 
follow the directions and insert battery correctly and you will have no problems . 
there is no vent hole in the lid like lots of other pans . 
you just have to twist it until it sits in place . 
i don t even think that she owns a kettle any longer . 
it is easy to use and easy to clean . 
kudos to oxo for this much needed num_extend
no warping ,  no splitting and i still use this board daily . 
good but it could have been made a little bigger in dia . 
i d be equally happy if it were made in usa though . 
i would recommend this product if you like making your own rolls . 
it will give my phone a good probably % more charge or so . 
i have the num_num cup version of this exact same press at home . 
seems like a great deal to me at this price . 
i cannot say that for every cell phone i ve ever owned . 
but there are few that are more reasonably priced . 
a helper handle to assist with straining would certainly be a nice addition . 
yes ,  it s a little noisier than some folks will like . 
i really don t like the wire hanging all over . 
i ve only owned one pressure cooker that was a monster for canning . 
the cable and the connectors are excellent too . 
maybe now i d feel good about purchasing a cappacino machine !  . 
finally ,  i upgraded and am very glad i did . 
i have alway purchase zagg products because they are alway replacable . 
i like the look of my phone much better in this case . 
it adds a live audio function that for me is a deal maker . 
we bought this as a christmas gift for relatives . 
it does the jobs without frills and cleans up great . 
i have not experience the scale shutting down too soon . 
it came with a holder to hold this case in an clip on . 
my husband got this as a gift from one of our sons . 
using a cone filter makes cleanup a breeze as well . 
i own the samsung galaxy note num_extend and it works great . 
i would recommend this line to anyone looking for good ,  durable cookware . 
but i don t think any of them do that . 
i use these for heating things up in the microwave and oven also . 
yes ,  it does fit the boost mobile version . 
great sim card and great customer service from amazon . 
i arrive before the scheduled date ,  excellent prioducto . 
for the price ,  i did not expect much . 
it still isn t right but it works fine . 
plenty of time to get that second cup . 
also ,  the wire was always just sitting around my car . 
the only change i d make is a slight one . 
all buttons and openings line up just as they should . 
this thing works very well ,  it has a very powerful extractor . 
feels like overkill for on pizza at a time ,  but very effective . 
this is the exact item sold by sprint for num_num times the price . 
it tells you that in the product directions . 
everything i had heard about this sweeper was positive . 
i bought orville popcorn from costco and it makes alot of popcorn too . 
it is about $ and well worth every penny . 
looks and feels like it will last a lifetime . 
i had one under one of my bathroom sink for years . 
these pans are heavy ,  well made with riveted handles . 
i still think it works just fine just a slight cosmectic blemish . 
you still have to plug in the phone . 
identical to the part that came with the mixer . 
this spatula is sturdy and does the job  icing chocolate cakes  very well . 
especially if you just apply a small amount of pressure on the ears . 
until i got it ,  i had no idea i needed it !  . 
the blade will do the slicing work for you . 
the price is amazing though as compared to most other sellers . 
with my morphie case ,  the front part of the case felt flimsily . 
also for the price this simple but working dock can t be beat . 
its so cute and sturdy compared to most covers i buy . 
this attachment does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
they are heavy duty and easy to clean . 
it did a great job organizing my spices . 
well built and a good balance between being too thin and too thick . 
of those ,  three lids did not operate properly . 
so i personally would not worry overmuch about accuracy . 
so far it makes me feel like it is a high end luxury . 
you don t have to buy that $ device . 
we ordered this for loose tea and herbs for tea . 
it only takes a few minutes and is so worth the time . 
just received a call from her re the charger . 
i ve yet to hit a bum recipe in the book . 
also ,  i love skype ,  this is one of my favorite tools . 
keep in mind you press down on the top .

i plug it into one place n leave it there . 
i bought this for my mom ,  and she loves it . 
whether that will bother you depends on you .

i couldnt see spending the money on a dyson . 
this is a cheap product and it does the job .

i don t now if it s the phone or the battery . 
i have one in each of my commuter bags . 
screen is the most important part to protect . 
i then use the mixer to make the meatballs . 
 variable  speed based only on how you firm you hold the button . 
doesn t fall off as i feared but great . 
i bought this machine after having previous problems with a breadman . 
has num_num usb ports so you can charge num_num devices at once . 
the low speed ,  to me ,  is very acceptable . 
we bake often ,  and have always shaped cookies by hand . 
i have small hands and wish the handle was narrower but i manage . 
works ,  is the last case i have out of the three bought . 
after being disappointed with  chunky handle  peelers ,  this was a pleasant surprise . 
this spatula is a solid one that works well in cooking things . 
a joy to use . i hope this was helpful to you . 
i really love it ,  and recommend it highly . 
my husband was amazed at this little inexpensive tool . 
really functional ,  and small enough that it fits into a kitchen drawer . 
i have all the oxo kitchen utensils in the same drawer . 
if you want the best bluetooth headphones to exercise with buy these . 
there is a reason you see so many people with this case . 
once the handset is paired you can use it a multitude of ways . 
being of wmf quality ,  i expect it to last a lifetime . 
i just got this a few days ago and so far no complaints . 
so easy to store upright in minimal space . 
cook and additional num_num to num_num seconds if num_extend
i m very happy with the jabra easygo and highly recommend it . 
the connection to the headset broke within a week of ownership . 
highly recommended for road warriors looking to simplify and consolidate . 
it s not the highest quality  thin plastic  but works just fine . 
and believe me ,  it s an eccentric little beast . 
the price was just right for this item . 
i get a solid num_num hours out of both good batteries . 
it is something i recommend if you have the black iphone not white . 
i would recommend it to people that wanted a cheap case . 
take care to not get water inside the phone . 
i never cook bacon because the sugary substance in bacon becomes very sticky . 
this is one of the highest quality knives i ve ever owned . 
now back to my case of pinot noir . 
the space bar is in an odd location on the right . 
this carpet cleaner is perfect for what i was looking for . 
kinda the purpose of it ,  eh ?  it works really well .

very sturdy build ,  no issues with device ,  works as described . 
she used it a few times and like it okay . 
i find myself using this pan more and more . 
well ,  i have to admit this charger is perfect . 
the apple phone was for my husband for christmas . 
the stand is the centerpiece here ,  and it is very well designed . 
they won t last long and is why i took off a star . 
today the earpiece separated from the body completely just hanging by the cables . 
this charger works perfect and its a nice thing to have . 
this is probably one of the most interesting tools i have ever bought . 
i replaced it with an eros and what a mistake that was . 
i use it in the fall and it fits in my belt clip . 
the big stack of bonus bags is a big plus !  . 
some assembly required ,  but appears to be a quality product . 
was pleased with prompt delivery and obvious good quality of the product . 
this steamer is really letting me have fun with the boring chore . 
i can now charge my phone and my bluetooth at the same time .

i don t want to repeat what has already been said by others . 
these measuring cups are solid ,  heavy stainless steel . 
the flashlight has always turned on and off . 
it seems to protect the phone very well from daily abuse . 
i am very pleased with this little fan . 
it cleans well ,  functions quite well and is good quality .

when i bought the note num_extend i wanted the same kind of pouch . 
others prefer the ease and speed of the japanese knives .

only use just over the amount of water you want ,  measure first . 
install was a breeze and the fit is perfect . 
recommended for anyone looking for a replacement battery . 
i like cleaning blender jars on the blender . 
has an attractive ,  nice finish plus feels good in your hand . 
the crystals do not appear as though they will fall out easily . 
they are plenty thin and probably speed the drying process .

easy to use and the price is right . 
i put one on my phone ,  my husbands ,  and my daughters . 
the sound quality is very good and they have a very full sound . 
received this thermos as a replacement of an old one . 
bought this to avoid the chemicals that coat all microwave popcorn bags . 
it is a little sturdier than some of the others . 
i only need one charger to charge all of my electronic devices .

this is the best utensil that i have in my kitchen . 
i purchased this item ,  and just love it . 
i planted popcorn in my garden but it is not ready to pop .

on the pot rim itself is an indented pourer . 
watching the cats nibble at the bread crumbs ?  sorta fun .

the combination of sizes are very affordable in this set . 
i purchased this press to take camping ,  not for everyday use . 
two for myself and one for a gift for some one else .

remove the pot from the burner immediately after the timer goes off . 
i use them constantly ,  and they still look great num_num years later . 
this melon baller really is easy to grip . 
i have given this particular unit as a gift to family members . 
can t wait for summer to have fresh veggies . 
take good care of it and it ll last several generations .

the filter really does keep the odor from my kitchen . 
i have made num_num bundt cakes and used this shaker . 
bought mine refurbished for around $ with shipping . 
it comes with all the tools you need . 
huge thumbs great vendor . easy to use and pair . 
i believe i have already reviewed this item also . 
its a large size being num_num inches across . 
parmesan cheese ,  zesting of citrus rinds ,  any grating need satisfied . 
i ordered the wrong one and had to return it . 
the board tended to have a  mushy  feel when pressing down hard . 
that thing is still going after num_extend years . 
all of them are made of stainless steel and they serve their purpose . 
i think it may get easier after more use . 
whoa update . please note my star rating was for a $ buy . 
i already own another case that i was using mostly for good protection . 
however ,  they are sturdy and easy to fit in it . 
if i need anything else i will definitely come back !  . 
the lid can also be locked ,  of course . 
it all goes through and comes out very fine and consistent . 
it goes on easily and looks great on the counter . 
not meant for some types of items one might juice . 
ordered this second bowl as a christmas present for the missus . 
this is my only complaint about the product . 
this is one of the best insulated bottles that i have ever owned . 
it washes nice and looks great on my counter . 
the blender is no louder than other weaker blenders i ve used . 
i really had no complaints with this product . 
these are worth the money and very high quality . 
which completely undermines all the advantages of having a wireless headset . 
the earphones come with different earbud sizes to fit multiple types of ears . 
as a plus ,  i now have a zester . 
i was pleasantly surprised at just how much this space saver holds . 
i swap them every night so they get rotated around . 
great on cheeses ,  haven t tried it on anything else . 
it s even been great for helping out with big batches of tamales . 
its great blade and handle makes for fast peeling jobs . 
a lot of the reviews have concerns with how to clean this product . 
i am almost looking forward to ironing again . 
and now i can say nothing more than a num_extend will do . 
and it takes very little space  small footprint  . 
keeps your nice new sink or older sink in good condition . 
the dial gauge is no problem ,  just takes a little adjustment . 
i can make as little as i want or num_num cups . 
the belt went on my vacuum without issues . 
i really like it ,  and it produces round donuts . 
i didnt know tht so i was very happy about that . 
keeps me from having long loose cables dangling around . 
very heavy bases ,  good friction fit on the adjusters . 
the knives can be used without the electric too . 
they are plastic so very light  :   idk what the fuss is about . 
these spice jars are the right size and shape . 
french press is an artistic love affair with your coffee beans . 
i find this pan very useful ,  cleans up pretty easily . 
it goes away after a few days of usage . 
this fits in my samsung mesmerize with no issues . 
pour egg in pan cook for num_num seconds . 
pairing it with my iphone was a snap . 
none have stood up to abuse like the skinomi . 
they don t fall out of your ears when working out or running . 
it was a replacement for one i wore out and was a gift . 
i think that s just me getting it lined up right . 
pyrex products are your best friends in the kitchen . 
i bought this item for my dad s birthday a week ago . 
my other bowl did not have a handle . 
being able to remove the pot makes cleaning so easy . 
for liquids ,  it s truly the best in its class . 
but it has been a few months and still works great . 
i was happy to see that i had five instead of num_extend
i see that there is a complaint about cleaning the strainer . 
bottom line ,  for $ it works really well . 
pretty much the program only works on palm and ms mobile platforms . 
with a little care ,  this pan should last a long long time . 
setting up the fm transmitter to work was trivially easy . 
when i want to turn it off ,  i simply close it . 
the price is excellent . the delivery was fast which i definitely appreciate . 
this case is sleek and stylish but will surely not last that long . 
the extra pockets are a nice touch too . 
this color looks great against my white iphone . 
they are loud and clear ,  but lack the bass i d like . 
if the device is attached and working and num_extend
but all and all is good product and does a good job . 
i was glad to see that it warms up quickly . 
perfect depth ,  excellent cake surface ,  and wonderful heat distribution . 
and then another one for all my beer brewing supplies . 
my fiance ,  who is a chef ,  is afraid to use it . 
this equates to a cooler charge temperature and likely longer battery life . 
i have never found a flaw in corelle dishes . 
so ,  i ordered these spoons and i m happy i did . 
i keep one in my car ,  one for travel . 
that s why it gets num_num stars from me instead of num_extend
not even mention about  life time warranty  from cuisine art . 
have had this machine for quite awhile now and it s working flawlessly . 
purchasing one or more of these cables easily solves both of those problems . 
they compare hundreds of products and this was their recommendation for knives . 
case is a nice red color and seems to be good construction . 
the large diameter and tall sides let you cook large quantities of food . 
it was shipped super fast and was packed extremely well . 
i hardly ever use a blender because this works for everything . 
firstly ,  this is not an amplifier  as an amplifier is frequently defined  . 
definitely get this set and not the others . 
the machine does the job of  babysitting  your yogurt till it s done . 
the pasta roller and cutter exceeded my expectations . 
there is a big difference between sharpening and honing . 
i ve washed them in the dishwasher with no problem . 
i am so thankful i can get my filters here at amazon . 
i would recomend this can opener to all . 
this product works perfectly and charges both my iphone and ipad quickly . 
some cases have a tendancy to obtruct phone chargers . 
i chose this model because it was less bulky than others . 
i ve had this case for over a year . 
the space for the iron is perfect for my larger than normal iron . 
i ordered several of these and gave as gifts . 
moves easily on shower rod ,  nice color and style . 
her replacement is scratched ,  but it does work . 
this scale is accurate and gives consistent readings . 
this rice cooker is awesome and makes really fabulous rice . 
the hose itself is still ok and the rest still works fine . 
the handle is comfortable ,  and the lid fits well . 
i also love the fact that this pan can last several lifetimes . 
the surface is just right ,  not to ruff ,  not to smooth . 
i am quite pleased with the quality of both of them . 
it just takes a very long time to bring it up to temperature . 
it is a very attractive case and not bulky at all . 
but once we did ,  we have really enjoyed it . 
both sets i got the coffee cup was solid red . 
i ended up buying another case in a different color . 
the material is tan linen which offers privacy but still is casual . 
it was bad my floormate leaked a lot . 
too much money to send back such an inexpensive item . 
well worth the money and the amazon . com price is a savings . 
it s universal and not tied to a specific brand or model . 
they are narrow enough for all our needs . 
this fork is just prefect for all kinds of kitchen jobs . 
does not cover the top and bottom of the phone . 
get this stuff ,  it is amazing on pots ,  skillets and bakewre . 
sei purchased these filters because it s what my coffee maker called for . 
being a coffee addict ,  i ve owned many travel mugs . 
i just did this screen protector replacement after three months constant use . 
it s beautifully built and very sturdy and shiny . 
i bought this phone from amazon three days before thanksgiving . 
but as it is ,  it s perfectly readable to me . 
if it breaks downs i ll just get another one . 
pairing was as easy as simply pushing a button . 
only issue is that it doesn t quite fit my pan . 
this fits ,  though it s not the thinnest thing ever . 
if you are on a budget ,  build your collection slowly . 
i probably wouldn t have purchased this attachment for my new mixer . 
by far this is the simplest and most effective option . 
it looks great ,  very much like a smaller smart phone . 
what can i say ?  just a great solid cast iron pan . 
it is sturdy ,  very protective but not bulky . 
my wife and i have had a few garlic presses in the past . 
it lasts longer than my pos samsung siii with its crappy battery life . 
my phone looks like the one in the photo and the case fits . 
it would make great as a gift and i highly recommend it . 
google search pulled up this is a common issue . 
might have purchased a colored version if i had it to do over . 
i use it in my pickup to listen to my ipod . 
beeps when coffee is ready which i find a very cool feature . 
i buy my spices in num_num ounce bags . 
purchased four of the victorinox knives ,  and love having them . 
just another good reason to buy these headsets . 
could not have gotten a better space saver . 
the service was excellent and i am very happy with everything . 
this is the best wok item we have ever owned . 
i bought as a gift and she couldn t be happier . 
i would recommend one for every kitchen i use it all the time . 
it does of course allow for faster processing of whole vegetables . 
almost a work of art . good value for the price . 
although i may still get a mixer ,  its not important . 
even after washing they still protect from heat . 
i wanted this for a fairly heavy decorative hanging . 
best set i have every owned or used . 
due to the fact we keep it out just wanted a new one . 
it works flawlessly and he is very happy with it . 
my lg phone was very slim and slick . 
my closet looks so much better with everything in its place now . 
my mom said  i should get a smaller size for me  . 
no hiccups ,  no distracting apps and widgets to slow down the system . 
i simply do not have any issues with chipping . 
they boil the water quickly and they last a long time . 
htc has done this the past many times before . 
only small measure  comes with unit  is required for great cup of coffee . 
well having a few le creuset this is really another must have . 
this basic set has allowed me to make really delicious pies . 
i have bought this unit for other people as a gift . 
it is possible to put this on with out any bubbles . 
one was two years ago and then again just recently . 
after reading reviews ,  i decided to take a chance on the oster . 
i bought this for my husband ,  and he is very pleased . 
after some thought ,  i decided i still loved the mr . 
i had all the symptoms of the samsung galaxy num_extend  battery drain  problems . 
it was a good price so i bought it . 
it cleans well and is easy to use . 
you position the microphone toward your mouth ,  along your jaw . 
it paired with my samsung vibrant without a hitch . 
it s a hard case and in my favorite color purple . 
she asked me to describe in detail the symptoms of my ailing vitamix . 
i both emailed panasonic and called their service line . 
i think this set will come in very handy . 
i have always wanted cannisters that i could see into . 
quality seemed very good and good heavy product . 
it does come with a right sized bottle brush for cleaning it . 
they slice though steak the way you would expect . 
the method does really give you an excellent cup of coffee every time . 
doesn t get much better than this for storage bowls . 
any one who has a microwave should have one of these . 
thanks to its num_extend processor ,  the phone s capable of many tasks . 
this grinder attachment has enhanced the mixer s usage range greatly . 
so thanks to all of those that wrote recommendations on it . 
the microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including num_extend
i am just trying to get the word count to num_extend
this knife solve the knife handle problem wonderfully . 
the original jawbone was good ,  but this one is better . 
the kit to put this screen protector on was more than i imagined . 
if you use cast iron ,  this really is helpful . 
it is heavy duty ,  beautifully designed ,  and cooks pizza perfectly . 
he grinds about enough for num_num american cups . 
these stands are not as perfect as other reviews imply . 
very durable and the grinds come out perfect each time . 
it is lighter and has even better suction . 
fortunately ,  the easy to assemble and use functions are just as beautiful . 
then i pour boiling water into the pitcher and let the tea steep . 
we have always wanted one and would recommend it . 
and if you have a friend or spouse who loves to cook . 
replace everything ,  then turn it on so that it drys itself . 
these are much sturdier than metal measuring spoons that i own . 
it just rubs me a little wrong that they say unbreakable . 
you begin by adding oil to the bowl in the unit . 
comes out of the dishwasher clean as a whistle . 
my fault for not paying attention to the bowl size . 
ideally i would have bought num_num of these . 
these are very well made and do not have a strong odor . 
my wife has used one for num_num years but it finally gave up . 
will buy from this seller again when i need more filters . 
there s simply not a more heat reactive metal in the world . 
i bought this board along with a wusthof knife set . 
the george foreman num_extend champ grill is an outstanding unit per my daughter . 
other chargers i have had the phone still loses power !  . 
i don t quite understand bad reviews for this product . 
i wanted a larger bowl so i ordered this model . 
all i can say is that i am impressed . 
i like the fact that the lid seals tightly . 
amazon packed these dishes well enough for priceless crystal . 
haven t had any trouble yet and cleaning is easy . 
you can get a great grip on just about anything . 
have had to adjust times for different microwaves . 
then you used the supplied squeegie to push the liquid out from underneath . 
but a side perk to this series is their aesthetic quality . 
and i wish i could use it for longer periods of time . 
it drains well from the spout into a cup . 
sturdy and tough ,  has quart and liter mark lines . 
coffee flavor is very clean and well extracted . 
was expecting something crappy but happy with the results . 
i use it a couple times a week even after num_num years . 
pythonan introduction to coffee ambrosia . it s a quest for flavor . 
look no further ,  this is the product that delivers . 
it fit the phone and it charged with the charger . 
i replaced an old non stick tefal from europe with this . 
i love to fill it with a hearty helping of vegan chili !  . 
the other one i had took two hands . 
no drips of spills in the time i have used it . 
these batteries are the real deal and work well . 
i took a close look at the scars already present . 
if this one wears out ,  we re getting another !  . 
there is only a base plus two small wires to clean . 
simply no fancy packaging and it is the correct one for my phone . 
otherwise i am finally a very happy coffee guy . 
great cover if you dont mind having to open the ipod up . 
audio is clear and it links to my iphone easily . 
i used it many winters until i sold it in a garage sale . 
my only complaint is the cord is very short . 
it seems to charge the devices faster then some of the other chargers . 
makes easy pops and holds the sticks as intended . 
as long as you take care of them ,  they will not rust . 
i can t take it off or put it on without a struggle . 
the other is the charger in an external cigarette lighter socket . 
the juicer also has num_num different size heads . 
we wouldn t have replaced it but this one was so inexpensive . 
shop around and don t be persuaded by design . 
the only down side is the pot must be watched . 
of all the materials ,  wood needs the most to upkeep . 
that came to $ for num_num  plus local tax  . 
having front and back protectors helps in that matter . 
i wasn t looking for a work of art in a percolator . 
it took some time to get the timing right . 
it cuts down on waste and difficulty of opening their packaging . 
i like this dock because it is easy to use . 
i had this bluetooth before and lost it ,  i was so bummed . 
fantastic price for an item i use several times a week . 
it looks great ,  but needs some sort of rim to prevent rattling . 
i personally do not want to replace a bread maker every few years . 
i replaced my old protector with this one and what a breeze . 
it holds a lot more garlic than i used to buy . 
i am using this cable with my samsung galaxy num_extend
it worked like a charm i do recommend it will buy more . 
i like the safety features and the instruction for cleaning . 
my only reason for not giving full stars is because of the motor . 
it all depends on the type of bike you have and the stem . 
purchased for a tomtom and a droid num_extend
these are liquid tight ,  and can go in the microwave and dishwasher . 
i will have to get some square ones of these in the future . 
and the fact that they are almost indestructible . 
this num_extend covered fry pan is of good quality . 
i love scarves and really needed some way to organize or store them . 
i would recommend this purchase atleast for back up . 
a big plus that lodge products are made in the usa . 
i bought this cover when i ordered a new microwave . 
i find myself reaching for this pan way more than my others . 
i also like that you can see how much soap is left . 
easier to deal with than the standard metal caps that are num_num pieces . 
i purchased this charger to use with my motorola moto x phone . 
i love this knife ,  though it feels more like a sword . 
the silicone skin ,  cable ,  and wall charger all work great . 
this is a great phone protector for the samsung galaxy prevail . 
i have switched to a smaller ,  less armored case for mine . 
chicken breasts ,  steaks ,  pork chops etc all work great . 
this is my first electric little chopper and i couldn t be happier . 
two cups in the morning and it keeps them happy . 
easy to grip and doesn t get all greasy . 
i think it is perfect for a busy home kitchen . 
you have to get the unit with the in ear earpiece . 
i love this bread machine and use it several times per month . 
num_extend third pot is about to bite the dust . 
does not work on all cans ,  especially those really num_extend
the innter cooking bowl is little bit thin and filmsy to my standard . 
adds just enough bulk to feel good in the hand . 
now i can change the filters and not worry about running out . 
this machine draws full load as you plug it into the wall . 
this sheath protector product keeps my knife in new condition . 
it takes a great edge  i use a chef s choice asian sharpener  . 
i have a traditional porcelain sink with curvy walls and bottom . 
just the right size for my needs and dishwasher safe . 
i love buying these things by the lot and keeping them on hand . 
not real friendly for high daily use in normal conditions . 
for the price ,  it is hard to beat . 
i love that it came with a cookbook ,  recipes and other information . 
they work wonderfully for grating cheese ,  shredding lettuce ,  and slicing vegetables . 
this turned out to be just what we wanted as a gift . 
it is a small decorative bowl for change ,  mints etc . 
regardless jabra is my favorite and i did not think that was possible . 
they are not bigger than your standard shower rod . 
i use these for both iphones and ipads . 
much larger that the num_extend inch versions that we had been using . 
it is made of cast aluminum and has been around for num_num years . 
but the length of time it stays charged is really awesome . 
when i ordered this ,  i didn t really think about the size . 
it s a working kitchen tool ,  what more can be said ?  . 
defective earpiece design ,  even the  improved earpieces  are no good . 
build quality is great and no problems so far . 
they look like a mini bowl with a handle . 
i don t think that is necessary at all . 
a friend had one of these cups and loved it so i bought num_extend
the price is right and it is a indispensable simple decorating tool . 
just be careful and not touch the bottom of the bowl . 
arrived in a retail package ,  appeared to be genuine nokia . 
the only thing it didn t do well was onions . 
i bought this to match the napkins holders and this is really nice . 
 :  in fact ,  i ve been surprised at how sturdy it is . 
it has more than enough room for making plenty of pasta . 
also works to charge ios devices with correct usb cable . 
i like the idea that it is unbreakable unlike glass measuring cups . 
charger comes with this unit !  a nice num_extend
buy and have fun if you are into this sort of thing !  . 
it works perfectly and helps charge my phone very nicely . 
everything else is great !  i love the bluetooth !  . 
the case fits snug ,  which is great !  !  great product . 
so ,  i m planning on keeping it in my work bag . 
i m going to order more of these as gifts . 
i charge them over night every other day . 
the high polish of this stainless is beautiful . 
they have great sound but i have to hold it in my ear . 
actually think this model hoover does a better job cleaning . 
i had used it for a week before i even read the instructions . 
it has now been six months since i bought this from amazon . 
this may sound confusing ,  but it really is not . 
i use these mixers every week . i also own a :  all num_extend
i tried resetting my network and phone settings ,  no luck . 
although they do not recline ,  they are silent . 
ordered this for my son to give to his wife for christmas . 
they re tiny and frequently not accessible when you need them . 
these little hooks are very sturdy and heavy duty . 
it happens ,  but it can be quickly remedied . 
hopefully it lasts just as good as my other cellet car chargers . 
i fits well on my phone and the color is exactly as shown . 
it s cheap ,  light ,  and the suction is fantastic . 
a must for home canners who have lots of jars in the fridge . 
it was a surprise for my wife and she loved it . 
to get to the screen you require a num_extend and a num_extend screwdrivers . 
i also like that s it s stainless steel as opposed to aluminum . 
this has become one of my favorite kitchen gadgets . 
everything went as expected ,  very easy to do . 
wow ,  a full num_num to num_num hours talk time !  it works . 
got this item sometime ago ,  forgot to write a review . 
but of course i have to charge it up first . 
they didn t hassle me about proof of purchase or anything . 
markings are clear ,  distinct ,  and well laid out . 
i had the model before this and a model before that . 
i ve had these for many months and use them a lot . 
definitely worth the price just to have the wall charger . 
probably should have got this a long time ago . 
i dropped my phone several times and it was not even scratched . 
i used my fry daddy the first day i received it . 
i can t say enough good things about this product . 
he doesn t mind the bulk because it protects his phone . 
the brown rice feature makes amazing barley ,  and beans . 
he also says the sound quality is great . 
i m glad that it lasts from start to end . 
i guess i will start washing by hand and using bleach water . 
hot water in moments ,  and quick to make tea or melitta coffee . 
who doesn t love a good set of pyrex laying around the house . 
got it as a gift and it matches my toaster . 
it rinses clean easily ,  is dishwasher safe ,  and does not rust . 
medium high is the highest i ever go on my induction burner . 
i am getting my mom a set ,  too . 
came right on the day i needed it !  great for gifts . 
i do know these are all i will use . 
the faux leather looks cool and the item overall isn t obtrusive . 
i was surprised by how solidly made these pans feel . 
it s kind of retro and fits well in my num_extend kitchen . 
it is justone of the best values ever . 
this will be the ultimate wedding present from now on . 
you will still be required to lightly grease and flour it . 
we have no negative comments on this machine . 
this is my third purchase of exactly this product . 
it feels a little flimsy but it does the trick . 
knife blocks take up too much counter space and aren t very customizable . 
overall ,  much more than i expected for less than $
the cable is not too long ,  but it gets the job done . 
this is wonderful !  got num_num of them and they both work awesome . 
i am so glad i got this funnel . 
i have one of these already and it s a great handheld . 
tight fit is the only reason for the four stars . 
you need to brew coffee at num_num degrees for num_num minutes . 
i cleaned up the area with the alcohol pad as recommended . 
it does a good job when needed and is light weight and convenient . 
but ,  be patient when you are first setting it up . 
everything but the base can go into the dishwasher . 
i ve noticed it discharges quite fast when left sitting . 
we loved them since we are big coffee drinkers . 
with a price like this i can complain . 
it grinds fast ,  it turns easily ,  and loads easily . 
the capresso conical burr grinder is a fine machine . 
i m seriously considering getting another just as a backup . 
but i really wish it had been a bit better in clarity . 
easy to use ,  rolls in and out will not get tangled . 
i think i ll get a few more of these for christmas gifts . 
hi everyone , i ve always loved the convenience of my lg num_extend
holds my knives and the aforementioned scissors and can opener . 
this is actually num_num reviews in one spot . 
the product was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition . 
this is the num_extend one i have purchased . 
i purchased it knowing it was gonna look awesum on my phone . 
it does exactly what it is designed for . 
this thing takes the wrinkles out of anything in no time flat . 
down side is that it is harder to flip sides using a spatula . 
my seemingly clean carpet filled up the dyson canister !  ewwww . 
i don t think that you ll find a better unit in existence . 
i let that stand for three days to allow the chlorine to evaporate . 
a bit of a pain to clean but worth it . 
i have had this over a year and it is still going strong . 
but  ,  i would not get these dishes if i had teenagers . 
the coffee is head and shoulders above any drip machines . 
i am not sensitive about having the second cup piping hot . 
i got the tablecloth but not the napkins . 
adorable ,  durable ,  and the salt and pepper shakers work great . 
i ll buy the other sizes at some point . 
still does what i need :  grind coffee fast and fine . 
i like them so much i may order more . 
it doesn t get all gunked up ,  which is nice . 
i ve baked a few cheesecakes and they have both come outerfectly . 
used it for the first time today to mix up waffle batter . 
it is incredibly easy to lose those things !  . 
these item was to add to my collection of chargers . 
i had the best time today making fresh pasta . 
i had no problem with the recipes online working in the zoku maker . 
however ,  with the right pan it s incredibly easy . 
this is an awesome car charger for my lg viper . 
i buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops . 
it didn t come off easily with dish soap . 
previous warm air humidifiers we have bought only seemed to last num_num season . 
i was surprised when i got inconsistent signals in my house . 
since it does it s job well it deserves a good star . 
though i have not had any problem with liquid leaking ever . 
it pops on easily and is removed easily . 
i ve been using it for num_num months with no problems at all . 
it probably has seen num_num uses+ by our family in its life . 
it s so nice not having to worry about your phone dying anymore . 
the android device does a wonderful with the gps . 
my original cord split open and i was afraid i d get shocked . 
be careful about that and you will have no issues !  . 
the only notable thing is that i got a different model . 
works very well and makes pie dough rolling easy . 
so far ,  i ve used it to make meatloaf . 
the inside material is soft to prevent scratching of phone surfaces . 
barely holds num_num oz but good and sturdy . 
it charges quickly even while using pandora or gps i have bought num_extend
this enamel coated cast iron dish is durable and attractive . 
when it finally stopped working num_num year running   . 
the price was good ,  and the scale does what i expect . 
i have a verizon white iphone and have not had this problem . 
they were very durable and comfortable to the touch . 
i bought two of them and recommend them to everybody . 
the filter adds to the flavor of the coffee . 
i absolutely love it  :   it is awesome and everything i expected . 
used my own recipe ,  this wouldn t work at all . 
eat your hearts out all you other wives  . 
that s really all it s for and it works perfectly . 
it s a little awkward but i m getting used to it . 
it really does a good job and is fast . 
using that alternating method yielded very evenly sized chopped vegetables . 
it took a little more than two weeks for these to come in . 
i love this rack for cookies that just come out of the oven . 
i like a lot of fresh air for my bedroom . 
the sleek ,  matte style finish is great and looks just as nice . 
it is a stylish accessory but not very useful . 
i forget i m wearing them until i see myself in the mirror . 
at the time ,  i was using the cheapest of the cheap cookware . 
so for that reason ,  i like this case . 
there is no battery that can resist ,  let alone the iphone s . 
the charger is light and feels a little cheap . 
so far i have yet to be disappointed . 
for a guaranteed phone put group is the best place to buy it . 
the bale is sturdy and easily supports the weight of the oven . 
have num_num lasko fans and all work great . 
this is a true bargain in every regard . 
something like pulling a sock off your foot . 
it is large enough to make almost everything . 
i was a little worried ,  but it came out just fine . 
i own one of these and have used it for years .

now people no longer laugh at me for not having a real oven . 
i almost went for the fewer rack version . 
i bought num_num of these on a whim . 
the stainless steel works well with any decor .

worst thing apple has ever done is get rid of this cable .

these glasses are the solution to that problem . 
the outer rubber dose get stretched out a lot quicker . 
what i really just don t care about it is the texture . 
what i like most was it s large capacity . 
this is not the latest or greatest phone ,  but it works well . 
$ for the same model ?  $ shipping ?  whew . 
i ve had this item for nearly two years . 
does not wiggle around or feel loose at all . 
all steel so it can be close if not on the stove top . 
these are hard to find ,  as you may already know . 
super easy to use and super easy to clean !  !  !  . 
bluetooth headsets seem like a much better idea . 
i had an old springform pan than has now been discarded . 
i dont normally buy glasses without looking them over first . 
all i can say  you pay for what you get .   . 
so far i am enjoying this set and it fulfills my need nicely . 
it also seems to be built well and the parts are sturdy . 
i had a smaller than normal drawer and this is a perfect fit . 
it heats up quickly ,  and sustains good steam production . 
however ,  it is the best when you consider  bang for the buck  .

i like this tool for making small meatballs from scratch . 
they were easy to apply and as always a good price . 
i bought it for a friend and he loves it .

i make my own pizzas with whole wheat dough . 
its impossible to find items like this at the local stores nowadays . 
i got these canisters as a wedding present after registering for them . 
looks like the picture which is good ,  no surprises . 
i do however recommend it except in the worst cellular service connection locations . 
yet small enough to fit in our already cramped cabinet . 
i ve been happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others . 
too bad the custom bags are so expensive . 
we also use the broiler for salmon ,  unagi ,  etc . 
the most amazing part is how quiet it is . 
i just had a new counter top installed in my kitchen . 
it is thick enough and made well on the connector end . 
it tastes better than straight tap water too . 
it works ,  but i think that it could work better . 
it will likely pay for itself on its first filter . 
i ve tried others but nothing beats this one . 
for your series num_num num_extend motorola droid slider cell . 
for num_num bucks it s probably the best thing you ll find . 
the reviews are correct ,  it bakes bundt cakes incredibly well . 
it was very heavy and the color is perfect . 
the noshes don t stick and the mat washes up in a snap . 
the next vacuum i get will have to have that . 
too long and the juice may be off flavored . 
i use my bold num_num as my alarm clock . 
many of the lemons were almost too large for it . 
i rented a car with that kind of system and loved it .

well i was suprised !  these are a lot larger then i thought . 
it saves money and a lot of time . 
it is easy to remove and cleans very well . 
it has good battery life and its quick to charge .

i have dropped my phone several times and it has provided adequate protection . 
it has the nice  good grips  handle and is a good length . 
i go through headsets like some people go through socks . 
the one down side is how long the shipping took . 
the buttons on the controller are confusing . very satisfied with the product . 
nice price and it got to my house pretty darn fast . 
i can t rave enough about this rice cooker . 
road warriors with a lot of gear need one of these . 
the holes in which the latches engage are made of relatively flimsy plastic . 
this is a great spatula to use on a non stick surface . 
it comes with two ,  but still shouldn t have broke so quickly . 
it tends to be rather noisy on high . 
this does not create signal where there is none . 
my grandmother had an aluminum pressure cooker years ago that was much heavier . 
did not push up on the screen protector like some other cases will . 
i honestly haven t changed the battery since i installed it . 
you will save money in the long run . 
much ,  much lighter ,  quick ,  easy and works just great . 
this little guy is tiny !  love the retro of it . 
i especially appreciate straight pieces of bacon on my plate . 
very sturdy and makes picking out the right scarve easy . 
this is a great cover for the blackberry . 
the bottom tapers to fit nicely into any car holder .

edit edit edit editlisten to the one star reviews . 
i ve been using this everyday for num_num years and still works great . 
they seem to be much better than my previous blender . 
it could use a center support ,  otherwise perfect .

i have been using it for num_num weeks now . 
there just needs to be some tweeks to the next version .

the pocket for the attachments is great too . 
there are num_num small blue leds on the front face of the device . 
wonderful for stir fry veggies !  for the price . 
i loved this device so much ,  that i purchased num_extend
these come with instructions ,  labels and with num_num sheets of plastic . 
oxo will be getting much more of our business . 
you can really tell that a lot of thought went into the design . 
why blame the phone because you broke the screen . 
this technique can be used to make centerpieces for holidays . 
finally my husband surprised me and just ordered it for me . 
they carry a lifetime warranty and the price is great . 
i don t worry about about breaking it at all . 
it would have shined after the first if i had been more patient . 
you need them ,  so buy them when you buy the stick vac . 
the look is great and they do the job . 
after about num_num minutes my x went from % to %
the sound embodies crisp highs and full lows . 
i wish somehow they could have made the silicone rubber clear . 
the xlink bt bluetooth gateway is extremely easy to use and set up . 
this is a two piece case with a dual color matte finish . 
the kids love finding new recipes for the dutch oven . 
this is the perfect size to do small cakes . 
the concept works if the grooves are wide and wide apart . 
i serve the pizza on the pan still to keep it warm . 
they can be cleaned with a clorox wipe . 
it s a spreader and a knife all in one . 
these are substantial jars and will last a long time . 
wish we would have bought a boat load at that price though . 
it looks awesome but didnt like to stay snapped together . 
oxo designs great products and this is no exception . 
grill works great ,  investing in some disposable aluminum covers though . 
its fiesta so the quality is good and the color is great . 
i purchased the cuisinart saucepans and love them . 
with num_num grind settings ,  i figured i d be set . 
with the help of this cookbook ,  i have made many delicious dishes . 
believe it or not ,  this is my first salad spinner . 
i love this pot and couldn t live without it . 
blends much better then ones costing a great deal more . 
they are acrylic ,  not glass ,  so they can get scratched . 
i would recommend to anyone looking for a medium sized bottle . 
great sound ,  good quality ,  arrived with instruction manuals . 
with time it does come to fit better . 
my phone is connected to the car s bluetooth . 
these fit great ,  and have last a good amount of time . 
i think this is my num_extend set of glass pyrex food storage dishes . 
it shipped from nc ,  drop shipped ,  i assume . 
have a look at the pics if you do not believe me . 
 because we all have a dust free cleanroom ,  right ?   . 
it does seem to work especially well on tile . 
it s such a useful product ,  i can t say enough . 
i purchased this for my mother in law and she loved it . 
helps me make gorgeous cupcakes for friends and family . 
i recommend this to anyone ,  its been very good to me . 
they are the perfect size for mini sweet breads and regular breads . 
my only issue with it is the noise . 
this is one of the handiest items to have in the kitchen . 
i almost lost a glass lid that way ,  but was lucky . 
other than that ,  i really like this popper . 
i change devices frequently and this product has out done itself . 
lastly ,  read the manual entirely before you start . 
for example ,  you can specify during what hours to go fetch email . 
it is an incredibly fine precision tool for chopping ,  dicing ,  etc . 
for when you want to latin bed with it etc . 
i would recommend this case to a friend . 
ordered this on feb num_num and got it on feb num_num num_extend
this really holds everything ,  it s the perfect size . 
i was glad i purchased this one over others . 
i m on my second pair ,  the first ones were lost . 
the size is perfect for my little family of num_extend
retains heat beautifully ,  as it was designed to do . 
only need to make num_num so my hands don t get that sore . 
we just turn it on as we leave for work each morning . 
this one ,  however ,  is going back to amazon for a refund . 
finally ,  too many knife cuts . missed them a lot . 
it fits and defends my iphone through everything i have thrown at it . 
i love le creuset and will buy whenever i can . 
i could go a full day without charging it . 
this scraper is just like the scrapers we used in the num_extend
i cannot see myself using them for longer than num_num minutes without discomfort .

i only wish that the case had an option of colors . 
this vegetable brush is extremely easy to handle ,  too . 
i just wish it worked with a standard bluetooth adapter . 
this pressure cooker arrived about num_num minutes ago . 
i purchased the steamer primarily to clean floor grout . 
these dishes are an excellent value !  they are lightweight and very durable . 
so it s been almost num_num years since i got this . 
the first thing i made was pear ice cream  gourmet magazine  . 
you also hear the annoying beeps every time you change settings . 
very happy with this product ,  its ust what we wanted and ordered . 
this is the best in a long time . 
i won t make that mistake again when using the higher speeds . 
i would prefer it on the motor housing . 
i love that i could buy just the one piece . 
easy to use ,  saves time ,  and produces great fries . 
it is a standard size pretty much handles everything in the kitchen . 
i really like not having a corded headset while running . 
i ordered this product for a friend of mine . 
protects the iphone as any good shell would . 
over all i was very satisfied with the transaction . 
do yourself a favor and get this num_extend
fits the iphone num_extend with bumper case perfectly . 
this little pan is perfect for num_num or num_num burgers or steaks . 
got this one as a replacement for a different brand . 
i ordered this for our rv shelf over the sink in the bathroom . 
the bags can be slippery ,  but easitly stackable or turned sideways . 
the ridges on the back give you a great grip . 
the transaction with amazon was prompt and the product delivered on time . 
great for conditioning or reconditioning wooden cutting boards . 
both are made of stainless steel and are dishwasher safe . 
it doesn t look like you can go wrong with these . 
it s bigger than i expected ,  which is good . 
the metal pans are great at reheating the pizza in the oven . 
we will purchase only this line of nonstick pans for quality and value . 
the num_extend square works really well on my num_extend round table . 
be careful with it and you get a functional product for cheap . 
i love all my wusthof knives ,  but this one is my favorite . 
very solid pan ,  i m sure it will last for many years . 
i like it but don t have use for screen . 
for what you pay ,  it is a very good purchase . 
it paired ,  again almost by itself ,  in about num_num seconds . 
this is still like new and i use it all the time . 
and ,  yes ,  they still have the annoying slight curl . 
awesome .   whatever i ask of this machine ,  it does without complaint . 
my wife and i bought num_num different cases which all have good reviews . 
we are using it on her num_extend gen ipod touch . 
the only downside is the max volume is kind of low . 
item works well but can be extremely dangerous . 
another very well put together product by oxo . 
it gives a clean look and is easy to clean . 
i does jerky in about num_extend if your doing strips on num_num stacks . 
she charges her e cigarates everyday and it charges them with no problems . 
more internet device than phone but i m hooked . 
i wanted a bag that was well made and was a good size . 
i even  fixed  some of my ruined knives with this sharpener . 
once all the cutting is complete i throw it in the dishwasher . 
the material is perfect for greasing and it provides seamless release . 
if you want a certain type of crust ,  use the dough cycle . 
it s a bit thick but not a big deal . 
certainly longer than this case of pinot noir . 
i have two of these and they are easy to use and versatile . 
no overheating or charging loss faster than the original . 
i finally received one for christmas a few years ago . 
these mugs are awesome !  i use them all the time . 
a large egg obviously takes longer to cook than a small one . 
also ,  it s not as dry as those air poppers . 
also they are cheap  compared to most things i buy for the kitchen  . 
easy to use and easy to clean ,  love it !  . 
i researched and read for hours before deciding on this one . 
but ,  the oxo good grips salad spinner was exactly what i wanted . 
good for their price range ,  they work well . 
it is so nice to work with quality tools . 
the braun does so much more and is only $
it is exactly like the battery that originally came in my phone . 
my family has used corningware and corelle for my entire life . 
not the most stylish ,  but it s all i use . 
genius designonly one con i found and its only limited to certain phones . 
can t run a kitchen without good mixing bowls . 
in short ,  i needed to do work over the phone . 
these little scrapers allow you to get rid of stuck on food . 
just be sure to buy the car charger . 
bluetooth ,  wifi ,  and gps remain off until i need them . 
i use these for storing items in the frig . 
but this little bugger makes my job easier than ever before . 
soups and stews were a cinch; everything came out well . 
i don t have something stuck in my num_extend
it cleans up easy and as you would expect itis very heavy . 
there are no wires to get in the way . 
the rubberized grip makes it nearly impossible to drop . 
this was an excellent price for the number of bags in the pack . 
no more prying with a pancake flipper trying to remove stuck cookies . 
the silpat cleans up quickly and the pan does ,  as well . 
i do see some differences in the printing on the charge plug . 
get that and you will get a day with your phone . 
loved them so much we plan on buying them all . 
the charging portion of this product is indeed well worth the money . 
i ve had these headphones for over num_num months without a single problem . 
i was very happy with these glasses when i first got them . 
this is a lot cheaper and works just as well . 
must have if gonna spend a long time with your headset . 
i ground some the same coffee and ran the espresso again . 
you can t beat stainless for cooking quality and durability . 
after mine died ,  my husband promptly replaced it for me . 
i had lots of trouble with touching keypad without mistakes using my fingers . 
the vast majority of my students and clients end up buying this cooker . 
the female usb addition is great to power other devices too . 
check the measurements before you buy to get just what you want . 
boxed well so they re not all smashed up . 
having it available via amazon is yet another bonus . 
they work fine and seem like oem samsung earphones . 
you really do get what you pay for . 
she uses it and have not even tried the others yet . 
works great in my car and still use it . 
we got this bag to wash his socks in together . 
it seems to do the job fine at that speed . 
is a good way to create a nice looking spice area . 
i have absolutely no complaints about this vacuum . 
i m always happy with fat daddio baking pans . 
i bought this as a gift for my mom . 
blueant said the product is discontinued and they will replace with supertooth light . 
the weight of the canner is pretty significant . 
i bought this on kind of a lark . 
just say ,   open weather ,   and my dvp shows me the forecast . 
this case is really nice for the price . 
all my pans are calphalon and i ve been very happy with them . 
mine closes neatly and is a welcome thumb rest during phone calls . 
i purchased my capresso burr grinder just under a year ago . 
for $ you can t go wrong !  would never buy another blender . 
overall it gets a num_num out of num_num from me . 
it also seems to boil water very quickly . 
good value for money and ease of use make it worth while . 
im giving it a num_num star mainly on price . 
i believe this case would protect the phone against much cracking danger . 
again ,  for the price you pay ,  i wasn t expecting much . 
it seemed to cut down on the plastic smell . 
this is my absolute favorite purchase from amazon so far . 
i really enjoy the size of this charger it is small and effecient . 
the otterbox was nice but a bit on the thick side . 
i love it for searing when i cook . 
now rambling to make the amazon minimum word limit . 
this product does exactly what you expect it to do . 
this was from num_num phones ago  at least  . 
these glasses are so nice !  they seem very strong and sturdy . 
so a num_num star rating is still appropriate imo . 
the rubber handles are incredibly useful ,  specially for the larger cup . 
product arrived on time and in great condition . 
it would also be much better if it played louder sounds . 
easy to remove if you have kids that need a shallower depth . 
the weight of these tongs could also be a problem . 
i have two small kids and the phone falls constantly . 
those are usually lesser ma and therefore slower in charging my phone . 
i am slowly replacing all of my cookware with scanpan . 
this dish brush works great for cleaning my dishes . 
these measuring cups are fast becoming my favorite set of measuring cups . 
note that the ipad only charges on the ipad port . 
i like this horizontal style peeler much more than the vertical style peeler . 
thank you oxo for making high quality products !  . 
this is the most versatile pot i own . 
these are solid ,  well made ,  heavy glass bowls with flat bottoms . 
i put it in a plastic jar sold on here as a trap . 
your screen is totally exposed to the world . 
was very quick to ship and get in my mail box . 
got it for about $ using a coupon at linens and things . 
we ve used krups for years and they last and last . 
so now it is on the cusp of being worth it . 
this one is far sturdier and works well . 
i love baking cakes and this one turned out really pretty . 
the important plus to this product is how it does the job . 
this was disappointing but not enough to merit returning the set . 
instructions that came with it are not very helpful . 
for leftovers ,  the num_num small round containers are not all that useful . 
the pan is very well seasoned and the silicone handle is comfortable . 
this was a nice starting point to her collection . 
the black on an lcd is ,  by comparison ,  a dark slate . 
this was slightly disappointing for my intentions of preparing gravies on the side . 
all arrived unbroken and were packaged very well . 
after it cools down my dogs lick it clean . 
now it is num_num week that i m using this battery . 
love the folding blade when not in use . 
the speeds are fast and turbo so go easy when first using it . 
i have num_num cars and i tried another with a suction cup issue . 
i ve always had issues with blenders that i ve purchased . 
one friend has already ordered one like mine . 
it has plenty of volume ,  and callers are crystal clear . 
we always use cutting boards as a tip from other reviews . 
now ,  my streak is not destined for the recyclers ,  just yet . 
works as expected and it is nicer than the old press . 
it is definitely easy to use and clean and i use it also . 
the water flow from our kitchen faucet was anemic . 
these end up settling over a range of many inches of the counter . 
they are a nice large size which is hard to find anymore . 
we bought a total of num_num bowls ,  they all came as stated . 
silicon grip is very slippery in the hand . 
when i am in my computer room i also bring it with me . 
i wanted a case that provided above average protection . 
the baker did an excellent job and the bread was delicious . 
they also roll up nicely if you secure with a rubber band . 
as a gift the recipient has greatly enjoyed having the set as well . 
the motor does make a slight burning kind of smell . 
solidly made ,  cuts well ,  cheese falls right off after slicing . 
the unit fits comfortably and securely on my ear . 
this mat has worked great for baking my braided breads . 
i got these mainly to make egg muffin sandwiches . 
but this little presto device is quite spiffy . 
the fact that it can t spill is the most valuable feature . 
it is doing the job much better than i thought it would . 
just be careful you don t get your fingers in the way . 
there are two settings on this vaccum :  carpet and bare floors . 
it s so freakin cute and cool i really like it . 
i have used it to make mini version sof my quickbreads for gifts . 
i am very pleased with this table cloth . 
nice color and a great one to protect my phone . 
essentially ,  they look like you just took them out of a num_extend
this was fine until i received the pvp . 
we tried repeated cleanings ,  but that didn t help . 
fast delivery and good value for the price . 
i love how this screen protector really protected my phone . 
use any utensil it seems indestructible so far . 
this is by far the best corkscrew i ve ever used . 
be sure to remove the lacquer on the inside . 
i got the uk version of the galaxy num_extend
its solid and used it with good results a few times already . 
this was a really good purchase ,  and i am very pleased . 
almost any size cell phone fits into this holder . 
they work well either way . i love the shape and convenience . 
my view for a decent waffle is just what it says . 
it is good for turning large items on the pan . 
he says it really makes cooking fun !  works well with potatoes . 
i love the color and it makes my phone look like a creamcicle . 
it keeps the tea hot for a long time . 
one of my favorites from my extensive sitram catering collection . 
i ve bought so many chargers and they always break . 
love it and use it frequently at my house . 
by that time i had already replaced the phone from another vendor . 
i liked the fact that it kept the phone upright while charging . 
to be fair ,  i was walking around in nyc . 
you don t need to spend big bucks on pots and pans . 
the loaf had a better crust than ones using the cast iron pot . 
eventually my old case fell apart and had to be replaced . 
it fits perfect across my window num_extend inches length  . 
it is easy to clean ,  very powerful and quick . 
i would be careful measuring anything hot into them . 
usually my original battery would be dead in a couple of hours . 
cook tender steaks without the meat looking tenderized . 
bought this for my daughter to match her pink ipad case . 
the lid didn t hold up as well as i thought it would . 
i love these glasses and their unique artistic shape . 
i have half a dozen iphone num_num cases . 
not a really big deal but rather stupid they couldn t measure correctly . 
nice quality stainless steel ,  come in a wide variety of sizes . 
we will definitely be using these pans on a regular basis . 
so much that i ordered three of them . 
lost them ,  make sure u put them where u can find them . 
it will make a great gift for any wine drinker . 
this cover is very well made and a very pretty red . 
grind them with a good quality conical burr grinder . 
this car charger is high quality and works great . 
the fork tip is priceless when transferring sliced food !  . 
rubber iphone cases are better than plastic ones . 
i typically only wear it in the car . 
glad it was cheap i needed a case asap . 
it does not happen slowly ,  it happens in an instant . 
the extra trays allow me to take advantage of dying a larger harvest . 
my lid wobbles pretty badly which i find irritating . 
it plays my music nicely and phone calls are pleasant . 
i knew better but i got impatient ,  tried that and things stuck . 
sometimes they fall off but they are easily reattached . 
this product is a must have for baking . 
i m an accomplished cook and frequently downsize recipes for num_num servings . 
you have to use it in your right ear . 
too cool  !  !  !  much easier than using a frying pan . 
can be a little loud on the higher settings . 
already used several times with not one problem . 
one was for us and the other for our daughter . 
sturdy and very versatile , and very sexy in black . 
you may be surprised with how good their knives are . 
its that good . i have had num_num other espresso machines . 
check yours for the plastic ring before you put oil in it !  . 
the lodge skillet comes unpolished ,  meaning it has a textured surface . 
definitely recommend to any ice cream lover that has a kitchenaid !  !  . 
large enough area to feel like any standard size cutting board . 
it has the potential to go with lots of different decor . 
it is not to the point that it is not bearable . 
i use this every day and it grinds the coffee perfectly . 
i even cooked the bacon i used in my panini sandwiches . 
just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils . 
the stainless ones without a handle get very hot . 
just the right size for me as well . 
i wash it every few days with dr . 
not so big that they slide and get away from me . 
if you have bread making experience that would be helpful . 
for the same reasons the other reviewers already gave . 
i broke mine and this was an excellent replacement . 
heat and stress can make that even faster . 
i am impressed with this product and with the quality . 
nothing much else to say here ,  it s pretty simple . 
that was a serious test of effectiveness . highly recommend . 
i bought this to cut foam to make cushions for a chair . 
we find it hard to believe we did not buy one sooner . 
my last machine had indented grips for that purpose . 
i upgraded to an iphone num_num and bought another otterbox defender case . 
or form a cup with the paper towel in the sink drain . 
works like a charm !  should have gotten one sooner . 
if you want to get healthy .  . this can assist you . 
the extra usb port is useful without the need for a splitter . 
has held up really well after num_extend of use . 
the price can t be beat at num_num cents . 
the only thing is the vocalyst app i wouldn t pay for it . 
buy with confidence ,  there s a reason krups has their high reputation . 
now you just put it on the num_num minute timer . 
love that you can strain tea in there . 
pairing was a bit tricky in fact i almost thought mine were defective . 
the cover locks down tight ,  i have never had an accident . 
made a chicken dish and it was completely cooked in num_num minutes . 
if that gets fixed ,  i d give it a num_extend
works great for people who cook a lot . 
first off ,  the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid . 
it gains speed quickly in a few seconds is at operating speed . 
got roadsync  version num_extend for discounted price from ovi store and loving it . 
loved that this case was easy to take off and put on . 
you re not going to get a good vacuum for $ or so . 
this is a great mug and it works as advertised . 
i bought two of these pans for a gift and one for myself . 
we use this for our drinking water ,  coffee water ,  tea water . 
i have no problems recommending these to everyone . 
say what you will about snobby knife manufacturers ,  but shun is incredible . 
it stands up to heat well from what i can observe . 
everything is extremely easy to clean ,  attractive ,  and functional . 
looks the same too . the lid may be different . 
worked very well on my microwave that didn t have a turntable . 
nothing sticks to it which makes it very easy to clean . 
i purchased this grill in october ,  num_extend and have used it frequently . 
i actually paid twenty dollars for this a few months ago . 
this cover does the job and i m pleased with the results . 
on the other hand ,  you have a mess when you do that . 
i am sure these will last a lifetime !  . 
it was delivered promptly and he was happy with the gift . 
the picture of the product shows the single button on the side . 
this provides a clean surface on which to place the lid when stirring . 
this is the best product ever for protecting my iphone . 
i highly recommend this if you have an htc evo shift . 
it helps rests my spoons when i am cooking . 
i have never been a good cake decorator . 
i ve been through a lot of bluetooth earpieces . 
this coffee maker is absolutely worth every penny and makes truly good coffee . 
this is a great chopper for every day use . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
it is sleek in appearance and easy to use . 
received the sim card in about four days . 
i really like how it snugly fits on the frame . 
so inexpensive and you get num_num pieces  nicely packaged num_extend
the piece is attractive ,  and was reasonably priced . 
but pointed directionally ,  it does blow pretty well . 
these appear to be completely authentic oem batteries . 
i just wish it could handle more at once . 
alton brown recommends you pop your corn in a paper lunch bag . 
i love the color and enjoy using it for all of my recipes . 
this was the perfect size for my kitchen drawer . 
i m not sure if that is a headset or app problem . 
hit medium and in num_num seconds everything is perfectly and completely blended . 
it tasted and  felt  very professional because of the texture . 
still absolutely love the web os and the palm devices . 
i use whole beans and love the grind and brew feature . 
this is why the knife is so great . 
i found this processor on amazon and bought it . 
this is the combo to beat and highly recommend !  . 
it is light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless . 
unfortunately ,  the info was not available on amazon or on thermos website . 
i can use this for my phone or tablet . 
now after a few runs i m very happy with it . 
tho it is still functional for use looks bad . 
so far ,  this machine has made great bread . 
but that s really to be expected with any coffee grinder . 
i have more cabinet space and that s plus . 
first ,  it was easy to mount on the wall . 
the suction mount works perfectly and feels secure . 
considering when these first popped on amazon they were num_num bucks . 
it offers great protection and is still sleek and good looking . 
much nicer for me than the dial ones . 
the fact that it s cordless gives it lots of versatility . 
i chose this canister vacuum after reading the reviews . 
it has a place of honor in my appliance cabinet !  . 
fits nicely in our shaker and strains our cocktails perfectly . 
i really like this filter and the replacement is easy to install . 
nice clear lid to see what contents are in your canister . 
the pricing here at the time i bought it was $ vs . 
i have put these along with the rod in hubby s bathroom . 
it has a dozen small protruding tips shaped like candy cones . 
this one is way nicer ,  once i figured out the gizmos . 
great for my baking and kitchen needs ,  mixing and scraping . 
i agree with what some others have said . 
it s very light ,  but does exactly what i need it to . 
it has an incredibly sharp blade and is very sturdy . 
you have to get this if you have these graters !  . 
this little item is perfect for my coffeekit . 
good job cuisinart !  !  nice finish doesn t scratch or peel . 
including wall charger ,  usb charger and car charger . 
the new back for the case fits snug and is of good quality . 
otherwise ,  it s easy to use and to clean . 
i ve recommended this stone to any of my friends who bake . 
i purchased this in december ,  along with a new coffee maker . 
it really does chill a bottle well and keeps it cool . 
i haven t used it yet but it s exactly as described . 
this is pretty sturdy despite it s simple design . 
the num_num is thinner and it weighs a lot less than its predecessor . 
usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer . 
these are the only ones i v tried that i would recommend . 
oxo is a new york city based manufacturer of quality housewares . 
it makes roasting healthier and also looks fun . 
i also travel a lot for work and use my phone a lot . 
it s redeeming quality is that sound is good . 
standing tall ,  it s really standing tall . battery is pretty good . 
but it is very handy for cookie dough and cleans easily . 
i have one myself ,  and have given out multiple units as gifts . 
this is a great product ,  but arrived very very very late . 
i purchased this product as i had one before on a previous phone . 
they are made very well ,  with excellent detail . 
it fills about % of our oven s bottom rack . 
there are matching grooves and lips between the sleeve and the plastic shell . 
the photos do not do this item justice . 
searched for months for the best deal on a mixer . 
this is a very attractive and functional electric fondue pot . 
for that purpose it works exactly as it should . 
he was pleased with the fork it came with as well . 
these canisters are very good quality stainless steel . 
this slicer is a great value and offers a nice design . 
i hope the infared glass bulbs will last a while . 
it is a bit clunky .  . that is the bad news . 
now the  feather  case by incipio is currently my case of choice . 
 i wouldn t buy the motorola keyboard ,  from experience .   . 
these are rather flimsy ,  but get the job done . 
it fits the phone nicely and looks wonderful . 
can t figure out why they discontinued it ,  its great !  . 
the part that you squeeze is rubber coated for comfort which is nice . 
if you tend to make a pot at once then get this one . 
i am going to order one soon for the travel trailer . 
the rack itself is made of sturdy chromed wire . 
i wanted pans that were not dark non stick . 
i use them all the time in the microwave . 
the cover is simple and plain but i love it . 
it also has the hookup jack for charging it . 
the one hiccup that i encountered was quickly resolved with customer service . 
my wife and i absolutely love this cleaning machine . 
we use it for paninis n chickn grillin . 
i use it monthly on the bedroom carpets and it works great . 
i received this almost a week earlier than expected . 
this one and the one i bought from the cell store do that . 
i really like these ,  i ordered them in red . 
i ve tried the rest ,  and think this is the best . 
they think the brake is pretty cool too . 
they are incredible to use compared to normal knives though . 
this case fits the num_extend perfectly !  it has no defects or blemishes . 
i have always wanted to try one of these to frost my cakes . 
i am very satisfied with this power pack . 
it s now part of the charm of the machine . 
slides in and out of pockets with ease . 
the quality of the plastic is excellent ,  not a rough edge anywhere . 
it is easy to set up and quick to heat . 
they look much much more expensive than they are . 
can pull it put and put back easily . 
better to under cook and add time until done . 
this product definitely increases my enjoyment of having a bread machine . 
this is not a kitchen essential ,  but i love it . 
i love the fact that it s dishwasher safe ,  too . 
the item arrived on time and in good condition . 
the shipping was faster than noted by four days . 
we use it at least once a day . 
i usually just put aluminum foil down there which makes cleanup a snap . 
best sounding earbuds for this price i have ever seen . 
so i trust it is made to norpro s high standards . 
ordered for a friend who has the iphone num_extend
this ring is thicker than the one that came with the oster blender . 
i love this phone an absolutely recommend it . 
i have had num_num different phone systems and headsets looking for nirvana . 
my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool . 
unfortunately i ended up with another air pocket in the same place . 
i stick a food thermometer sideways into meats to keep track of doneness . 
i have arthritis and the handle is so kindly . 
love it so much purchased more for friends and love it also . 
it do keep the bread from getting stale . 
well designed ,  easy to use ,  good functions ,  no complaints . 
to that end ,  the iphone num_extend does not disappoint . 
easy to use and so far nothing to complain . 
the thermometer snuggly fits into the holder ,  which i like . 
it s sooo nice to have perfectrice every time . 
very nice chrome curtain rings with chrome balls on the top . 
we then pinned student work along the clothesline . 
that may actually be better for my purposes . 
in fact i do not remember ever having a bad loaf come out . 
works as intended although i m not sure about the longevity . 
i ll be needing another since i lost this one . 
bought this to fit over my cuisinart num_extend pan and it fit perfectly . 
i also appreciate the design of the carafe . 
for the price it is a good mixer . 
this is much better than the default htc battery . 
i make fresh breadcrumbs and homemade black bean burgers . 
the ceramic is thick and apparently a good quality . 
this product is not a true hepa purifier . 
i have had wusthof knives for many years and i really like them . 
what i really like is how much more convenient it is . 
the fruit basket is big enough to hold two pounds of mandarins . 
it arrived quickly and the box wasn t too heavy . 
this is the only num_num jar spice rack i ve seen . 
i like rounded edges better ,  but that s again a personal preference . 
dont like to see my iphone scratched up . 
it just adds another charger to the collection . 
this purchase was one little indulgence that was really worth it !  . 
not too bulky like other heavy duty covers . 
the clean pot makes the best tasting coffee . 
so far this product has lived up to my expectations . 
these covers work well to protect our phone faces . 
these come apart easily so you can clean them . 
i was curious about wusthof s new  precision edge  technology . 
it works but kind of too loose when attached to the jawbone icon . 
the case works as a extended battery very well . 
it is decent to look at while being very functional . 
i use it for everything ,  and it has never failed me . 
the magnets are weak because i don t have much in there . 
by now ,  you can see i use my phone mostly for business . 
these are so easy to use and clean . 
i no longer get the fatigue associated with gripping the smaller styluses . 
it has three power settings and a variable setting thermostat . 
hey for a little over a $ can t beat that . 
i listen to movies ,  radio ,  and music on this thing . 
that is why i can t have an i phone . 
it works very well with the chrome dish rack . 
i have used all of them and they are great . 
i ve always had to use an extension cord with it . 
the prongs stick out ,  so just be aware of that . 
i like the look and feel of this product . 
it s small ,  but it s a good size for me . 
the carry bag holds the battery and included retractable usb cord . 
she loves this bowl and thinks it is a great size . 
this is the perfect case for my phone . 
it is easy to clean and looks beautiful . 
they are easy to clean and cut through steak like butter . 
i got a smiley face mug from the num_extend store . 
i have had round measuring spoons all my life and needed a change . 
it arrives to us via ups and all was well . 
this improves sound quality as well as volume and fit . 
i thought to much packaging was used in shipping . 
i bought one about num_num years ago and it s been amazing . 
i like it so much ,  i m buying a second one . 
works with any phone basically aside from iphone . 
they are are actual htc headphones and the quality is great . 
i have been using this one since about num_extend
this product is well designed and made ,  not perfect . 
it came with a small bag to cary it in as well . 
i will likely buy another of these fans next month . 
my husband attaches it to his grill using the magnet on the back . 
these are very large and very heavy ,  well worth the hefty price . 
i ve had my breadman ultimate for at least num_num years . 
it is cute ,  soft and a great protector for my phone !  . 
quick summary :  this headset works well with my laptop computer . 
get a better one and widen the hole if necessary . 
i must love the look and it must function perfectly . 
you can t beat the quality of wilton food colorings . 
what i liked originally is the simplicity of the cookware design . 
not to mention the beautiful cherry red color . 
this car charger works perfectly with all my verizon cell phones . 
so i m reducing the rating by one star . 
we couldn t believe what it picked up that our oreck left behind . 
it is slippery plastic and makes it really hard to grip the phone . 
this will protect my phone from scratches and light drops . 
the design makes it easy to keep the two pieces num_extend
i was tired of going through potato mashers every couple years . 
how much can i say about this product ?  lol . 
they use it for coffee ,  i use it for flax seed . 
i thought my phone was damaged and battery too . 
the seller was very fast and its actually pretty durable . 
it creates perfect grill marks on my food . 
also it is best machine for making break crumbs . 
plus ,  this vacuum has never given me any problems whatsoever . 
finally just spent more money and purchased this metal set . 
at least at the walmart near my home . 
these are a great addition to any kitchen . 
fits very snug on my droid x ,  easy to put on . 
on the other hand the car charger is also amazing . 
it sticks to the fridge with its magnet and is easy to read . 
the presto microwave popper has no such down time . 
only thing that could be different would be a side drain . 
they are space technology for your kitchen ,  and it works . 
covers the mixer and protects it as advertised . 
nothing else worked except this .  .  . well worht the money . 
this product has saved my phone for so long . 
wondering why anyone would pay $ for this bluetooth . 
these plastic bowls simply do not hold up . 
i love the sturdiness of these cooling racks and the space saving feature . 
but i will keep ordering this filter for the time being . 
the house air stays much cleaner using the blue air cleaner . 
i am enjoying this wok as much as my cast iron one . 
the feel isn t silk but not cheap either . 
and there are pour spouts on either side . 
haven t utilized all the features ,  but so far really like it . 
but ,  the other components also do a good job . 
in addition ,  the markings on this set use raised lettering . 
it mixes pretty much anything and has never stopped mid mix . 
not to mention if i take an edge of . 
great value ,  but it became more diffiicult to maintain after num_num years . 
easy to use ,  easy to clean and it works fast . 
this product appears to be a genuine original equipment blackberry car charger . 
nonetheless ,  it is pretty easy to clean and makes decent coffee . 
very good headset if you don t mind the wires !  . 
i purchased this rfid passport protector for my husband . 
i love this case and would definitely recommend it !  . 
this beaker is an exact replacement for the num_num cup bodum press . 
its rugged ,  sturdy ,  and made of good materials . 
great for trimming roasts and boning all kinds of meat . 
i had no idea how often i would use this . 
i lost it when i moved and was distraught . 
just be sure to hand wash to keep the wood in good shape . 
i m fussy about sound quality and i think they sound great . 
worked perfectly and it s a good thing to have around . 
i bought them to cut out letters in fondant for my cakes . 
since ive installed it ,  it has never come off . 
it is super sharp ,  and the construction is really solid . 
the fagor we got is made in spain ,  not china . 
i must admit i was surprised at how large this pan is . 
i like this holder for its look and quality . 
this replaced the one i got many years ago . 
it is easy to holster and unhoster my iphone . 
i like this one because it does not have plastic parts . 
i was looking for a tip set for my wife . 
comfortable wear ,  even for hours at a num_extend
i also use it to charge my ipad num_extend
arrived promptly and filled the bill as a gift . 
very pleased with the purchase and would gladly do business with seller again . 
i did this the first time and the audio was doa . 
is this product a necessity in most kitchen s ?  prob not . 
you have to remove the ipod from the case to dock . 
not too big at the same time not too small . 
the carl zeiss lens helps ,  but you ll still need decent lighting . 
seek out a num_extend batter and your woes are over . 
the small charging cable is short ,  which i liked . 
i ve deployed this pan several times since purchasing in october . 
i m new to canning ,  but this product has been great . 
recommended for general use ,  is holding up well . 
i loved these knives right out of the box . 
im new to cake decorating so i have really enjoyed this book . 
when it fails completely i will get another one . 
this is by far the best headset i have used . 
the food processor leaked from the bottom before even turning on the machine . 
i wish i had bought this years ago . 
so overall ,  a nice product with a few disapointments . 
it looks great and it does it s job perfectly . 
i can use decent headphones with this and the controls work fairly well . 
finally i did and i likedthe quality of the rack . 
i love this pan ,  worth the dollars  !  !  . 
it is perfect for my nexus num_num cell phone . 
the charged canister of cream lasts and lasts in the refrigerator . 
pan is small but stove is small also ,  it works for me . 
i ordered four ,  for when i inevitably do something stupid to it . 
the shape of this pan influences the texture and taste of the cake . 
i m not sure what a quiet fan would sound like . 
after being used for a while the plastic piece will eventually break . 
i wasted num_num pieces before getting my satisfaction . 
my wife uses this for her iphone num_extend
we use these as our everyday wine glasses . 
this new one is absolutely silent ,  the older one is very quiet .

i ll tell you what ,  these were a fantastic deal . 
one was broken on arrival ,  but the glasses themselves are great .

i can t get used to electric stove and i burn a lot . 
however ,  they turned out to be exactly what i wanted .

price for performance you can not beat this little machine . 
i added a teaspoon last night and it was maybe a little vigorous . 
the lime color was the cheapest priced adapter for some reason . 
another reviewer mentioned batter sticking to the basket .

i got a good deal when buying num_num packs of this . 
the handles with rubber grips are substantial and sturdy . 
this seems to cause wear on a bearing in the fan .

 although nothing sticks so there is no fond !   .

the case is thin and light and comfortable to use . 
but even with the pins ,  i m glad i bought these . 
i ve had it for almost a week and it s worked well . 
there is also a charger in the box . 
it s pretty much a staple in the kitchen . 
to use as for work calls on her cell phone  galaxy nexus  . 
glad i bought them anyway and none of mine broke . 
the outside does get hot but neither of us have ever scalded num_extend
i use this as a gaming mic on my computer . 
there is no feedback with lights like the older num_num unit . 
the charger i purchased there didn t charge the phone . 
this sort of microfoamed milk is delightful in lattes . 
i would definitely recommend this to every and anyone  !  . 
we would love to see a version in stainless .

how he broke this bowl is a mystery . 
this is a correction to my previous review . 
i felt stupid when i bought it off a gold box special . 
so i was kinda skittish on this buy mixed reviews makes me nervous . 
they heat evenly and you don t require as much heat for cooking . 
the sound is very clear most of the time . 
by the second morning they were completely gone . 
i like the physical feel of a qwerty keyboard . 
it doesn t look sharp but it sure is . 
the concept behind the shapes and materials is effective . 
the order came to my mailbox in num_num days in a nifty box .

if it lands screen down ,  it s going to do some damage . 
this phone handles calls and data requests very quickly . 
the cozip fits very nicely and adds very little weight or bulk . 
i think this is very well thought out ,  great product . 
il now prohibits idiots from using their phone  to ear  while driving . 
i purchased this after my other pitcher dropped on the floor and shattered . 
well made ,  looks good ,  and will expand by purchasing another unit . 
the price was right and i got it on time . 
none of mine broke yet despite dishwasher ,  teens and cats . 
very ,  very thick and creamy ,  and no sweeteners . 
it came quickly and is just what i wanted . 
you do have to read instructions to understand how they work . 
android requires a high processing power so those phones have higher speed processors . 
this is exactly what it says it is . 
they can run at high speed or at more sedate speeds . 
so i had been searching for another one for a long time . 
if you own a white num_extend and want to see the color . 
i use this charger to keep a fresh battery on backup . 
very glad i bought one of these from amazon . 
i am very happy with this new pan . 
so this  bendy handles  issue is just all wrong . 
i was surprised how quickly i received it . 
the sound quality for voice calls is crystal clear . 
coffee made in a french press should be consumed immediately .

the different colors are convenient when slicing and dicing different items . 
works great to keep towels off bathroom floor . 
i make apple pies and it makes life a lot easier .

with my note app ,  i can write and sketch notes . 
these are fantastic for storage and taking food to work . 
love this pan !  i would definitely recommend this to others . 
it had scratches on it and certainly looked used . 
best of all ,  the controls for setting the humidifier work great . 
green peppers and soft foods just turn into juice . 
then there was the biggest problem :  it was consumable . 
i use this to get the chopped product to the bowl . 
num_extend amps . i took off one star for the price . 
for slicing ,  i prefer the microplane medium ribbon grater . 
going to try to make zucchini noodles next time . 
the metal one may be the same on this issue . 
it works ok for other types of cleaning like soap scum , etc . 
the case would not protect the front screen very well . 
we ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned . 
i store the food processor cup in a cabinet beneath it . 
i got this food processor as a wedding present ,  really like it . 
of course we do  baby  it by cleaning only with a soft sponge . 
use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor . 
but for the price do yourself a favor and by this vacuum . 
it is to wide and deep for this phone . 
it would be great if the belt is expandable . 
i love the chemex for brewing drip coffee . 
i got this to charge my atrix batteries . 
some braun coffee makers have a replaceable water filter cartridge built in . 
i bought this to use with their cookware and it performs as promised .

a must have if you re the average joe . 
got away from making my own moving to microwave . 
makes the phone a bit thicker but not much . 
perfect for making even ,  medium sized chocolate chip cookies . 
pairing was flawless on my phone that took less than a minute . 
this little popper is fantastic ,  so fast and really easy clean up . 
additionally ,  the product is sturdy ,  well made ,  and attractive . 
my only change would be to make this a bit taller . 
none defective and perfect add on weight to an iphone . 
we are very pleased with this tortilla press . 
good product ,  works perfectly well with all touchscreen devices . 
so far it s been good so hopefully will last awhile . 
ordered this for my child ,  yet she never put this cover on . 
once on ,  the results seem good with decent protection . 
just don t cut the tip off  till they re ready to use . 
this brings my total up to two living ware platters . 
we started buying new mexico chilis whole and grinding them . 
if you can find it ,  the refurbished model is amazing value . 
i have otterbox on several products . thank you amazon !  . 
i plan on getting larger and other sizes as well . 
broccoli and green beans are great in this steamer . 
the jar and blade clean up perfectly in the dishwasher . 
i took it apart to wash it ,  which was easy . 
i bought this hot air popper for health reasons . 
it looks like it will hold up real well !  . 
very good vacuum for hard surfaces; tiles ,  wood etc . 
it is very pretty and substantial in weight and construction . 
i also bought the indoor kit which works just as well .

i notice that a few people had stoppers that leak . 
works really great to have the retractable cord . 
ordered two ,  one was fine the other was scratched and marred . 
otterbox commuter case is as good of case needed for most situations . 
i added a little water in bottom to help the steaming process . 
this is a sharpening steel and it works well . 
i should mention that i have smooth ,  ceramic tile in my shower . 
it is easy to store and is just wonderful . 
i am just learning to can and and my friend suggested the presto . 
seriously ,  this is hotter than normal steam . it works very well . 
it has multiple hand holds ,  which is nice . 
i like the feel of the case as well . 
the first was a refurbished convection toaster oven . 
it turns a bit darker after it num_extend regular bacon  ex . 
i don t care what anyone says about shatter proof glass . 
hahai ve read complaints about this filter s solid plastic bottom . 
this spatula works great and is a perfect size . 
of course ,  then the glare control may dissipate . 
i will definitely be purchasing more at this great price . 
it works very well ,  but the only drawbackis its weight . 
since i drink my coffee black ,  there were no additives . 
i nearly walked int the shower with it the other day . 
no trouble in mixing a fairly large batch of bread dough . 
you gave to put the filling on the dough before you cut . 
had seen it on america s test kitchen review . 
it looks nice ,  feels nice ,  and provides good protection . 
this case fits perfectly and gives good impact coverage . 
i have a special standard for bluetooth devices . 
i have used it mostly for baking chicken pieces and roasting vegetables . 
plus i can use the cover on my other num_num inch skillets . 
it holds an entire large tube of oatmeal and then some . 
roomba is the best pet that i have ever had . 
the arm and vent mounts are as good as i have seen . 
great for use as a cleaver or a slicer . 
the velvet bag is rather useless as a protector . 
we are not chef s nor do we own extremely expensive knives . 
the black and silver are however ,  definitely black and silver . 
now i want to go make a roast . 
i have many cases that are nice but i prefer this one sometimes . 
i use this for frosting smaller cakes ,  especially smash cakes . 
lately i have been experiencing a loss of signal and dropped calls . 
the old dutch would crumple if our cat jumped on it . 
i saw this on a cooking show and liked what i saw . 
the colors are great ,  and they fit the phone well . 
at $ this is definitely not for the kids . 
got it for $ on sale last year . 
i think the hotness is acceptable if you do not add refrigerated creamer . 
again ,  another winner from nordic ware bundt pan collection . 
light ,  easy to use ,  connects easily with both cell phones . 
i have a longstanding habit of buying headsets and then not using them . 
within num_num minutes or so my allergies are noticeably lessened . 
i have several forged blades including comparable wusthof and henckels costing upwards of $
drop a few times ,  and expect it not to num_extend
one for my old iphone num_num and one for my young nephews num_extend
it s misleading and dishonest ,  as well as bizarre . 
nice touch making the size markings so they can t rub off . 
perfect toy fior warming butter and cooking eggs very fast . 
great factory replacement parts for plantronics plt num_extend
i like to grill some meats and fish indoors . 
i have been using this kettle for about four months . 
microsdhc slot puts the num_extend ahead of the num_extend in my opinion . 
i will be purchasing either roadsync from dataviz or touchdown . 
i wanted tongs without plastic tips because stainless steel is easier to clean . 
but a few uses showed just how simple it was . 
i ordered this because it had better reviews than any gsm version . 
for a $ product ,  the quality is good . 
it works great whipping and mixing hot chocolate . 
kinda thick but very comfortable and definately protective of phone . 
i probably will upgrade my old case to one like hers soon . 
the bowl also works well for fruit ,  popcorn ,  soup . 
the only downside is that she now cooks too many cakes for us . 
the color is nice ,  not as bright turquoise as the picture . 
it has a soft rubber like feel and its light weight and simple . 
it is very clear at the same time . 
i suspect that a slamming door would cause it to fall further . 
my girlfriend likes pink ,  and this is pink . 
i use the bottom of the measuring cup . 
i leave mine on the counter and it takes up very little room . 
store them safely or you will hurt yourself and ruin the knife . 
the toaster is nice and small and fits nicely on the counter . 
while its a single core at least it has num_num ram . 
they are nice and dense and don t splinter easily . 
perfect for my hollandaise and bernaise sauces !  love it !  . 
it boils very quick . some people complained about the plastic smell . 
it is super steady because of the rubber footies . 
i am glad i bought this battery at this price . 
i fixed this with a little guerrilla glue . 
my only wish is that this had an off switch . 
these are really worth the price i paid . 
this pan is excellent as others had rated it . 
i am making a very conscious effort to buy american . 
i d like to purchase the num_extend set as well . 
seido leaves the option to use your own screen protector . 
this has become my go to spatula for just about everything . 
i use it to cool my cookies on . 
this works as expected and i haven t had any problems with it . 
i would recommend being very careful with it . 
i have been very impressed by the battery life . 
i can only commet on the coffee maker itself . 
so ,  i will update more after using it . 
i haven t had any problems with them smoking . 
the vent lets you keep the lid on while microwaving to prevent splatter . 
i use this machine a few times daily . 
good enough . this is just what i was looking for . 
this pitcher comes with a filter and easily fits in the fridge . 
a good variety ,  these silicone spatulas are fantastically useful . 
can a knife be too sharp ?  i guess not . 
favorite this is my all time favorite and i use lots . 
don t put water on it or try to scrub it . 
so glad i added this one to my cookware . 
sound coming from the num_extend stereo jack is pretty good . 
it has rubber layer inside then a plastic layer outside . 
it toasts wonderfully ,  looks beautiful and seems to be built to last . 
the retractable cable is a space saver and looks cleaner while stored . 
it s perfect in the oven for pot roast . 
i am a pastry chef and i think this product is excellent . 
very nice ,  cute case for a low price . 
chops the ice as well and adds air . 
they are the perfect size to slip into the toaster after that . 
they are great they work nice they have very good sound . 
went looking on amazon for what was available and what the reviews were . 
i hate to cook and have never used a pressure cooker . 
this led me to get myself one of their num_extend models . 
love the built in micro sd cord and charger battery status . 
she s not picky and she likes it a lot . 
i have cooked brownies ,  fish ,  veggies ,  pizza ,  ect . 
we really like this grinder as a flax mill . 
till this day it works great plus i love , love my tablet num_extend
i listen to music on it and the volume is great . 
the power button and volume buttons are hard to press . 
five star if they d make a stronger worm . 
this is a kingsize pad ,  which seems large for blocking . 
i never thought that rice cooking would become such a fun . 
i have lots of cases and this one is one of my favs . 
this one doesn t and it s darned near perfect . 
this is a great replacement for a cracked lcd of the iphone num_extend
the battery and cover fit with no problem . 
it looks great and sticks great to the side of the sink . 
my wife had one of these from num_num or so years ago . 
very well made; just the right size; exactly what we expected . 
checked out this one ,  looked at the price and said ,   wow  . 
the best and fastest way to make excellent ice cream and sorbet . 
it serves its function ,  i have not burned myself using it before . 
resistant against scratches and does not get in the way of any functions . 
i wish i had discovered this years ago . 
if you deadlift ,  you must have these headphones . 
greater and larger popping among kernels than cooking in a glass jug . 
these look really good on our cast iron cookware and work . 
the lid is great and so far no leaks . 
once it activates ,  the phone comes right off your belt . 
i happened to stack them on top of each other . 
people seem to be getting a little critical . 
this unit gives great sound for its size . 
tools that help you control serving temperatuer add toyour pleasure . 
the design is nearly seamless ,  which makes it very easy to clean . 
it charges my phones ,  that is what i was looking for . 
pro offers num_num watts and a bowl  lift  function . 
just press the answer button and you can answer the phone . 
awesome small adapter ,  no complains ,  i use to play games . 
the second is the order in which machine parts are tightened . 
needed more room for my jerky so added two more trays . 
you can put your lid on this upside down and coals beneath it . 
we make ebleskivers all the time and this pan works great . 
this iphone num_extend case seems to be just as good . 
his feet don t quite touch the floor yet  . 
the automated voice announces when you receive a phone call . 
when you are eating it you feel so healthy . 
you don t need to use this with motorola phones . 
however ,  it is a bit too small for cooking a large pizza . 
i do not find it to soft like other reviewers . 
hard to beat $ each and they go in the dishwasher . 
i just recently bought this pitcher although not on amazon . 
i do vaccuum the unit every other month to clear the vents etc . 
you can t just hold your finger down to advance the time . 
i got it pretty fast in the mail . 
i think that is wholly dependent on where you live though . 
i got this from amazon in december num_extend
i bought a smaller size one ,  and got small cookies . 
they have a nice heavy bottom with a fairly smooth underside . 
it s compact ,  easy to store and easy to use . 
then we transfer the queso to this bowl and eat . 
this is a true mercury thermometer and the reading is % accurate . 
appears very well built and a quality product . 
it arrived and i used it without issue . 
love that you can cook different items on each side . 
it holds enough for two regular mugs that includes espresso in the mugs . 
i ended up peeling it off because it was really bothering me . 
my job requires me to carry a pager . 
i m not saying i don t like this pot . 
i never even clean it as i only use it for these sweeteners . 
it works well with both my iphone num_extend and ipod nano . 
she also really likes the color and function . 
putting it on a sheet tray lined with aluminum foil solves the problem . 
other than that i think that it is great . 
i have mine paired to num_num at this time and all is well . 
i use the maxipedtion phone holster on a duty belt and works perfectly . 
this is a very simple product that looks good and does its job . 
bought this because i had lost my old one on the plane . 
of course ,  i probably use it more often than the other knives . 
then i bought my son one who owns a bar and grill . 
the screens are easier to clean than the trays . 
good size ,  and the produce bags from the grocery fits fine . 
now you re left with a drinking glass with a handle and spout . 
it was very easy to assemble by myself and looks great . 
i wouldn t rate this product num_num stars if it was num_num dollars . 
he fell onto his left side and hit the asphalt . 
i ve used these on num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and num_extend pans . 
butter can be melted on the top . easy cleanup . 
this was just what i was looking for . 
the water that comes out is very clean and refreshing . 
again ,  this seemed apparent due to the different container design . 
really ?  then use a butter knife ! nice handles ,  feel good . 
does what it is supposed to do ,  protect . 
if it breaks it cooked too long but will still be delicious . 
the clips are the most durable for these types of cases . 
purchased for my num_num year olds i phone . 
i plan on ordering a set for a frirnd . 
its plenty big enough and easy to clean . 
still have my original set ,  old town blue . 
this was a nice replacement and it handles the job . 
i used it the same day i got it . 
this popcorn maker creates the best buttered popcorn around . 
i like the small design and would hate for it to be larger . 
but ,  for the price ,  i really cannot complain . 
it must be the sanitizing effect of the sun . 
my only disappointment is that this doesn t come in more colors !  . 
the customizations you can do with it is great as well . 
fits perfect and is very nice for the phone . 
i use this french press at my work office . 
this does what it claims and simultaneously charges an ipad and iphone . 
worked out great ,  but the wires were in my way . 
the music streaming ability ,  sound and the color . 
quality is good ,  and they hold up well in the dishwasher . 
use in a convection oven ,  from fridge   not the num_extend
the price of this product is a little high ,  but reasonable . 
i personally love the oval shape compared to my last round one . 
works on carpet or a small change and back to bare floors . 
bought this to sharpen my mac and global knives . 
it works well with the artisan bread in five minutes wet dough . 
secure but not tight with no risk of falling out . 
simply drain the liquid out of the yogurt for a few hours . 
a wonderfully useful addition to my kitchen aid appliance . 
so i wanted something which is compact ,  easy to use ,  horizontal . 
one of the edges flares out ,  which makes it easy to grasp . 
they make a less than perfect baker seem like a pro . 
the lid because it almost never has had stuff on it . 
once it arrived ,  it looked and performed just as my old charger . 
i bought two different types of replacement ear pads ,  and still nothing . 
i have had it for two weeks now . 
this is a basic bluetooth that is very simple to pair . 
this is the best waffle maker i ve ever used . 
all my issues solved and made the sausage making a pleasure . 
we use ours in the bathroom and it works great . 
it can cook up to four regular sandwiches or num_num big ones . 
i find you have to unplug the machine and replug it to reheat . 
this is the third set of these i have bought . 
i drink a lot more water because of this . 
would have been nice to have a brighter contrast . 
this is the standard all others are trying to match . 
other than that ,  it s a great hand mixer . 
love it for moving from car to car . 
in the morning ,  i packed my lunch and brought it to work . 
almost a year later both are still going strong . we love ours . 
my husband loves when i cook too much food and there s leftovers . 
it fits in my pocket or messenger bag easily . 
it is reportedly sturdier ,  but also even bigger and bulkier . 
got a message about a file it could not find . 
always helpful when trying to get a good fit . 
i really appreciate that the company makes and sells replacement parts . 
weekly bleachings of the dishcloths eventually wear the rags out . 
holds my phone at the perfect level ,  same as other dashboard gauges . 
you ll discover that perfectly toasted bread is just the beginning . 
we use this for bananas and other foods too and it performs admirably . 
maybe i m a little picky but it drove me nuts . 
i just received this yesterday and put in my car . 
biggest  gripe  :  the vertical design is not real stable . 
they re nice and thick glass and appear very durable . 
had to search and search for an all metal one . 
we have larger ones for large amount of food . 
it simply expands to fit the sinks perfectly . 
trimming fat off a hunk of roast is a breeze . 
the food comes out juicy and so tender . 
cheap quick fix for a broken iphone num_num glass with digitizer . 
as little as num_extend sometimes and at most num_num hours .

excellent kitchenaid quality and value !  highly recommended !  a+ !  .

pyrex is the name and nothing else is the same . 
all in all i m thrilled with my new food processor .

which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset . 
i found it online ,  and that was a huge plus .

hope it s ok ,  but there is no other option . 
my fiancee drives semi and has to be hands free . 
this is an inexpensive oil free popper that makes popcorn fast and easy . 
these things are light weight ,  comfortable and have pretty good sound quality . 
the holes in the stainless steel top are also right for this purpose . 
why not normal plastic ?  this is just baffling . 
my parents have always used cast iron skillets for all sorts of cooking . 
the base of it is about the size of a small toaster . 
not as satisfied as i was with it initially . 
holds up very well as well but can be difficult to get off . 
note that this is not a small fan . 
a great gift for any cook or baker .  .  . or yourself . 
i would have bought him the fine grit too ,  but it was $
the biggest cleaning problem at my house is dog hair .

my other feat is the placement of the release button . 
this tea cup infuser set is just perfect for me . 
the pan is heavy and the cakes turned out beautiful . 
the heating element works pretty well to keep the cheese hot and melty . 
very quick and easy and always ready on my counter .

it does not get smoky inside even with marinade drippings . 
and i would never forget that my tea water is boiling .

oxo makes the best stuff !  this peeler is no exception . 
this is a simple snap on type case ,  and not bad . 
overall these seem to be of good quality .

i am very happy with my choice and do recommend this machine . 
perfect product when you have limited space to use .

i had never really gotten on the food processor bandwagon . 
otherwise ,  it fit perfectly and exact match to the original . 
a little goes a long way ,  so use sparingly . 
single cup drip is all the rage ,  and these filters work great . 
looking for twine for summer bbq roasting and grilling . 
after two months of daily use the unit is working great . 
this design has been around for a while and it does its job . 
this was my second purchase of the same make and model . 
i would most likely use these for travel situations . 
it s good construction hard to get the headphones in and out . 
the one and two star reviews are really unfair . 
i was shocked . making a call was super ,  as well . 
the quality is good ,  love the hammered look .

they are made in the usa ,  not china stuff . 
this is a heavy duty glass storage unit . 
my son was paying an exorbitant amount from the store for this battery . 
it s a beautiful red and i love having it in my kitchen . 
this way we avoid the chemicals from the styrofoam or plastics  bpas  . 
cabinet makers don tworry if the black walnut dust gets into the pine . 
this is a great peeler for things like carrots and vegetables . 
would work great in a purse i suppose too . 
i bought this based on other reviews ,  and i was not disappointed . 
this stand works great for my iphone num_extend
they have outlasted most of my kitchenaid ones . 
works exactly as advertised ,  just like the original ,  stock phone battery . 
the motor is stronger too ,  but really you want the metal gears . 
the buttons actually feel better with this case on . 
have only used it on one loaf and there s almost perfect slices . 
works great paint rubbed off the corners but overall not bad . 
the key word is peel off the  mask  not the sticker . 
well built ,  no loose parts ,  no falling off earpieces . 
still loved it ,  and would probably buy it again . 
it just looks sexy on my white iphone num_extend
it is very powerful mobile machine that runs on maemo linux  think opensource  . 
i called electrolux to confirm that these were not genuine . 
i really enjoy having this scraper in my kitchen . 
easy to use ,  works as advertised on all kinds of cans . 
it is satisfyingly heavy and very good quality . 
it turns very easily and thats what i was looking for . 
i have had num_num dif ones now and this one is the best . 
we purchased this as a gift for dad for father s day . 
but really ,  the inserts are a very minor thing . 
yes ,  you can make rice on the stove . 
the barrel of the amazonbasics stylus is num_extend long . 
i use it to brown with but don t use the screen . 
if the steam stops coming ,  i just push the button right away . 
it works on my induction cooktop well also . 
no more trying to keep up with just one charging cable . 
mine has held up for years ever since this simple fix . 
check out the professional one ,  it s only $
since it has been over a year now . 
sharp and compact ,  it has an elegant look and feel . 
fits nicely ,  looks good but will not stand up to much . 
i personally prefer using it in landscope as it makes the keypad bigger . 
it also comes with num_num different shaped ear buds . 
it is a fair price for a blender that works well . 
cover hinges and wooden base are study and seem to be well made . 
i bought this to add to my fiesta collection . 
it makes it worth while to buy whole ,  fresh pineapples . 
you re cooking with less fats and that s good for your health . 
it arrived towards the end of the estimated arrival date . 
they worked pretty well ,  no problems at all . 
it looks very nice even though the black version might look better . 
this is our num_extend cuisinart ice cream maker . 
the key is to follow the instructions for use and cleaning . 
but it s not nearly as foolproof as a good burr mill . 
it is cheaply made ,  but it serves its purpose . 
i highly recommend these . anchor hocking is such an iconic american brand . 
this is super convenient and a great idea . 
i only wish that black had been included in this pack . 
less wasteful than using bags with the food saver . 
he uses it every day and loves it . 
also ,  it has great instructions for tips on using the zoku . 
my fourth peppermill .  .  . this purchased according to previous reviews . 
traveled with it thought a busy airport and dropped it .

it is hard to beat cast iron cooking about anything . 
i love all of the cuisinart chef s pans !  .

the width allows it to accept other phones too . 
it provides excellent overall protection in a combination of layers . 
it s the perfect size and it sticks really well . 
people have no problem hearing me or i them . 
received case and was really please with the way it looks . 
happy with that xx xx xx xx xx xxx xx xx . 
i like the more flexible turners but this is ridiculous . 
these are the kind of pans you pass on to your children . 
first impressions matter and skinomi knocks it out of the park . 
it s ideally sized in order accommodate either of those games . 
best coffee maker i have owned ever !  !  num_num stars !  !  . 
it s quite handy to have this feature when measuring large quanties . 
the length is a bit awkward but it does do the job . 
i received this french press as a christmas gift . 
 i will recommend ordering them from cellular num_num star .   . 
motorola explained it :  my unit is defective and needs to be exchanged . 
but i don t like spilling coffee at all . 
better to have it on the cutting board ,  than your counter top . 
i like this parchment paper especially since it is not bleached . 
i havnt used this yet but the quality looks fine . 
i then read some reviews and got a little worried about my purchase . 
what can i say that the product description doesn t ?  it works . 
i have had one for num_num years and i love it . 
i like to work with medium length knives and this is it . 
for the price that it is ,  its not bad . 
it is very attractive ,  if you want to call a charger attractive . 
 and we are not talking about a year of really heavy use . 
charge my iphone num_extend my ipad num_extend and my friend s iphone num_extend
this works so well i bought my son one for christmas . 
i don t think i would use these out in public anywhere . 
you need this if you every make salads . 
there is more than enough slack to do so . 
i was able to use the old cord with the new kettle num_extend
for once being skeptical ,  i am extremely happy with this purchase . 
this dual  car and home  charger is no exception . 
the battery also lasts for a long time . 
the fur was really attached to the carpet . 
it is gold tone not gold plated like the were in the past . 
and that s not counting the ones i ve returned . 
it keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows . 
i bought these containers for one reason .  .  . plastic containers smell . 
like most rubbery cases it does tend to stick in your pocket . 
i m glad i did !  wonderful knife for brownies and others . 
i never did know what to do with the lid . 
you really need to get the starter mixed well . 
as with most things in life ,  there is a trade off . 
it so annoying to have the cord catch on the clothes being pressed . 
it is swift and easy to use and clean . 
i love microplanes ,  they make short work of so many tasks . 
no complaints ,  more than what i expected for $
they have small chrome balls that let the curtain glide over the bar . 
its reviews like the guy before me that mars the system . 
you can control the thickness with this knife . 
i would give it num_extend stars for drip coffee use . 
ya you will love yourself for this one . 
still making sm cakes in it with great success . 
bought this for a friend who bought a yellow digitizer . 
my num_num yo daughter took it ,  and loves it . 
we use this pan every day for eggs and other small cooking chores . 
works beautifully and can t imagine a more useful basic kitchen item !  . 
high amp cause this thing charges my num_extend quick when im driving . 
the pan is great ,  very good quality and very heavy . 
both found the utensils easy and comfortable to hold . 
the classic scallop shape gives good grip without rupturing or puncturing food . 
over the years ,  i ve tried several ways to tenderize tough meat . 
because it works so well ,  i decided to stick with west bend . 
works like a champ and my first batch came out perfect . 
you can also use fresh or dried flowers . 
it s made of sturdy plastic and attached firmly to the mesh screen . 
i can bake mini brownies ,  mini candies ,  or party treats . 
though not indestructible ,  pyrex glass is very durable . 
also ,  sometimes the rubber tip is too far below the retainer ring . 
be careful as the element can get very hot and burn you . 
i assumed it was cheap and had overheated . 
it s quite large and will even hold ten ears of sweet corn . 
no issues yet ,  it still survives in the household of strong grips . 
lots of interesting and helpful information for a beginner . 
it will get stuck in the burr grinder . 
it feels like an extension of my arm when i am using it . 
they re thin ,  lightweight ,  super sharp ,  and super sturdy . 
for the price and what i use it for works great . 
this gets the job done by covering the ports but keeps it slim . 
nothing sticks and it cleans with just a swipe . 
it was not expensive and it also came packaged very well . 
i owned one of these for over num_num years . 
i purchased num_num of these awesome little storage bowls at christmas . 
it won t turn your phone into a brick either !  . 
i tested my iphone num_extend and num_extend and they both charge . 
that seems to be happening to my mafter silicone liners . 
i bought this awhile back for my iphone num_extend
his has been installed for almost a year now . 
i would recommend as part of another storage system . 
i forgot about it again ,  the tried again . 
adds a nice touch to the shower rod and curtain . 
i would suggest that anyone who hangs this thing do the same . 
this cuisinart seemed to be a good deal . 
i get lots of compliments on this one . 
sides are sloped well for tossing food while cooking . 
it brewed a great cup of coffee and so does this . 
this review is for the items i received from xitech . 
this hasn t ,  perhaps because it s been treated so gently . 
i warm my oil and vinegar on top while heating my garlic bread . 
usually these dirt cheap electronics from china have variable quality control . 
we like this so well ,  we have purchased several as gifts . 
need a sharpener every once in awhile and i found this one . 
highly recommended if you have limited funds and need to start canning . 
i purchased this mount for my iphone num_extend
this muffin maker is yet another example of a quality appliance from breville . 
but their function makes that little annoying fact worth dealing with . 
i get a couple hours of listening and then have to recharge . 
the products are working excellent and were very inexpensive . 
the nokia excels at both . i like the voip options of the num_extend
now we buy pineapples to core and slice ourselves . 
it might not fit perfect but it works great . 
so far after about a month it still works fine . 
not incredibly annoying ,  but enough so i docked them a star . 
now you re gonna have to close it again . 
bubbles are already forming and coming up from the heating element . 
they fit nicely in your hand ,  like so many other oxo num_extend
i m going to buy me the bigger one as well . 
this product is wonderful and performs just as expected . 
the blade is delicate and should be well protected when not in use . 
completely understandable . nothing to complain about regarding this case . 
i never would have guessed it could produce such a fantastic omelet . 
i have used this portable charge for a couple months now . 
i wish they made it in a smaller size . 
seems the quality of the stainless is only fair . 
but i don t think it ll be an issue . 
i currently am running ubuntu on my inspire num_extend
this is the third one i have ordered . 
the worst thing is the watermark on the screen . 
great for a nice hot cup of tea or cocoa in just moments . 
still ,  it won t let you overflow the bath . 
horizontal separation is more important than cable length . a great improvement !  . 
if i could rate this item with more stars than num_num i would . 
this model dwarfs the one i have now . 
keeps , the coffee hot for hours without a hot plate . 
the softer the meat ,  the more  mushy  the consistency will be . 
i m curious to check out the larger version . 
this is a good brand and a well made filter . 
they have it all from this affordable one to very high end ones . 
i also own a new trent charger which is equally good . 
i consider them to be basic middle of the road measuring cups . 
sleek and beautiful to have on my table . 
she actually charges the juice pack and then puts it on the phone . 
one of the best purchases i ve made this year . 
price was about % less than the wholesale club too . 
i ve already purchased a num_extend one for the other car . 
i m very pleased with this product ,  especially for the price . 
air dry the cheesecloth and secure again with fresh tape . 
the nokia num_extend is the best phone for your dollar . 
unfortunately ,  the concept didn t hold up in a real world setting . 
a great oem charger at a great price . 
watch the directfix video and did it in less than num_num minutes . 
it works but the phone looks super ugly in the cover . 
i did spend months researching juicers ,  reading reviews ,  and comparing prices . 
there is no wobble even when unevenly loaded . 
homer laughlin is a hotel china company ,  in fact . 
the beater bar started to rattle a bit . 
it is equally at home on a gas range . 
immediately on startup you have a voice prompt of power on . 
it has a timer for turning itself off . i recommend it highly . 
so a durable machine is at a premium . 
easy to change the shape of the cookie and easy clean up . 
i was looking to replace my thick ,  heavy wachersbach set . 
it is fantastic !  this is the most hydrated i have ever been . 
the freebie protector the store put on when i bought the phone . 
these are the best kitchen shears i ve ever owned . 
i choose this model because of two features . 
rubberized case are usually always the best in terms of phone protection . 
perfect gift for a cook that likes to bake . 
for my use ,  either the caseology or belkin would be fine . 
i think it worked great for a bluetooth . 
it keeps the rack underneath it reasonably clean . 
its not the best feeling bumper but certainly fits my iphone num_extend
ridding myself of the hand mixer would certainly free up an already busy num_extend
this bowl is the perfect size for soup ,  ice cream ,  etc . 
i read about this in a cooking magazine . 
as with most fiesta ware ,  it is heavier than pyrex . 
i had heard about the num_extend and wanted to give it a try . 
i was very impressed with the craftmanship of this peppermill . 
the otterbox s cover picked up a lot of dust and lint . 
this one is crystal clear on both ends . 
it keeps my hand warm in the cold winter . 
the items didn tstick at anytime during the cooking process . 
after a few hours my ear was very sore . 
it had been so long i must have thrown it away . 
my first last it num_num years and my phone is like brand new . 
love the knives ,  but i m disappointed in the shears  :   . 
and it does protect the phone from scratches . 
the iphone num_extend can slide right in with the bumpers . 
this item is on sale at amazon + free shipping . 
this was bought as part of a set to give to my wife . 
i did it and now i m noticing even more longevity . 
these are great for wet or dry products . 
this carpet cleaner took all of the stains out . 
unless there is something better ,  this will be my next phone . 
this stays charged for i know a couple of days . 
great headset for the price can not beat it . 
seems sturdy enough to keep pressurized over time . 
even my old hamilton beach machine from num_num had two lids . 
can be offered to children without fear of them injuring themselves . 
bought this along time ago and it is still working on my infuse . 
however ,  the brew still looked different vs the krups . 
used this several times with the ipad and same result  charged  . 
the led on the backside of the unit is way to bright . 
i like it ,  but the taste without the oil is different . 
why didn t i buy it sooner ?  order yours now . 
these are sturdy and easy to fit in small spice jars . 
this item is a godsend to people that are detail work challenged . 
after reading many reviews i decided on this one . 
i love that you get the gloss look with no fingerprints . 
i still have to get used to that . 
we also ported over our old verizon cell phone numbers to them . 
i love it !  very easy to use ,  clean ,  and store . 
we have gotten many compliments on it already . 
this is a good tenderizer ,  but dont put it in the dishwasher . 
the venta is exceptionally quiet and extremely effective . 
i will have no problem paying full price if it ever breaks . 
running num_num air purifiers is a serious comfort measure . 
other than that ,  no complaints at all about this cover . 
this is easy to use and makes perfect ice cream every time . 
the can opener doesn t even touch the food . 
the camera makes contact with whatever surface you place it on . 
other than that ,  i m still very happy with it . 
that one only lasted a year before i wore it out . 
i have had no problems with this thermometer . 
it is very convenient and doesn t slip at all . 
its really an awesome product and its worth the price . 
bottom line ,  you buy one of these mainly to make pancakes . 
the steak came out medium rare on one which my daughter loved . 
i highly recommend these items over the ones sold in the verizon store . 
i had to do this every time the car is switched on . 
i use one on each side of the bed . 
i suspected oil buildup and i was right . 
i bought another one for my mother and she is hooked now too . 
if she had not liked it i would give it a bad review . 
also ,  the shipper was good and the product arrived quickly . 
i forgot just how nice it looked when new . 
with the long handle it won t fit in the bge . 
i like the way the top cradles in your palm . 
i like them so much i bought more sizes . 
is great to have sellers that cary this item . 
i use simple mobile ,  its cheaper and faster . 
i got this primarily to help remove things from my panini grill . 
i happen to get lucky and come across something sleek and neutral . 
looks more menacing than meat cleaver but lighter weight and meant for veges . 
we highly recommend this garlic press even though it is quite pricey . 
it keeps noises eyes off your screen while you are texting or whatever . 
they sent me the astro num_extend and it is great . 
this gadget cleans the whole fish in no time flat . 
but your guess about the accuracy is as good as mine . 
i highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a bluetooth earpiece . 
i don t understand why so many people are complaining about the firmware . 
i bought this cover for my wife s phone and it works great . 
this is the brand sold all over italy . 
bought these for my mom s shower in num_extend
this roaster easily replaced my crock pot after the first use . 
the last phone i had i purchased four of these . 
i ll probably get a lid for it to cover all possible needs . 
bacon does not splatter ,  eggs perfect every time ,  fried or poached . 
more on this later . the hardware itself is quite decent . 
even the ports are more or less the same ,  the same weight . 
a friend of mine didn t see the cable and sat on it . 
both me and girlfriend both have smart phones . 
a nice feature as you don t have to look up anything . 
what a great little knife ,  good heft and very sharp . 
this helps with the excessive scratching endured during the life of my phone . 
the quality is consistent with other oxo products i have . 
i just got this pan today and immediately put it to use . 
i like the way they came in the mail . 
fits my galaxy s perfect ,  goes on easy and disappears . 
it fits perfect and does the job right . 
it certainly moves air without much noise ,  that s for sure . 
taken together ,  this product is much better than zagg . 
this is a fun cover for my phone . 
it is easy to use ,  easy to store and easy to clean . 
did not work well with microsoft voice command . 
wuesthof makes the finest knives money can buy ,  imho .

i recommend you to buy a back up battery . 
these sheets really make baking cookies a breeze . 
i ve had this carafe for a year now . 
but once on ,  its amazing hot strong it is .

now the pasta maker attachments ,  i haven t yet tried . 
just brush with a little oil and pour the batter in and cook . 
i love to cook in bulk and freeze for later . 
i ve always been a fan of oxo ,  because they rarely miss . 
don t waste your money on cool mist models . 
i also slice mushrooms frequently and shred carrots regularly . 
love that it fits in sink to soak if necessary . 
you can answer or ignore calls by voice . 
i have a sony ericsson num_extend phone ,  so setup was fairly easy . 
you can even store things in them in the fridge . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
i use a similar liturgy for the strainer piece . 
it s a little heavy ,  so be aware of that . 
it has two heat settings ,  as well as just a fan setting . 
i order num_num more for friends and they love it also . 
the extra large feed tube is a time saver . 
coffee beans have a natural oil that enhances the it s flavor . 
i got the product much quicker than i anticipated . 
i would buy an extra headset for doing school work and studying !  . 
why ?  because i don t ever want to go without it . 
so i bought three more to give as gifts to others . 
the corners are protected and it makes it likely to get a dent . 
look at my discussion of the norpro which i also own . 
rugs are much cleaner and look like new . 
great phone and net num_num service is really good too . 
i bought this case and been using it for a few weeks now . 
i like to carry my phone on my belt instead of my pocket . 
i ve had mine for a couple of yours . 
but it is not as cheap as beer on sale at the grocery . 
doesn t even need salt or butter in my opinion !  . 
i carry it in my backpack every day to college . 
this is a well made and easy to use mount for my phone . 
i had one of these for years and just loved it . 
no complaints about battery life for a device of this type . 
it s not a miracle pillow but it helps . 
this new silicone case is somewhat soft ,  and not near as sticky . 
in addition ,  it s bright and cheery looking in the cabinet . 
these work great ,  arrived quickly ,  and were affordable . 
had them for years now with no problems . 
my husband is very hard to buy for . 
clean up after cool down is easy as the surface just wipes clean . 
and they did a great job designing the assembly process ,  too . 
fits on the smallest of counters ,  and grinds perfectly . 
i tried it out with the lady in the store . 
my other small issue is it s on the smaller side at num_extend
i was pretty iffy on this product before i bought it . 
their products come in a rainbow of colors . 
it s the assemble of functionality you can ever imagine . 
other than forgetting to put the coffee holder back in . 
this is my second oxo utensil purchase; would definately purchase additional oxo products . 
i also dusted the bottom with corn meal . 
the num_extend one had them falling off almost right away . 
i cleaned my bath and shower and overall ,  i was impressed .

a handy tool ,  and i highly recommend it . 
if i can use this ,  anyone can use it .

the medium is the good ,  overall size for most cookies . 
coffee tastes great and you aren t adding to the landfill . 
i have a vita mix for home use . 
love cooking italian and chinese and also makes great fried chicken . 
i also used it for slicing cabbage when i made sauerkraut . 
i don t have to do that and never have these slip around . 
the ear gel isn t intrusive like the old jabras . 
i like oem products ,  particularly when it comes to batteries . 
i purchased this for my lady friends daughter . 
find a corner section to stuff it in if you can . 
there are mandoline slicers ,  some of which more expensive than this one . 
they could have named it the igarlic press . 
this year it broke after filling up one time . 
they are very nice for otherwise messey informal food . 
i have one of my num_num screens dedicated solely for direct dial shortcuts . 
the range though was very good ,  better than i expected . 
overall very satisfied with the product and delivery . 
make enough at one time to last awhile .

i could not believe how hard it is to find an authentic wok . 
overall and nice color and it looks really cute on a white phone . 
this little machine does a fantastic job filtering dust and pollen . 
i m tempted to buy another for our second vehicle .

very useful for me and the strainer is a great addition . 
it fit nicely on the phone and fell good in my hand .

bought this one for my son and his wife .

sorry to say some how he broke the thing . 
beats me ,  but its still great in that everything stays warm enough . 
great i love it !  i had no problems what so ever . 
this headset powers up instantly with the slide of the power switch . 
i highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a case . 
the juicer gets it all out in seconds . 
i ve added a picture to prove my statement in this review . 
the ring on the end could be larger . 
the start button began to get less responsive . 
but that is expected when it only cost about a dollar . 
i opened the package without looking at the instructions . 
the grains of salt will not completely dissolve . 
it holds my ipod classic or my iphone tightly . 
they look great even after washing multiple times and they stay straight .

i recommend this product to protect any john boos board . 
can t wait now ,  as the  fear  of canning is gone . 
this screen is awesome and perfect for my torch . 
this will be my third and last order from panasonic . 
i am very happy with these and would certainly recommend to a friend . 
the case scratches somewhat easily but it is better than scratching your phone . 
i m juicing lemons and i can do num_num or num_num before emptying . 
i would recommend this for a simple fast sandwich . 
the only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong . 
i needed another usb cord works well with my my iphone . 
it seems that these hand vacs are only sold by internet retailers . 
but if you iron a lot ,  buy a full sized board . 
use caution if you try to serve on the bottom of the pan . 
one of the more adjustable to your ear shape headsets . 
this is easily the best car dock i ve used . 
i ve lived without one of these for a very long time . 
this is an interesting and non traditional case . 
provides the support product necessary for best microwave results . 
i actually keep mine in a cupboard ,  rather than on the countertop . 
at this point i wouldn t think of getting these anywhere else . 
it is functional and usable ,  but a pain . 
i recommend this to anyone ,  just remember the aluminum foil bit . 
and it does have a limited internal memory . 
edit from num_extend yrs of use  and bought another one  . 
we got this to replace an older popcorn maker . 
at $ it was not much of a bargain . 
i have also used dishwashing liquid ,  fabuloso , vinegar ,  etc . 
copper bottom tea pots are all but impossible to find in stores . 
my droid pro fits well in this armband . 
nothing a few seconds with a dremel couldn t fix . 
it fits into the cd slot very easily and is very portable . 
even the warranty claims it is for home use only . 
it fits very well on my desk and holds papers perfectly . 
so i bought a pair of kevlar gloves . 
this worked really good on my cell phone . 
great great great product and price !  i love this red color !  . 
not too heavy or clunky for my small hands . 
good product ,  works perfectly in my blackberry num_extend
i got this because it was on the deal of the day . 
i dropped my old carafe ,  and needed a new one . 
they are heavy duty and will last a lifetime . 
the dirt and grease slides right off this bowl . 
i bought these to make my version of egg mcmuffins . 
and she likes  healthy  snacks for her kids . 
it has enough power to really get the dirt out . 
the longer distance is more of an inconvenience than a plus feature . 
i really like this device and recommend it highly . 
a quick honing with the steel each use and they stay frighteningly sharp . 
our daughter now has it and is happy with it . 
the best price i found anywhere was here and ordered one right away . 
but very fun for kids and every shape you can imagine is included . 
all the pieces are labeled and simply snap together . 
i ve had $ whisks that didn t come close in performance . 
and there i found the machine that everybody was talking about . 
no burned fingers removing the whistler as on my old kettle . 
i own this dispenser and find it to be very useful . 
this is my num_extend iphone ,  the fist being the num_extend
and for the money ,  you won t find a better one . 
havent heard any complaints from my mom about it . 
i m sorry we didn t buy these years ago . 
i got it on sale for $ or less ,  can t remember . 
if you have not tried one of these bowls ,  you must !  . 
we ve had a lot of fun and good eating from this machine . 
i hate those things ,  they warp at around num_num f . 
it attaches to the press so you cannot lose it in the drawer . 
this brita works great and we keep full as much as well can . 
everyone loves watching this .  .  . there are some cautions however . 
it also has spell check as part of it s core programming . 
plus you can play music through the ear piece !  !  !  . 
i gave it a  step down  effect ,  which turned out just right . 
first ,  it has a slide switch for power . 
this accessory would be a welcome addition to your winter frost set !  . 
at num_num hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture . 
the good part is ,  it gets better and better . 
two joints in the arm allow for multiple position and orientation adjustments . 
my favorite of all my whisks !  highly recommended . 
the price was very reasonable for such a solid vacuum . 
i d feel a lot better microwaving glass than these plastic tops . 
mine was made in china and i got it at $
i like them a lot ,  they dont tip over easily . 
i ve owned this grill pan for a few years . 
i keep my turntable on another equipment stand . 
microwavable which i appreciate for melting butter and coconut oil together . 
people were always asking me to speak up . 
mine is sitting on carpet ,  and is still fairly sturdy . 
when i was a boy ,  my father ran an appliance store . 
this product is much superior to others i have owned in the past . 
the protector for the front of the iphone was easy to apply . 
the wife and i can both charge our phones using num_num power port . 
but the description says it comes with a lid and it does not . 
still a great deal for two serviceable batteries ,  though . 
at this price point ,  i really recommend the knife !  . 
it s made of brushed  matte  steel and is finger print proof . 
it totally changed my ideas of what was a good steak . 
it uses regular aaa batteries which are just about everywhere . 
it is clear as it says ,  which is just what i wanted . 
but i recommend it for its multiple functions and easy to program . 
very good quality !  my only criticism ,  i wish it were taller . 
i haven t tried to sharpen them as they are still very sharp . 
i also soak the stips in water while i mix up the cake . 
this pizza pan is great if you like a nice ,  crispy crust . 
the bowls that came are the color of french s mustard . 
i couldn t decide which thermos i wanted to purchase . 
her cake baked evenly and looked perfect for the wedding . 
i bought case protection for my wife phone . 
but don t actually try to beat it with anything . 
measurements  metric included as well  are stamped on the handles . 
for what i use them for ,  they work beautifully . 
it will melt where silicon num_num degree tools will not . 
very sharp and well made ,  comfortable to hold . 
i searched around for an extended battery for my evo num_extend
needless to say ,  the threads no longer match . 
this headset gives me exactly what i was looking for . 
these pots are a great buy for the price . 
the easy on and off saves time and frustration . 
the best part is that it is made in the usa !  . 
in fact ,  it connected faster than any headset i d ever used . 
stainless steel is high quality and supposedly healthier than aluminum . 
wow ,  i was so surprised at how well this thing worked . 
i accidently left mine at home recently and felt lost without it . 
they are not as nice but neither do they have the price . 
i contacted kinivo ,  and they were super helpful in resolving the issue . 
easy to hold down with one hand and sharpen with the other . 
but there are two more should i care . 
i can turn the volume up much higher then in my old headset . 
i use two because i really like my wine cold . 
i needed a dinnerware set that was nice ,  simple ,  and affordable . 
the headset is awesome just love the feel and the sound . 
i have also bought many jawbones over the course of num_num years . 
oxo items usually work quite well ,  these did not disappoint . 
we were done slicing a huge bowl of veggies in under num_num minutes . 
i called kitchen aid ,  explained the problem and asked about repair possibilities . 
it will take you back to the days of the old phone handsets . 
it s nice and heavy ,  so they didn t skimp there . 
in reality ,  you can put in more like num_num cups . 
i can really appreciate a company that stands by its products . 
so i use my num_extend as my primary camera . 
thus ,  he counsels ,  you would have to use two separate circuits . 
the xperia play itself is great ,  just i wish battery was better . 
i have also discovered that almond milk works just as well as soymilk . 
much nicer than having a detergent bottle on the counter . 
you don t notice it after just a few minutes . 
great for what they need to be used for . 
the molded ice from these means much faster and quieter snowcone num_extend
it d be an understatement to say i m pleased . 
the micro usb port just seems to be bending a little every time . 
this worked magically to steam fish and veggies . 
i purchased this heater based on all the excellent reviews here on amazon . 
i ve never owned one longer than num_num years . 
seems to block the openings to keep out bugs etc . 
for years and years ,  i avoided buying a cast iron skillet . 
they reheat contents in microwave without a problem . 
i bought this knife based on a recommendation from cook s illustrated . 
you pick if u want the larger holes or smaller . 
this is a beautiful piece ,  and even hand washing is a breeze . 
its nice and does what it has too . 
my original bodum french press beaker had a crack and was thrown away . 
it s light weight  i would prefer it be a little heavier  . 
i just hope i can keep it so sharp !  . 
i like that it doesn t have a cord attached . 
it is of nice quality and the markings are easy to read . 
everything on this oven has been well laid out and thought over . 
being selfish i am keeping it for myself . 
it s too bad there is no cup heater here . 
he also sent num_num gift recipe books which was a nice surprise . 
i was surprised at the quality of this rack for the price . 
these speaker stands ar sturdy ,  functional ,  and unobtrusive . 
overall its a steal for the price and what it offers you . 
i ordered this fryer for my daughter for christmas . 
i was able to replace it for less $
as the other reviewer said ,  necessary to run your floormate . 
it has a rubber outer shell for easy hold and shock absobtion . 
i like this area ,  but even with these helps . 
much better than the handheld sharpeners that i used . 
this small sized frame is perfect for doing crossstitch and embroidery . 
the pans were in good shape and i have baked several cakes already . 
with this container you just flip it over and you are done . 
this is the num_extend one i have purchased . 
one was whole wheat ,  and the other gluten free . 
good quality ,  should have bought a larger one . 
placed it in the microwave and in about num_extend minutes it was done . 
when they arrived i compared them to the much more expensive wacom stylus . 
i remember when my mom used to bake . 
this simple product is getting hard to find . 
the blender has num_num options :  off ,  low ,  and high . 
then ,  just tip it out onto a plate . 
some coffee grinds will still make their way into the coffee pot . 
my only complaint is that sometimes sounds from the right earbudscreech . 
bpa free and easy to snap close and open . 
i looked a long time for this style . 
this case has protective flaps for all the attachments for my iphone . 
great for pot roast and other slow cooking recipes . 
when you first turn this on it smells like mountain air . 
i d let cool down before cleaning to prevent warping . 
so what ?  slap it and get over it . 
i lost a few screws ,  and now i have them . 
they do not come off when i run on the treadmill either . 
we ordered more just because we needed more . 
and some phones i use there still require the old sim cards . 
great to have the extra ear hook clips . 
plus the main filtration is still true hepa on most higher end devices . 
i have had no issues with this charger . 
bottom line it comes down to personal preference . 
the case is a beautiful ,  deep navy color with a white zipper . 
anyway ,  good customer service from the thermos company . 
coffee is so expensive might as well make it taste its best . 
it goes from fridge to microwave  or oven  to dishwasher without any problems . 
after a couple of months of use ,  she is quite pleased . 
much ,  much more stable and meaningful than a food processor . 
again ,  a nitpick . overall ,  a great stand for the evo . 
this allows it to cool down naturally within a reasonable amount of time . 
they were expensive but they did the job for awhile . 
great tool to use for getting my buttercream smooth . 
this is the best george foreman so far . 
they fit the cr gibson cards or your own cards quite well . 
it is a great case for an unbelievable price . 
if you want something that lasts longer ,  definitely ateco . 
it swivels to stay out of your way when you bend or sit . 
the battery life on the phone goes quick ,  so needs regular charging . 
i have only had it a day ,  but it impressed me already . 
no dirty water or mop to deal with . 
it seems to be doing fine so far . 
they have them in all sorts of colors in stores they really expensive . 
it opens any can we ve tried it on without missing a beat . 
that is the only weak spot in this food processors armor . 
however ,  that s what i wanted :  something not easily breakable . 
the sound quality and battery life on this unit are excellent . 
i own both the num_extend and the num_extend and both are great !   . 
the cutter even does a good job on soft or crumbly cheeses . 
the original was no longer available but this new trent num_extend looked great . 
this is better than other egg poachers i have tried . 
i wish i had made this purchase long ago . 
works great ,  looks even better on the while i phone . 
i was amazed at how fine it could shred the lettuce . 
i bought num_num  one for my mom ,  sister and myself  . 
charging speed does not diminish as the powergen runs down . 
i bought it mostly because it is black . 
it works well for hanging on our bathroom door . 
these would be great if you have younger children in your house . 
the nouveau is beautiful in the package and on the table . 
so far we are very pleased with this bread maker . 
i was excited about getting a compost keeper with a lid . 
needed my red onions sliced thinner and this does the trick . 
i can use it for other things as well . 
now my daughter is the proud owner of this old kitchen aid mixer . 
if it were $ cheaper i would have given it num_num stars . 
they make getting the way back contents of those base cabinets much easier . 
had to replace our coffee percolator for our grand canyon camping trip . 
i like the double connection to two blue tooth electroncis . 
construction is sturdy and is relatively light weight . 
i told my friends and they ordered cases as well . 
my only regret is not buying it sooner . 
the handle is really great because of its texture . 
it is nice and heavy and spreads the heat well . 
they are typical kitchenaid quality; well built and sturdy . 
its i great purchase for protection of my phone . 
i ll update if they somehow have a glitchy connection . 
i chose this one because of the amazing price . 
i dont know why so many reviews say the lids dont fit . 
much better than anything you d by in the dollar store . 
i learned my lesson buying a discounted lightning cable from others . 
i prefer more simple chopsticks ,  like the disposable ones . 
here are some of its num_extend very well made . 
then it would take longer to do it all . 
i love everything about my miracle balde knives . 
worked like a charm and just the right size for the dinner . 
if you re looking for an inexpensive ,  dependable blender . 
replaced a case with kickstand that turned out to be useless . 
they are made well and should last a long time . 
it s a bit tough to open ,  but it works . 
i have owned these for about num_num years and they re still kicking . 
feet should be more rubbery to stick better . 
works as promised right out of the box . 
it s compact design fits easily in the refrigerator yet holds a lot . 
its impossible to find a replacement so this was a good deal . 
that one comes with a glass lid and sturdier handles . 
i use it to cool down jello when making a raspberry mousse . 
i have had these for over a year . 
good little espresso maker after it finally started to draw water . 
it works really well and it is easy to clean . 
i know how to care for these pans and how to use them . 
it works great for this and takes no time at all doing it . 
i still ,  struggle at times ,  hearing the caller . 
it worked perfectly on my nokia lumia num_num screen replacement . 
it s easy to use once you get the hang of it . 
nice feel and good weight to the case . 
fits in the hand well and cuts like a dream . 
the chrome matches the shower rod well and i would purchase them again . 
also ,  they could increase the capacity to num_extend
the voice alerts that tell you battery life and connection are great . 
i usually season the chicken with a rub . 
this is a good case for the money . 
i was skeptical about this product when i was buying . 
it gets darker the more you use it . 
everything good to me expect the feel of the surface . 
so i guess it s num_num ++ and to me that equals a num_extend
they definitely appear to be more expensive than they actually are . 
i just wish they had said the cover was different on newer machines . 
i give it a hearty  thumbs up  rheba . 
i ve tried some popcorn seasonings sold on amazon and really enjoy them . 
this is a huge feature that i d almost given up num_extend
we have an older model at home and use almost daily . 
pesto stays bright green and fresh for days . 
now ,  i use it at least once a week . 
you then turn it on and select the settings you want . 
but i have no complaints and highly recommend the item !  . 
keep that in mind when it comes to power . 
these seem like a great set of measuring spoons . 
the heat lets the butter penetrate a bit . 
again this flatware feels wonderful in your hand . 
i suspect it will last me many years . 
so i wanted another pack for myself but marshalls ran out of them . 
i will let you know if i do . enjoy . jb . 
i own two ,  and have friends who bight it on my recommendation . 
my kids want sets of their own for when they move out . 
unlike calphalon cookware ,  it can go in the dishwasher . 
the sound quality is fine but the microphone is poor . 
it arrived earlier than expected and that was an added bonus . 
cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor . 
tremontina type stainless steel spreads heat quickly and evenly . 
works well on the back of a door in the bathroom . 
this item works perfectly for my iphone num_extend when used without a case . 
this cheese knife is superior to all i have seen . 
i got the screw i wanted and i just put away the rest . 
box was not taped to protect product from falling out . 
everything cooks great and i love the soft grip handles . 
also i can add a little salt and have flavored salts . 
another gripe about this phone i ve heard was its screen . 
i would recommend this product to a friend . 
a plus is that it will gather a crowd when you use it . 
there is a learning curve on using this press . 
this case very closely resembles the amzer case . 
take the time to follow them correctly to get really good results . 
the stamped measurements will last and won t disappear after numerous washings . 
it has worked well for us and was fairly easy to install . 
what a difference between these and my old set . 
must have if you have an iphone num_extend
i ve been searching around and landed on this product . 
finally it now gets hot and stays hot . 
we made two more loaves that evening for lunch s the next day . 
but then i decided to look online and these drawer dividers worked perfectly . 
no matter what brand ,  perked coffee is the best . 
i m disappoint in samsung for their shortcoming with the update . 
yes ,  the math is fine ,  i have two . 
there is really no reason for anyone to use anything else . 
however ,  i ve had problems with them toasting evenly . 
i hope i can keep buying these for years to come . 
all she wanted for her num_extend birthday was this set . 
i copped some dope pyrex because yeezy told me to . 
they are very quiet when running num_extend and require very little maintenance . 
this new stylus works just fine with compatible machines . 
i have also been making fruit  coffee cakes  for breakfast . 
i called motorola just sent me a new one . 
and it s small enough to leave on the counter all the time . 
one night ,  i decided to fry chicken for supper . 
i have used it with the cup and on the wood cutting board . 
i got this as a base for catan and for dominion . 
i filled and sealed num_num jars and had no problems . 
i got this one cheap so i wasn t expecting much from it . 
but i can see it being the most used tool in my kitchen . 
a well worth addition to any house hold . 
what is cool is you could go to different countries . 
it s a gamble each time i need to use it . 
saw them here ,  knew i d use them ,  got  em . 
i got the num_num and num_num inch versions of this pan . 
i don t mind it because it is very minimal . 
otterbox is quick to send a replacement for that problem . 
this seems a good avenue for customer service . 
found to reset time just hold both minute and second buttons down . 
i could control what i put on it . 
within an hour on the plane ,  the ipod was almost fully charged . 
this is the best pot i have ever purchase . 
seem to be a good strong goblet too . 
this case has been a very good one for my iphone num_extend
the only beef i have is that obscene motorola logo . 
nice smooth coffee obviously attributed to the filter  and decent coffee  . 
this was a present for my nephew when he first got his iphone num_extend
i keep these on hand as we use the brita pitcher daily . 
oxo makes good quality items ,  and this one is quite useful . 
i have a new puppy and he is the ultimate steam cleaner test . 
much better price than from the local hardware store . 
it is easy to clean ,  easy to store . 
the coffee stays really piping hot for a good six hours . 
great price and i will be buying again and again . 
it took about a month to receive them in the mail . 
i ordered this because of a review in cooks magazine . 
may be the only chef knife you will ever need . 
these things have great distant too ,  about num_num feet or so . 
this is a num_num star case ,  what else needs to be said . 
just a little note this is not a native union phone . 
bought this set to start my wusthof knife set . 
other than that ,  a good value for the money . 
this particular product went to a household on the other side of town . 
i always recommend them to my friends and family . 
can easily handle even the num_num gallon size . 
the phone comes with some  relatively small  amount of internal memory . 
the phone seems to very durable although i wouldn t drop it . 
it comes with a nice plastic protective sleeve to store it in . 
struggling to cut these wonderful breads was always a nightmare . 
but other than that it gets the job done . 
i was pleasantly surprised how sturdy this rack is . 
i like using this to melt butter on my stove versus the microwave . 
i bought num_extend one for me and num_num for gifts . 
before i found this gadget life for me was different . 
the funnel on this set is much larger at the top . 
always use this for simple syrup ,  for meringue making . 
nothing better for full protection of your $ phone . 
this is heavier duty than my old one . 
comfort could be a problem if you use it constantly . 
what more can i say about shower curtain rings . 
i was looking for some nice accessories to my inherited mixer . 
i ordered them hoping to match a pantry piece to the exact shade . 
we are both very happy with it ,  works like new . 
the review is based on my own tests . 
it was a very pretty light silver color . 
this will take two or more unpeeled garlic cloves at a time . 
it is small and does not take much room on the counter . 
i used to buy tortillas in the store . 
i ve dropped it ,  cracked it ,  and it still works great . 
when using the iems  in ear monitors  this feature is very nice . 
i went with them for the lower cost comprehensive plans . 
while that s true ,  i ve never had any difficulty cleaning it . 
otherwise i like the look and feel and ease of installation . 
it s heavy stainless steel has proven to be durable . 
i have tried several others ,  including other plantronics . 
definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have . 
i ve always bought wilton s disposable bags until recently . 
i d recommend it and worth the price paid . 
perfect size and a great addition to my fiestaware collection . 
huge upgrade for me to a smart phone . 
i bought this to carry around my mobile hotspot and charger . 
especially since it does not line up with most normal stud spacing . 
great weight and quality ,  bake perfectly and easy to clean . 
the inside usable space is num_extend x num_extend
works really good driving down the road hands free now . 
plus ,  the results are better than a conventional steam iron . 
i ve had it a few weeks now and so far so good . 
it also washes up well in the dishwasher . 
these look exactly like oem chargers and cables . 
this is one appliance i will never be without . 
the awesome battery life is worth it though . 
i needed some large bag clips and wanted them in red . 
was worried that these would not be electrolux brand but they are . 
you have to use these filters for the chemex . 
hello all i received these headphones not know what to expect . 
i gave in and purchased one ,  and was quickly disappointed . 
the surface area is large enough to grill two burgers at a time . 
this worked so well for me that i bought two more . 
i tried cooking beef and almost got beef soup . 
the same thing happens with carrots and potatoes . 
ok ,  i just used this for the first time this morning . 
the cusinart was on sale and seemed to be adequate . 
it is so much less work to chop and slice large vegetables . 
nice and study for what i paid for it . 
i have dropped several times but not dents or cracks so far . 
the pancakes did not stick to the pan even on the num_extend pancake . 
but the iphone num_extend it works wonders on . 
many negative reviews about the cables on amazon so leery about buying them . 
the only thing i do not like is the heavy weight . 
i used the plastic model for many years and loved it . 
making whipped cream can be a messy business . 
place on a counter that has cold water ,  or any water on num_extend
this is by far the most used tool in my kitchen . 
i d previously purchased the motorola num_extend which worked great . 
the recipe is good too but too much work and far too costly . 
first is the claim that the smaller pots make better coffee . 
these shelves do exactly what they re supposed to . 
for the price it is hard to beat . 
canister vacuum cleaners come in the $ to the $ range . 
this design was the sturdiest of them all . 
we leave it on num_extend for most of the stuff we toast . 
he watches the occasional show or plays a couple of games . 
it is definitely appropriately priced for the design . 
these are the perfect size for real english muffins . 
fiestaware pieces don t have to be all the same color . 
you don t need to worry about that with this set . 
it does everything they say it does ,  and does it well . 
the color and shape is consistent throughout the pieces . 
other than that ,  i am really pleased with this purchase . 
otterbox brand is a one of a kind . 
they are extremely solid and very heavy stainless steel . 
it is easy to hold and pretty comfortable in the hand . 
our num_num year old used this during a family vacation . 
the more you use it ,  the better it gets . 
my son has been begging for this for num_num years . 
it s all in the length of time in micro . 
this is a great fast single coffee maker . 
there was not tracking number so that sucked . 
i use these on jars to store my dehydrated goods . 
these are sturdy dishes that do not typically break . 
it does work for my sandisk sansa num_extend player . 
so tedious on most phones ,  and something i always dread . 
my husband and i are both very happy with this purchase . 
however i got a different color stylus which was actually nicer . 
don t expect to ride this thing around like a go cart . 
audio quality is great ,  and people hear me well . 
this pot is large enough to hold enough food for a num_extend
and it works like a charm for that too . 
my son loved it ,  it matched the decor of his house perfectly . 
i checked the signal on the roof with my galaxy using settings>about phone>status . 
after some simple instructions ,  you ll be connected in no time . 
if you re looking for a flexible spatula ,  this one is great . 
i second the recommendation that you use bunn num_extend filters with this unit . 
these are infinitely better than my old loaf pans . 
this is a good basic bundt pan at an extraordinarily good price . 
i ve used it for biscuits ,  shortcake ,  cookies ,  etc . 
just follow the directions and this waffle iron works wonderful . 
you can t just hone it on an average steel . 
the plug hogs are always reluctant to give up their territory . 
everything comes out beautifully and looks almost to pretty to eat . 
perfect !  no leaks and i find it easier to use . 
nice soft rubber for a good feel and protection . 
it is on the cord just below the right ear headphone . 
my grandfather made italian sausageand sold same in his deli . 
it is a good size and a very pretty lemongrass green color . 
both sides are indented equally to allow for corn knobs . 
they are heavy ,  beautifully detailed ,  and cork bottomed . 
i use it when i take a shower . 
my old bowl broke an i replaced it im ediately with this one . 
the pot is double walled and keeps the coffee hot a long num_extend
there are many blue tooth headsets but most project into the ear canal . 
the clear plastic bowl can t be handled too roughly . 
apple sells similar products for $ awesome deal !  . 
crispy bacon with no frying pan ,  hard to clean messes . 
having been happy with other amazonbasics cables ,  i gave these a try . 
this relatively large ,  shallow serving bowl is perfect for everyday serving . 
it holds the phone quite firmly which is nice . 
it was unusable so we placed it without hesitation . 
i also have a smaller  different brand  one that also works well . 
i have replaced the glass from accidents about every two years . 
the phone still feel sleek and slim and light . 
i baked num_num  half inch  layers to make a praline doberge cake . 
works great for holding up my phone while charging . 
i bought the one gallon size for a terrarium . 
the only one i don t like is the magnet on a stick . 
the grilling panels and the drain cup come completely out for easy cleaning . 
keeping good knives ultra sharp with this steel is a breeze . 
only bc he drops his phone all the time . 
while i am away ,  it turns on the fan automatically as needed . 
the code was num_extend and is good until may num_extend num_extend
i was amazed at how fast my carpet dried . 
and have not had problems with them peeling . 
there s a straight blade and one that has slight serrations for stability . 
we enjoyed it ,  but it might be too bittersweet for kids . 
this style of lifter works better for me . 
now from % it will only take my phone to % very quickly . 
i bought a grill that didn t have a place for the tools . 
alas ,  i couldn t see paying $ more for just that feature . 
i was sent the case pictured ,  unlike others from reading the reviews . 
the lettuce is kept perfectly crisp and fresh . 
fits my cupboard ,  everything works ,  stainless steel ,  even heating . 
am i insane ?  perhaps foolish might be a better term . 
it fits the iphone num_num like a glove and is perfect . 
it is very powerful and charges my android phone and ipad quickly . 
this is what i d call a  full coverage  set . 
the quality of bags is comparable to the price . 
this carver is as sharp as any expensive knife that sells for over $
it was an upgrade to our old handheld mixer . 
i love the count up timer for this num_extend
they add color to the pics and work great . 
i just wanted to update and say this is well worth the money . 
they arrived within the correct time as i am a prime member . 
this is the best thermos i have ever owned . 
num_num days with light usage and charges in a little over num_num hrs . 
i think this is a staple in every kitchen . 
now i love my icon and use it all the time . 
i have used it quite often and have not experienced any warping . 
the price was great ,  and it came promptly . 
so ,  we added additional sets to our wedding registry . 
it is very sturdy and will last forever . 
and with the level of crispness and thickness that one wants . 
but we also use it for other foods . 
it does not collect lint like other rubbery backed cases . 
i learned when i first washed the blades and sliced my finger deeply . 
it gives my phone a really good appearance and feel . 
i also plan on bringing this griddle with me when camping this summer . 
oversized metal hooks will fit most conventional hanging rods . 
maintains a proper simmer on the lowest setting on my gas range . 
do not wash in dishwaser or soak in water . 
an extra  flick  of the handle and the cookie popped right out . 
wish they could get better battery life without such a big battery . 
items it would be cheaper to replace than repair . 
i need more practice using it to frost a cake evenly . 
i wish i had this whisk years ago . 
it can stand up ,  while charging and play my music . 
i estimate these will hold around num_num big vitamins . 
this speaker sounds great ,  and has a good battery life . 
works great ,  wasn t extremely expensive ,  and seems very well made . 
i love the feel and the design of it . 
i bought is for my devices while i m driving . 
i wash the carafe by hand because it s quick and easy . 
this speaker works great with the iphone num_extend
other reviews said the unit was imprecise and brewed inconsistent cups of coffee . 
i can shake my head violently and it does t come out . 
i m considering the purchase of a second one at this time . 
they kept slipping down and felt a bit big on my head . 
without much force at all they do give . 
the warmer the weather the higher it pushes up . 
they will replace any product or part you feel is defective . 
made bacon and french toast this morning with great results . 
i used them to make fruit roll ups in my dehydrator . 
i have had several humidifiers over the years . 
i like it much better than the num_extend i am currently using . 
my wife can squeeze num_num medium pancakes on it simultaneously . 
it really stays with the form of the bowl or pan . 
i suppose it would add a couple bucks to the price . 
and the blade needs to come off to get the bowl off . 
this is a perfect size pan for one and it is beautiful . 
doing so can cause small pinholes that will prevent an effective vacuum . 
if you re serious about your popcorn ,  this is an affordable choice . 
i love how simple and easy it is to use . 
i had no problems keeping it in my pants num_extend
i would recommend this coffee maker to other . 
i am lifetime fan and will continue to add to my calphlon collection . 
exceed quoted use time per charge x num_num or more . 
they screw on nicely ,  and do their job keeping the product fresh . 
usually it is the most fibrous bits you do not want anyway . 
the edges of the swirls are crisp and clean . 
great for chopping smaller amount of veggies and stuff . 
a very pretty dish ,  it serves my purposes well . 
it also flawlessly blends soups ,  even spinach soup . 
best case of three different cases i ve ordered . 
she also commented that really didn t bother her though . 
takes off just the right amount of peel with each swipe . 
due to a disability ,  i was constantly dropping my phone . 
they last for ever and work every time . 
this is going be a definate to stay in my bag . 
i will be buying another one for chicken . 
it is a bit larger so make space to store it . 
this allows me to add another num_num inches to my bath depth . 
i m glad i did because i saved about %
it is pretty sturdy and can hold a decent amount of books . 
they should better inform customers about these things . 
overall ,  i would definitely purchase again and i recommend this product . 
i bought num_num and may be buying a few more . 
i told my mom that he needed a protective case asap . 
i had ordered the larger version of this product and loved it . 
they just haven t replaced the old picture with the new one . 
nice looking  industrial looking though  and well functioning . 
the handle seems solidly attached ,  haven t had any problems with it . 
it was a fair price and i love oxo brand items anyway ,  . 
  like they apparently have with their great blender num_extend
the covers fit securely so your foods are kept fresh longer . 
the top is soft plastic ,  for which degassing may be a concern . 
and by the way :  clean up is a snap !  . 
don t tap the funnel against anything to get the grounds out . 
it s a nice weight and it sits flat on the burner . 
nothing wrong with this unless you want something longer . 
well pacakaged and no damages of any kind . 
the pans are meant for baking and not for storage . 
after using the last filter it was time to buy more . 
this is a great preseasoned cast iron skillet . 
oh but my cornbread sure taste good when baked in my iron skillet . 
we juice just about everything from pineapple to oranges to wheatgrass . 
i have the nexus s num_extend  sprint  fits fine except for power button . 
many of these are based on the status of your call . 
i used it the next time to shred cheese . 
he used it everyday it s simply a good produce . 
i have found that this blender does just that . 
so let me say ,  this coffee maker rocks !  . 
defiantly will buy again if i ever need it again . 
to my delight , it does fit and i am so happy . 
the smaller ones just aren t big enough for more than one person . 
i bought the rezound because the screen is beautiful . 
she would rather use foil and spray pam on it . 
i never dreamed any small appliance could be this great . 
this product is exceptional to say the least . 
this is a nice looking piece that works well . 
mine has been in use for nearly num_num years . 
use this tool to quickly skim off the bulk of the scum . 
i have had this pan for over a year . 
works great and makes it easier to cut for my num_num yr old . 
it seems a bit flimsy ,  but once mounted it is relatively solid . 
it works as advertised ,  but the suction cup fails a lot . 
pick up a set you will not be disappointed . 
i am so glad to have found these caps . 
the price is a bargain given all the advantages . 
you don t have to use all num_num panels ,  either . 
it fits nicely in its carrier ,  making it easy to transport . 
mom always cooked things in as healthy manner as possible . 
the case is sturdy and i am all man . 
it does a great job of it to . 
i bought my thermometer for help when cooking meat in the oven . 
very good feel for the product ,  works amazingly . 
i was leary about purchasing the battery because it cost so little . 
i ve tried other brands ,  which were not as durable . 
so i bought another ,  and now i have two  best knives  . 
there is no removeable inner crock which makes it difficult to clean . 
this pyrex set is great and the sizes are perfect for anything . 
i also like to add a little cocoa powder on top;  . 
nothing beats quality !  this is a pizza pan of the highest quality . 
i was a bit skeptical of all these glowing reviews . 
i think i care about the roomba more . 
it may totally be operator error  again ,  i am new to baking  . 
makes wonderful coffee ,  and isn t too bad to clean . 
switch off little inconvenient to use when it is on your ear . 
i just got this vacuum cleaner after reading the other reviews for it . 
dishwasher safe with no darkening in the metal parts . 
i just hope it s healthy and it will get better in time . 
these were the exact round ones i was looking for !  . 
i never thought the more expensive brands would produce a noticeable difference . 
the rubber base is also a cover for the processor container . 
mine arrived in perfect shape ,  no scratches or cracks . 
don t usually have anything else to do while food is cooking . 
this is a great product as all fiesta ware products are . 
but the best thing is the removable grill plates . 
the product feels absolutely cheap as though its going to fall apart . 
another phone had a slide mechanism with a metal holder . 
dressey and bright ,  a real joy to have on the kitchen table . 
you must grab hold of the cord and find the volume control . 
it s hard to imagine a better screen protector for my iphone . 
so if you need this item get it !  . 
first ,  it s heavy enough to keep eggs from scorching . 
these are the only curtains i will use from now on . 
i ve not needed to replace the silicone seal yet . 
considering the price and results of this product it is a bargain . 
 he had a stroke num_num years ago at the age of num_extend
these are a great pair of kitchen shears for the price . 
when wearing the headset ,  the mic hangs near my cheek . 
nothing like my old aluminum pressure cooker i had num_num years ago . 
bedbathandbeyond is num_extend the price for the same pi model . 
stuff you may never use in your entire time having the phone . 
look for the num_num inch utility knife first . 
i have had a kitchenaid mixer for over num_num years . 
i cant imagine getting this and not being thrilled !  . 
this is the best mesh strainer i have . 
i purchased so i could grill indoors during the winter months . 
food stays so much fresh and for so much longer . 
the volume is not an issue ,  this unit gets plenty loud . 
i m using this with an older mot num_extend
the size and price were perfect and the quality is high . 
there were so many parts to clean ,  and so difficult to clean . 
the cut out is there if you want it . 
yes ,  the metal exterior gets hot but anyone should expect that . 
i tried cleaning the mic but it didn t help . 
i picked this model based on the reviews . 
i requested a replacement ,  and got it in num_num days . 
you would never know kids ,  grandkids ,  cat and dog lived here . 
i love my case !  it is flashy and stylish . 
this is great for small blocks of cheese . 
seasoned salt added to the final finished product will give some flavor . 
this is a great price for a nice glass pyrex measuring cup . 
i can t wait to take this on vacation with me . 
i have a large set of cutco knives and love my cutco . 
i don t use the stainless skillet; i prefer cast iron . 
it s not like all cheese graters are quite different from each other . 
unless you wear your phone ,  signal breaks up num_extend
so many manufacturers put the serrations on the left side of the knife . 
i gave this one to my son ,  because his hot shot broke . 
the only limitation is that it works only fair in the sunlight . 
the quality and comfort are just fine without it extended . 
they accept most spice bottles and hold them firmly . 
just visited him and had a chance to use these lovely glasses . 
this is excellent for processing and sectioning chickens . 
i run with my phone so i needed this for workouts . 
the coating is nice and makes for an easy cleanup . 
i use num_num even soup spoons of coffee . 
but this is an advantage for much cooking . 
i love how it retracts to save space . 
i get the best results with num_num or num_num regular teabags . 
i ordered this for a friend who loves hello kitty . 
the pepper shaker had defective threads and the cover would not tighten . 
the case is a vibrant snow white ,  and is tough . 
well worth it for the price compared to everywhere else . 
this is a well made ,  form fitting cellphone case . 
it was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine . 
so the wife kept griping that i was leaving my hats laying around . 
the say you can use them in the oven . 
plus it comes with an instructional dvd and a recipe book . 
i haven t had a deep fryer in many years . 
the trudeau sprays even better at a much lower cost . 
people and cats come in and out that door with great frequency . 
for the price i was not expecting much . 
considering the price ,  this is well worth the money . 
stirrer makes things a bit easier than those without the feature . 
it s long and not your typical short iphone cord . 
during those two years ,  i lost my headphones several times . 
out of the oven ,  it unmolds the cake like a breeze . 
it is what i needed to protect my tracfone from scratches and etc . 
other filers are like charnim to me now . 
i have not used the rotisserie function yet . 
no more flare up as with my older gas grill . 
even came with t mobile printed on the side . 
voila ,  a tasty dinner for num_extend with leftovers for lunch . 
you have to pair it every time you get in the car . 
i purchased three of these pans a couple of years ago . 
very easy to clean and they don t take up much space . 
these are the perfect size for cereal and nice quality . 
these do what they say they will do . 
before buying this product ,  i used an apple corer and divider . 
received this pan today and could hardly wait to cook a ribeye steak . 
getting it in place while peeling the protective layer is finicky work . 
cases like these are very tight fitting to begin with . 
it s so light ,  you pretty much forget you have it on . 
this unit is exceedingly powerful but noisy  rushing air  on its highest setting . 
this is a great set to have for storage of food !  . 
this machine is the best path to success . 
but i mostly use it to make awesome french toast . 
cleanup was easy after some soaking with warm soapy water . 
i even cooked meatloaf last night and used it to check the temp . 
great for the price and so far seem to be pretty good quality . 
i have not had that issue and nothing is sticking to it . 
it tends to last the longest after getting under %
it does add weight to the phone but its not unbearable . 
along with the little dark walnut coaster holder . 
i am very pleased with my silicone mat . 
i don t know how i ever lived without this product . 
i ve had other bluetooth stereo headphones from sony ,  motorola and plantronics . 
it may only light up when the filter needs to be replaced . 
very pleased and would recommend it to my friends . 
i made dutch pancakes in it and they came out just perfect . 
i purchased two of these for my freezer . 
if you do ,  then factory reset your clipper afterward . 
it works without having to squeeze the handles . 
seem to be a good choice ,  especially for the money . 
great charger !  this charger works perfectly and came exactly as described . 
the pan was recommended to me by a cooking instructor . 
no odor from it either ,  which another reviewer had mentioned . 
both pepper mills hold quite a bit of peppercorns . 
wish there was at least one battery case for this . 
i used very hot water like many of the reviewers here suggested . 
he could not wait to put them on and show them off . 
i m very pleased with this bowl . an epicurean bon appetite . 
it is a useful device rather than a fun device . 
i may order another one for soup cans in the pantry . 
it looks less purple in person and more of a magenta color . 
i use these pyrex round storage containers constantly . 
but other than the size issue ,  it performs beautifully . 
somehow i obtained a steak knife from someone . 
i used these baking cups for my daughters num_extend birthday . 
a baseplate is included for speakers that have mounting holes in the bottom . 
i would like to decide on my own . 
soft edges so they don t scratch up the cookware too much . 
love the fact they can go in dishwasher . 
i like this product a lot and it really work well . 
the tip of my thumb is healing well . 
i have made three batches of mozzarella and one of ricotta . 
awesomeness  . it sticks to our stainless steel sink fine . 
this product accurately and clearly displays the oven temperature . 
i bought this car charger for my wife s samsung moment . 
sunbeam can t hold a light to this ka . 
i love that it sits outside the ear and is very comfortable . 
great that you can charge num_num items at once if necessary . 
i purchased this for my new evo num_extend recently . 
is by far the best battery backup that i ve used to date . 
this is a huge space saver in the freezer . 
it is not heavy ,  yet presses very well . 
i purchased my verizon iphone num_num the day that it launched . 
love this machine ,  had one previously then tried newer models . 
now ,  we don t have to use foil to cover the pans . 
it is not any louder than my old blade grinder . 
many a wine have been enjoyed thanks to this guy . 
the lock works good and smoothly  , seems durable . 
that whisk broke after about num_num months of use . 
curves are all in the right places  no humps like the droid x  . 
i wanted a device to play music from my droid in my truck . 
this gadget has really hooked us on popcorn as a snack . 
i ve mostly put small servings of vegetables in it . 
my carpets are completely dry within a couple of hours . 
still fits in the belt case that i was previously using . 
the spatula is the right size and it does the job very well . 
i would imagine it would be great for making carrot salad too . 
i think its great that companies like this still exist . 
i have even used it on broken corks in champagne bottles . 
it allows room for charging cords and headphone cords . 
these cheap plastic whatzits really improved my messy knife drawer . 
professional or not ,  if you cook ,  you need this . 
have been using this for a few months now and no complaints . 
i can t believe no one has reviewed this product yet . 
i wish i had purchased this measuring cup a year ago . 
plug in the little dipper when you first awaken . 
it will add extra features to the device . 
this is motorola s phone designed for emerging markets . 
i love the buttery cookie dough and then making different shaped cookies . 
this cast iron allows higher heat and non stick . 
the cheap knives turned out pretty good for it s value . 
after num_extend hours ,  my smoothie is very very cold . 
i would highly recommend this food processor to others . 
it is still holding up well  better that the factory battery  . 
i love this pan and use it all of the time . 
i love this item sooooo much !  it has yet to disappoint . 
the styling is excellent ,  as is usual with oxo products . 
seems to be a really nice quality screen protector . 
fastest download i got was num_extend in yellowstone  old faithful  . 
my husband wants to get a second one . 
the stains on the plastic insert and the glass make tea taste better . 
this item serves its purpose and gets the job done . 
i tendto hear that sound when speaking with girls . 
you can use this for skype ,  games ,  music ,  etc . 
so i am limited to verizon as long as i work downtown . 
this little chopper is ideal for the small jobs i want to do . 
red and black ,  two colors that go with anything . 
this is a very nice serrated paring knife . 
the blade is just long enough to make fine knife work easy . 
it was truly beautiful ,  and even more stunning after the raspberry glaze . 
we would recommend it as a great gift . 
and this one is nice and sturdy and easy to use . 
but that gripe aside ,  it really is a top ranking mobile unit . 
many of our glasses have gotten etched in the dishwasher . 
yup ,  this was the right one for my blender . 
it is a really good case and very thin . 
i just rinse it off when done  easy for quick weeknight dinners  . 
i have used several times already and i am very pleased . 
but ill give this the benefit of the doubt and say . 
when i switched back to my official apple usb cables problems were gone . 
i ve been raised on the  trust but verify  rule . 
i make sure never to let it dry on . 
every home with a clothes dryer should have one . 
it lasts; my mother has num_num people at home who constantly use it . 
i use it to make my butter so it gets a workout . 
it s even better than i could have imagined . 
very ergonomic ,  easily dishwashable and just perfect fit !  . 
this is one of the few things that actually make life easier . 
it goes through all my vegetables so far without any problem . 
this is not due to the quality of this machine . 
i use a wooden cutting board and can now chop almost anything . 
it cooked a chicken in about num_num min . 
this was exactly what i was looking for in a car mount . 
currently ,  this is my favorite blue tooth device . 
i had a blackberry curve num_num cellphone on squaretrade warranty that needed repair . 
for this item they are stable and durable . 
i ve had several good quality ,  functional ,  boring ones .

super nice guy who tried hard to make it right . 
i have num_num long haired cats who shed like crazy . 
it has multiple uses ,  and a must have in any kitchen . 
i would still order from this vendor again !  !  . 
they block out the noise around you better than i expected . 
if you love your wife ,  you ll wash her dishes . 
but a great product ,  no problem in closing the cover either . 
you never know when its  on  or  off  . 
my only beef is that cases becomes very difficult to find . 
i like the feel and weight of these . 
one look at this beauty and you can see the workmanship and quality . 
got the new set and the big one was intact . 
i use it according to the direction without any oil . 
easy to install and they stay in place . 
i was up and running in num_num minutes . 
it makes it hard to navigate through the paragraph i m typing . 
very strong and holds quite a few items . 
gets old faster then the over priced ones but was great . 
so this little number is perfect for someone like me . 
very good sounding both ways but not usable in num_num wheeler . 
just spoon it into the basket and seal . 
it stands like a piece of art at the corner . 
was easy to apply ,  and has held up nicely . 
the two clips on each side are not strong enough . 
the motor doesn t seem to work hard at all . 
i was skeptical ,  but these do actually work . 
it s a great cleaner ,  and i would recommend this item . 
the quality seems consistent with the farberware brand . 
this is the kit to unleash the functionality of the kitchenaid mixers . 
i actually have the red model with num_num freezer inserts . 
i feel like i got a new phone . 
great filter and much more cost effective and nicer to use than paper . 
also you can still see the cool finish of the phone . 
i keep all my kitchenaid utensils and wooden spoons etc . 
i m going to buy several more sets to give to my daughters . 
a number of oxo items have broken under our care . 
this is a good product and works well . 
but this old guy wouldn t cut the paper without some concentrated effort . 
the dog has ran off with it several times yet it remains undamaged . 
i think that is pretty typical for these though . 
she loves the easy on and off mic button . 
took screen shots or loaded powerpoints and just scribbled everywhere . 
other then that it was a good product . 
doubling the size of said buttons would be a great thing . 
i thoroughly wash the plates and clean the catch tray . 
boils water quickly ,  easy to pour ,  easy to measure . 
if you have any curiocity about cheese making you shoud get this kit . 
the fluted bases makes it easy to hold even when wet . 
i have absolutely no complaints about his case . 
this egg poacher has nifty little insulated handles on each cup . 
 bread knife ,  and paring knife are the other two .   . 
the control panel is huge and very attractive and functional . 
i do wish this headset had more available settings for low volume . 
there is some serious magnet power in this rack . 
texting and messaging through siri works pretty good also . 
that would be the only change i would make . 
you can always count on pyrex for quality . 
the long arms are great for the barbecue pit and very strong . 
works as advertised ,  as a dish brush that is . 
i ve had them for a few years now . 
it may take several days for it to dry . 
it only takes about an hour to brew your own masterpiece . 
it is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones . 
i ve burnt the cuff on mine more than once . 
great product that i would recommend to everyone .

it s small so you can keep it handy in the knife drawer . 
i love it ,  and would recommend it to anyone . 
just love it and may order a second . 
this gold tone coffee filter works great for me . 
this set is comparable to others that cost num_num times as much . 
the whole exterior has an attractive mirror polish . 
i use it for decaf while my husband drinks caffeinated coffee . 
it cleans easily and cooks everything to perfection . 
this baby will last a long ,  long time if not forever . 
really ,  the entire process took under five minutes from start to finish . 
i m planning on getting diff brand just for kicks . 
i just recommend they put instructions along with it . 
it s a great machine ,  but not worth it fr small jobs . 
it pulls cool air in ,  bringing down the temperature of the house . 
the green light means all systems are go . 
the drop leaf is very handy ,  nice to have . 
another advantage is the numbers are imprinted in the metal making them permanent . 
kept the juices better than on the grill . 
just a few drops of essential oil will do . 
not bad for something that costs slightly more than num_num smackeroos !  . 
it surprised me on how hot my coffee remained even after num_num hours . 
my wife called she was going to be num_num min late . 
well worth the money and i will use it often . 
it should have a secure handle on it . 
and ,  you can vacuum your car with this too . 
corning ware ,  so well made ,  and microwaveable including the tops . 
the only negative is i wish there was a longer cord . 
the bonjour unit has lots of power ,  and runs smoothly . 
the display is cool and the sliding touch volume control is very cool . 
i put butter and garlic in the warmer and everyone loved them . 
i don t really like the sliver piece but it is still cute . 
i would definitely recommend this case and seller to others !  . 
tried chopping almonds and did a great job . 
i really like this num_num cup food chopper . 
bought this to charge a spare battery i bought for my blackberry num_extend
really like the deep bowls on them ,  too . 
i love the look ,  feel ,  and function of the global knives . 
i now use this french press more than my metal screen filter . 
she is tall ,  and outgrew the pack  n play awhile back . 
overall it s a nice dispenser and i d buy it again . 
i bought this product almost a year and a half ago . 
many a plastic baster has demised in the preparation of this dish . 
there are all kinds of tools to do all kinds of jobs . 
i like the pan so much ,  i ordered a second one . 
the bormioli rocco kufra jug does just that . 
but this is how you cook all rice isn t it ?  . 
steer clear of the cheap mantra pressure cookers sold in target . 
but the knife sharpener works very well too . 
although ,  that it could be it s downside too . 
it s compact and doesn t use up a ton of counter space . 
what can you say about a apatula ?  it works . 
i received the case and have used it for quite a while . 
definitely don t put the sugar into the boiling area . 
simply use it with a mesh strainer with a handle . 
it whips through time consuming jobs and is dishwasher safe . 
i never noticed it discharging quicker than when i first bought it . 
in use the knife is wonderful ,  worth the money . 
i bought the dyson animal four years ago . 
the store wanted over $ for this product . 
system freezed up once when i input phone numbers with bluetooth device connected . 
i can put the stone in the oven with the rack . 
i have been considering buying a juicer for years . 
stuck it in the charger around num_extend pm . 
there has never been a failure with this product . 
we don t use a microwave to pop corn any more . 
 avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water . 
i also ordered one with marble rollers and like it very much too . 
next use will be for the christmas version of our turkey . 
it s as if i am holding one of wolverine s adamantium claws . 
it s bait ,  for pete s sake !  and it works . 
the scoop works well and just as expected . 
i am eating more salads now than ever . 
i plan on making every saturday morning waffle day in my home . 
yes ,  it takes time to brew coffee in this manner . 
with very little pressure ,  the knife sliced tomatoes tissue thin . 
these are a great replacement set for our broken beaters . 
it s small and compact and doesn t allow the device to fall . 
stacking these dishes so practical and saves space . 
i have also owned a plantronics voyager num_num and a motorola num_extend
oh ,  and don t forget an num_num month warranty . 
for $  or thereabouts  ,  this is worth it . 
water should flow from the faucet ,  which you can now turn off . 
you can even use used jar lids and reuse them again and again . 
i got this for my droid incredible cell phone . 
one of the best car chargers i ve ever bought . 
keeps them handy and out of the way . 
i can t say enough good things about the espressione pods . 
but the tale goes on :  the machine proved entirely resistant to cleaning . 
i debated on whether to get a num_num qt . 
i do regular ice for all my drinks even koolaid . 
it s a great product and a terrific value . 
why ?  because it worked so well for its intended purpose . 
haven t lost them yet but its only a matter of time . 
this has been the greatest battery ever for the evo . 
it is really lovely and just the right size for num_num mugs . 
i needed extras to leave in dry goods storage canisters . 
incidentally the used grounds are a benefit for gardens and lawns . 
i hope she found this one for her phone . 
it charges fast and the blue led light design looks neat . 
one of the girls on pretty little liars has this case . 
that s the only time i ve experienced hot water spitting . 
the sound quality is pretty good ,  above average . 
this plate cover is by far the best plate cover on the market . 
then appears well but not touch screen works . 
i snapped it back on ,  where it has since remained . 
the usb port also accepted devices with a smooth solid connection . 
this is the perfect accessory for power hungry droid . 
we just needed something cheap and small to grind our beans every morning . 
so much better than the small one that broke . 
it lives in my master bathroom closet and gets rolled out when needed . 
this works perfectly fine for the iphone num_extend
one of these came with my wolf convection microwave and i love it . 
very powerful ,  and ideal as a dedicated vacuum for my cars . 
this was a great value for the price and size . 
other chargers we have would just keep the power level steady . 
my son and his wife were very happy with the cast iron cookeare . 
the way they are built makes them easy to use as well . 
bought it for those large items :  tablecloths ,  draperies etc . 
and the other stays plugged into my desktop . 
i will update this if necessary ,  but i love this . 
the picture on amazon doesn t match the unit i received . 
it is really true that you can forget that you are wearing it . 
this bundle has great cases for men and many accessories . 
like it is stated it fits nokia num_extend very easily . 
here are a few pros and cons that i have come up num_extend
i like it and it made a cute accessory for my phone . 
you can see some condensation and water droplets on the inside . 
now start brewing and be prepared for a flavorful and fragrant indulgence . 
great to give as a gift along with some other tea products . 
you can hear the person calling you and they could hear her great . 
many serrated knives have one side that is flatter . 
makes quick work of carrots and whole apples . 
i helped set it up and gave it an inaugural run . 
just to confirm ,  it did work with my thunderbolt . 
i ordered num_num of these and only two worked . 
so my family is nuts about whirley pop . 
i am highly alergic to dust and pet dander . 
these are wonderful !  no more catching my hand in the headphone cord . 
all buttons work great and are easily accessible . 
bought it for my husband and he liked it . 
i used this waffle maker for the first time today . 
they are a addition to any tea time !  . 
beautiful vibrant color and quality construction and material . 
use a deep bowl instead of a wide bowl . 
i ll keep using it and not bother looking for a replacement . 
i purchased it ,  put it together and used it right away . 
took no time at ll and was simple . 
it finally lost suction a few days ago . 
best of all it s made in the u . s . 
i ve had my unit for about a year now . 
these scarf hangers are very useful for organizing ones closet . 
i also like that it can go into the dishwasher . 
they are easy to take off the ring to use them individually . 
these will be holiday gifts which i know will come in handy . 
they should have a better way to secure it to your ear . 
they have a great weight to them and look beautiful on the table . 
the num_extend mini is very easy on the eyes . 
it is much easier to use paper filters . 
i use it for a screen to hide my electric hot water heater . 
$ for this set of num_num is a great price . 
i use it to measure out ganache filling for cupcakes . 
be careful when ordering a just plain shiny tpu case . 
she really likes it and will be sending my sister one as well . 
it s not too heavy and will buy another one in the future . 
can slice or julienne vegetable to several different sizes . 
to my surprise the fishbone case is actually pretty nice . 
i wanted one that would read outside of the oven or toaster oven . 
the num_extend is all about the web and that it does exceptionally well . 
i will buy again to protect my phone . 
that said the num_extend smart pen is very nice ,  indeed . 
but for $ i thought it worth the risk . 
this is a perfect solution for my situation !  . 
worked great and we enjoyed perfectly cut fries . 
it arrived on time and is exactly how it is described . 
it takes longer than using a gas stove . 
the milk frothing attachment is a slightly odd siphon device . 
i am the only coffee drinker in my house . 
the board is well constructed and has a nice finish . 
it s almost as good as using my french press and much easier . 
they serve their purpose ,  and they look nice . 
from my reclining chair ,  i can command both fans . 
for the price ,  this is a decent waffle iron . 
it does a good job protection the phone from minor to medium drops . 
dipping the bread in oil is way too much . 
i got these for my husband for our anniversary . 
i knew going into this that it was not an authentic apple product . 
the jabra feels rather comfortable in the ear and it fit very well . 
i wanted another for my spouse but couldn t find one locally . 
it has gorilla screen which is scratch proof . 
i purchased this as a gift for a friend . 
instead of making a great big bundt cake you and give small ones . 
they arrived as promised and fit my machine perfectly . 
i oil mine about once a month with mineral oil . 
needed a battery for a phone that kept going down . 
resistant to getting sliced up by knives though no plastic boards last forever . 
that way the stand can stay in place easily with a carpeted floor . 
it kept my phone out of the sandy elements . 
it does hold an iphone num_extend with a case . 
one rub that i like is thetom douglas chicken rub . 
i think it s my personal problem rather than the pan s problem . 
i am accustomed to grabbing the handles of my pans when i cook . 
there always seems to be loose dust ,  etc . 
these are actually pretty good ,  despite the low price . 
from the standpoint of great tasting coffee this grinder is wonderful . 
love the way it feels when cutting into the pizza . 
it is so much easier to keep the s . s . 
i will use it until it doesn t charge anymore . 
it is perfectly effective ,  we never noticed issues with grounds coming through . 
we set up xbox and the computer to the tv . 
i would recommend this product in a heartbeat . 
i use it so much i never even unplug it . 
nice slider phone ,  wanted a change from the bricks and flip phones . 
i am pleased and would recommend this to anyone . 
they are a great value and make food preparation easier . 
she said that they would replace the lid . 
ups returned the batteries to the company for some unknown reason . 
of course ,  i did read about others getting clunkers . 
the batteries started to bulge after a year . 
i really couldn t be without this excellent pan . 
the next one has been working wonderfully all this time . 
fits great into the micro port on the phone charger . 
i don t mean to suggest these are fragile . 
it s been working great and the paint hasn t peeled . 
received quickly ,  fits perfect and the cuts out are perfect . 
these will come in handy when i need them . 
these hold a good edge and represent exceptional value . 
they work fine and they fit into standard spice jar openings . 
she is the second older lady who has told me the same thing . 
they make amazing phone designs and solid build . 
this product is highly effective in filtering the air in our bedroom num_extend
wanted a extra car charger for my iphone num_extend
i will be something that i will share . 
i was skeptical about the cone one ,  but it works really well . 
anyways ,  i just thought that it would tilt a little more . 
it doesn t last much longer than the factory one . 
also the touch screen is still just as responsive . 
i had the same situation ,  where one plate was crushed . 
i bought two of those as a backup for my iphone charger . 
i think that everyone is over reacting about the cover . 
i have owned about num_num different headsets over the past five years . 
i found the scanpan line and liked what i read . 
the skin get crispy enough that i found myself eating the skin !  . 
have had no problems at all with this unit . 
as always ,  the handle is quite ergonomic ,  an oxo trademark . 
the curved knife has sharp ,  heavy stainless blades . 
it may be bulky but you get use to it . 
these egg rings are just what i needed for fried eggs . 
this is black and decker using power drill technology on a chopper . 
these are very useful because of the soft heads . 
i haven t bought a loaf of bread since i bought this machine . 
i am not planning to drop the phone just to test it . 
otherwise ,  all electronics and other parts were still in functional condition . 
i use cutting mats over it when i m prepping . 
the samsung captivate  android phone  also has the same screen . 
one thing you ll love is the wide food chute . 
it would have saved me hours of frustration . 
these glasses are very pretty and too delicate for me . 
really ,  i needed a bit more information than  connect the wires here  . 
the evo has been off the charger for num_num hour now . 
it sits on a charger in my room . 
meaning num_num dishes in total but it s perfect for a small home . 
you will enjoy making ice cream with your kids and grand kids . 
i also appreciate the clean lines and easy installation . 
it fits over two burners and cooks well . 
we bought heavy duty hooks for the coats . 
i thought i would have to get rid of my bender . 
the srs wow built into the headphones makes music sound soooo much better . 
oh ,  and i don t get splatter with grease when cooking . 
lodge is an excellent manufacturer and really cares about their customers . 
my phone was running down quickly after only num_num minutes of use . 
i was impressed with the prompt and courteous customer service . 
it has worked great with everything i have tried . 
the pan works extremely well :  bakes and browns evenly . 
best $ i ve ever spent on my car . 
she said it s sturdy and deep fries perfectly . 
which is a huge bonus !  however ,  my music still has issues . 
i bought this to go over frozen pie shells when making quiches . 
i use frequently for my single cup rich coffee . 
easy to adjust the grind and the crank makes it easy to use . 
this case is everything i need in a case . 
this is the best coffee maker we ve ever owned . 
this was purchased as a present to replace a cracked iphone num_num case . 
these corner units are good for smaller plates ,  bowls ,  and saucers . 
these are more like cups for holding handmade chocolates . 
the micro sd to sd converter sleeves don t . 
the reason for num_num stars is because i think it is too thin . 
it is said that these filters will last a life time . 
it would be great for kids first phone as well . 
and this motorola unit hits all of those out of the park . 
it s perfect for protecting and caring for an expensive item . 
i loved it enough that i decided to buy this one . 
then it didn t work well at all anyway . 
product is exactly as pictured and arrived in record time . 
this is really well made and seems to made out of great materials . 
item arrived within time frame projected and was packed very good . 
fresh juice retains its flavor and crispness when stored in these . 
run it once in a while when i see one or two . 
read the reviews and was prepared for drips and leaks . 
i have larger hands which are also strong . 
now i use it for all my spices . 
this is our second purchase of thisvery model . 
i use it when out in the field . 
i like it clear so that i know how much soap is inside . 
you need one or more of these in your collection . 
the most i have gotten is about num_num hours . 
i can make thin or thick cuts with ease . 
the wep open works great and keeps the connection until you disconnect . 
phone doesnt slide out but rather just kinda pops in and out . 
the light does sometimes get annoying when night driving but its worth it . 
there have been improvements in num_num years ,  all of which we like . 
like how it is num_num pieces and you can use all together . 
it was no more stable but less reliable . 
this was the right price and has a classy look to it . 
easy ,  simple ,  and the electronic alarm is loud enough to hear . 
they are exactly the same just a different grip as you hold them . 
holds a lot of ice and still had cubes left the next morning . 
i get as much as possible out of the fruit this way . 
so much better than anything else i have ever used . 
they cook quickly too ,  clean up is rapid . 
my only complaint is that it is made in china . 
i took a chance with this and i m glad i did . 
i look forward to using it for many years to come . 
i will probably buy the cuisinart set after using this skillet . 
box fits nicely on phone and love the blue color . 
the other pan has a metal lid and has engraving on it . 
and it is a easy ,  hence i like it . 
but it is still easy to use without a lot of brute force . 
i considered this a complete success and made a few test calls . 
the cones come off soft and harden in maybe num_num seconds if that . 
i d probably give it num_extend stars if it were possible . 
i bought a set of these to make fruit rolls for hiking . 
it lasted id say a good num_num months . 
no caps ,  no locks ,  nothing to mess with . 
well made and durable; good quantity and price . 
all in about num_num seconds ! cleanup us so simple . 
she loves herbs and uses them all the time in making her tea . 
i love it and would recommend to anyone . 
i have not had any problems with either scoop . 
i love the color and quality of the dinnerware . 
breads ,  like rolls ,  do not come out so good . 
this set of glasses provides ten each of three different sizes . 
i am using this for my htc incredible . 
a traditional coffee maker takes up far too much room . 
it looks good ,  cleans good and cooks good . 
i usually feel that sometimes companies pump up the retail value . 
oven .  .  . they weren t capable of baking an edible loaf . 
the num_extend is a standalone battery that charges a multitude of devices . 
i am pleased that i was able to handle this prior to buying . 
this pan great for sauteing ,  omelets ,  and potatoes au gratin . 
we have had ours for num_num years and it is still going strong . 
regardless of whatever i am marinating with ,  the results are outstanding . 
however ,  my cookie sheets are large  about num_extend
talk time is great and standby time is awesome . 
the product looks great and is the perfect size . 
it quickly makes a single cup of coffee that is perfect . 
i keep one fully charged at all times . 
i use it for my htc sensation and the product delivers . 
this is a specialty case ,  not an everyday case for most people . 
i place hot dogs on a pie plateand let them cook . 
i ve never programmed it ,  nor even set the clock . 
so ,  the charger also works for my phone . 
get a case opener tool if that is a problem . 
keep the burner temp lower than usual and you will have perfect pancakes . 
i will keep purchasing these till i do though . 
it is basically a dust buster on a stick . 
it is as advertised and as good commented by others . 
great to use outside by the pool in the summer . 
during long listening sessions however ,  my ears did get a little achy . 
when i found it again i literally screamed in joy !  . 
apple provides a bare minimum of cabling with the iphone . 
also am not sure if it s bpa free or not . 
i feel like i m learning how to cook all over again . 
no complaints and don t anticipate needing to replace it for many years . 
nice ,  lightweight and very reasonable unit ,  i would buy this again . 
i bought it originally because of the review in cooking illustrated . 
i bought this for my sister and she loves it . 
we usually just hand wash it ,  but it s dishwasher safe . 
it s also beautiful looking and made in the usa . 
this didn t bother me much so maybe my neck is bigger . 
the plug fits into my car nice and tight . 
i don t think this is an every day case . 
i have used this fry pan for many mnonths . 
i use this more often than i bag foods . 
i ve used it many times and so far no issues . 
i read the other reviews and picked this pizzelle baker . 
on the other hand ,  it makes it really easy to take off . 
otherwise ,  still going strong three or four times a week . 
i originally bought these to round out a $ supersaver shipping offer . 
be sure to rinse your rice num_extend cooking . 
the larger bowl simply provides another serving dish for family get togethers . 
fold it over ,  and put it through again . 
i like to run it in the winter months . 
so its really not an optimal car device . 
it is very light weight and i love that . 
the day it dies i will be ordering another immediately . 
i was up and running with my printer in a couple of minutes . 
pairing takes a good num_num to num_num seconds . 
i don t think one can go wrong with this pot . 
that being said ,  i would buy this again . 
simple to clean ,  i usually hand wash num_extend
it is just the right size for a single person . 
i m happy to say that it presents no problems in my case . 
it just burns the toast unless i manually pop it up . 
i recommend this cable ,  it works perfectly and has very little difference . 
i am sure i will experiment alot with different things . 
henceforth i keep the data cable with my computer . 
we store all kinds of cooked dishes and yogurt in it . 
but i have none of the problems as the others mentioned . 
especially since i do so much baking and cooking . 
i just wish the filters were more inexpensive  :   . 
it has a soft leather case with sturdy stitching . 
on those ,  it does a truly superb job . 
i prefer to remove than to clean the skins out of the press . 
bigger than the other stylus that ordered but it s a good thing . 
i still have my corelle from num_num years ago  wedding gift  . 
it s the perfect size and is well made . 
i also bought the mini roses pan to have alongside the large cake . 
when we could afford it ,  we got one ,  too . 
i use just basic white sandwich bread and they fit fine . 
i ve had this for over num_num months now . 
these stands are sturdy ,  and exceptionally reasonably priced . 
i wish i had purchased the smaller one though . 
an oem usm charger for a fraction of what sprint wanted for one . 
i gave them to my bf as a gift . 
had the defender case and tossed that for this !  good lucj . 
i love that i can wash and reuse them . 
my soda siphon is still going strong ,  one year later . 
i haven t tested it beyond that amount of time . 
my thought was to leave the salt out of the receipe . 
very happy with the quality and the size of the stand . 
it is well made and easy to clean . 
the screen is still in place with no problems at all . 
i was thrilled to no end !  it was all so easy . 
and the lid doesn t fall off when he pours a cup . 
this spatula has been frequently used for years and is going strong . 
it drains water effectively while keeping spaghetti inside . 
today i am downgrading it to one star . 
this one even rings when you get a call . 
i use this for making small batches of baked goods . 
the num_extend has better designed buttons that both feel and work better . 
i highly recommend this to anyone that cooks with cast iron . 
i had been looking for this case and finially found it . 
nice coverage ,  bright colors and fun pattern ,  light feel . 
ok ,  i resisted getting a cookie scoop for a long time . 
you can charge either the battery ,  the phone or both . 
my only complaint is the small opening in the carafe for cleaning . 
thank you so much , look forward for your other stuff . 
it is a good size and is very easy to use . 
previously ,  i had been using a num_num cup drip coffee maker . 
the extra power is well worth the extra $
it was confusing to me if the lid sealed or not . 
they can also be vacuumed several times before they become ineffective  to thin  . 
get tea lights with casings because these don t have any . 
scoop into a coverable container and place in freezer . 
unfortunately ,  its a bit large for the num_num to num_num oz . 
since i have been using this ,  i never have to worry . 
my husband bought this for me for christmas . 
only one airbubble due to some dust that slipped in there . 
i was disappointed with this product at first . 
the wood splitting issue is real ,  but avoidable with patience and care . 
it s always good to have extra cables for your phone . 
these feel great ,  and have lasted a long time . 
i also seasoned mine a bit before first use . 
even then reception on verizon in my area was not great . 
music synchronization with desktop is not as nice as iphone . 
but num_num pounds of potatoes have made me a believer . 
the fit was perfect ,  both to the cuisnart base and the lid . 
we bought this for our dog to make chicken jerky . 
the cornbread is browned just right and comes right out of the pan . 
had good business with them ,  good luck all the way . 
i just made two batches of waffles on my chef s choice num_extend
i like them smaller so i ordered the smaller size one afterward . 
much easier to collect and transfer zest into desired plates or bunch together . 
it really is worth it s weight in gold . 
everything i packed and froze is safe and free from leaking . 
i own the mixer and it sees use around the holidays . 
it is a good look for my phone . 
this is a great place to get stuff for my phone . 
i haven t used the gun that comes with it though . 
a and it is very inexpensive !  i really like it . 
assembly was easy ,  and it s also easy to run and clean . 
this is one item on her wish list . 
depending on the food item ,  some are harder to mill than others . 
charges my phone well ,  that s all i ask of it !  . 
it is still great as far as i know . 
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
it cooked my black rice hard to cook kind  just perfect . 
i wish i had purchased a second one for myself . 
it does the job for what i got it for . 
i bought two and one started leaking from the bottom after a year . 
i know my phone is safe in this cover !  . 
i have purchased speaker stands and mounts each time i moved . 
the grind on the steel seems just right . 
overall it is super !  great big fluffy kernels of corn . 
these things really started to concern me and i needed a solution . 
yes ,  make sure you purchase the correct size for your needs . 
the copper core line was not yet available . 
now as i mentioned i used it outside camping . 
i have dropped my phone a few times and no damage was done . 
this should also reduce the power consumption a bit . 
because the design and tech haven t changed since the num_extend
amazon had a great price and shipped fast . 
great cookware !  bought for my daughter for christmas . 
still ,  it has the correct appearance to fit droid num_num global . 
so easy to use to zest all kinds of things . 
i was sent a replacement cover and recieved it in two business days . 
i cannot think of one single negative thing to say about the brewstation . 
plus i like the nifty blue logo when it s plugged in . 
i use them to store dried foods longer . 
i continue to use this for for grilling as well . 
they are great !  keeps coffee hot ,  and no spills . 
i ve used this frying pan and it functions well . 
my wife and i are very happy with it so far . 
the same as i use on the spark plugs in my car . 
this knife cuts my bread without squishing it and is dishwasher safe . 
they both make great iced tea especially loose teas . 
attach the paddle attachment ,  then place a dime in the bowl . 
it has a nice heavy quality to it . 
by the second set i discovered the perfect amount . 
definitely recommended for those of you who like to make homemade pasta !  . 
it s good quality and after hundreds of uses it looks brand new . 
this is the only you want and need . 
i monunted my speakers to the stand with screws for better stablility . 
the case has a labeled space for each screwdriver . 
podcasts can be downloaded over the air with google listen . 
very great for bottling a lot of things at a time . 
i will definitely buy these again for my future phones . 
i bounght mine six years ago in num_extend
also ,  the old ones had suffered attrition from chipping and breaking . 
my husband and i like things that last . 
works well for the job it is intended to do . 
i purchased this skillet and absolutely love it . 
it is finally nice to have a backup battery for samsung galaxy sii . 
oxo is always a good brand ,  so i went with oxo . 
i ve been using this for about three years now . 
badly frozen food and spoiled cheese for years and years . 
best part so easy to clean with just a wipe . 
i use this more than i thought i would especially on cupcakes . 
the individual results were :  num_extend num_extend and num_extend
this is the perfect whisk for small jobs . 
some of the traditional cloth versions are too bulky . 
i found that there was a clog in the feed line . 
this is another excellent baking pan from calphalon . 
the wilton standard is high as usual ,  no complaints at all . 
no complaints ,  it works perfectly with my blackberry bold num_extend
it is also excellent for cutting through tomato skins . 
i was so eager to make my first loaf but resisted . 
does a good job and easy to read . 
but silicon work great for not scratching surfaces . 
they have survived many trips through the dishwasher and the markings remain unaffected . 
it is built so strongly i think it will last a long time . 
any suggestions ?  if so ,  please add a comment to this review . 
this is everything i wanted it to be . 
price was lower than any retailer that i saw this at . 
i was shocked at the quality of this product . 
my first thought was that it must be a scam . 
and having them chopped under the bowl keeps the tears away . 
it came with its original box and accessories . 
i ve recommended this armband several time to other runners . 
so i decided to spend a little more this time . 
heavy duty nylon with a nice velcro securing system . 
one is black ,  the other  flat earth  color . 
we ve used it probably close to twenty times now with no problems . 
this is a very effective steamer for the home . 
it sits very nicely on the counter ,  near the cuisinart . 
i steamed the drapes on two windows in no time . 
but love love love love love love love love it !  !  !  . 
it finished cooking quickly ,  and the gravy and veggies turned out perfect . 
these glass jars are perfect for a lot of different uses . 
this one is so nice and cool looking and she agrees !  . 
i have been using this one for several years . 
i bought these at a very nice price . 
i would probably have ordered the num_num gal size if i had . 
i have in a rather big bathroom and it cools it off well . 
i will review each of its attributes num_extend
i needed something to replace my old num_num cup cuisinart thermal . 
dough for loaves of sourdough or flavored breads . 
i absolutely love the tools and the works very well . 
the dish and cover are a nice size without being too big . 
for my husband who bawls like a baby when he slices onions . 
oxo never disappoints with their products and this is no exception . 
worth the money for sure !  very good grinder !  . 
another clue it worked well ,  they quit making them !  . 
 gsm and cdma maps are not as great as they show them  . 
it makes serving from the pan much easier . flat bottom vs round . 
can definitely reuse again without worrying about it falling apart . 
vocalyst allows you to listen to any emails or text messages . 
we purchased this product approximately one year ago and use it regularly . 
so while it won t fit in my pocket ,  it is recommended . 
this is possibly the battery pack to end all battery packs . 
i am on num_extend mobile network data ,  gps enabled . 
this egg cooker is the best i have ever used . 
bubbles were easy to remove when first putting on the cover . 
i always ended up with mangled pieces of meat and swashed bread . 
the spring action is too loose for my preference . 
you will even add your own style and variations to it . 
then i bought a $ kit of three adhesive screen protectors . 
my wok is now shiny black and nothing stick . 
these chargers worked in both devices as chargers and transfer cables . 
and i got grounds in my cup too . 
the dual usb output is also a great feature . 
this replaced another nokia  that i no longer remember the model number to  . 
disgusting !  !  anyway ,  the vacuum cleaned it up nicely . 
i lucked out and got it at walmart for $
this review is of the nite ize universal sport case tone wide  black  . 
if you love popcorn ,  i recommend this popper . 
that beings said ,  it will protect it to some extent . 
the copper bottom will visibly rainbow as all copper products do . 
probably one of the best purchases i ever made . 
would recommend these to any one that likes to cook . 
i would make sure and buy extra replacement ear hooks though . 
but this potato ricer is really a must have in my kitchen now . 
the pictures and video it takes are amazing . 
this item does not come with screws or anchors for the wall . 
only need to be  very  careful when you apply these . 
i was having trouble sleeping and then waking up with headaches . 
until then ,  i thought the unit was defective . 
next ,  i hooked up my ipod using the standard apple charge cord . 
you do need to clean it up after use . 
after all these years ,  it s never been a bother . 
love it !  very simple to us and easy to clean . 
this is fun with the kid but a bit messy . 
if you need a flexible turner ,  this is not it . 
it is so powerful ,  yet so light and takes up little space . 
i feel like my phone is pretty safe while in this case . 
my son and i both find the carbonated water more thirst quenching . 
i use this mixer to mix thick cookie dough . 
i quickly removed it and tried the other two brands . 
this holds enough that i can strain num_num qts . 
i can t imagine having to press garlic for hours with this thing . 
i love how it has the cut out for the apple symbol too . 
at this price ,  i can have them all over the house . 
the careful engineering and attractive ,  simple design of both products impress me . 
i buy extra batteries and an outside charge . 
i was concerned that the white would get dirty easily . 
it is flat and stayed that way after numerous trips through the dishwasher . 
i m so happy to finally have some good knives . 
i paid very little for it back in num_extend
wow !  this great !  i have more than num_extend and num_num videos . 
i would recommend it to others . so yea anyway . 
results will be the same as num_num star restaurant prepares . 
num_extend in my experience generally puts out very high quality consumer products . 
i don t mind  pulling it out  to use it . 
maybe they updated their screen protector when i purchase march num_num who know . 
there is absolutely no issue with the volume . 
i ordered the silver one and love it . 
i have had success with the full size sim card . 
i ve had this for a while now ,  and it s great . 
i decided to remove mine today to test that aspect . 
the hanger broke the first time i used it . 
i ve made italian bread that i d put against any bakery loaf . 
i only wish i had a cook book to go along with this . 
this allows the phone to charge and turns it into an alarm clock . 
the rubbery ring on the lid comes off easily for cleaning . 
i have another good grips turner that i like better . 
i work remotely and use the jabra stone num_num all the time . 
great invention ,  but it is a bit bulky . 
i d definitely buy another ,  should mine ever break . 
especially for my sons phone because children today text like crazy . 
works great for my iphone and the price was good as well . 
num_num days and free shipping was a great plus . 
i get two ,  three bars in a num_extend bar area . 
this is the second plantronics num_num that i have purchased from amazon . 
it holds more knives than my old on the counter knife block . 
apparently ,  it is ,  and to get great results too . 
it may have been there but it seemed more noticeable on this one . 
to avoid scratching when scooping contents we use plastic measuring cups and spoons . 
before ,  i could never really get into those crevices . 
there are ten speeds with a slide lever on the mixer head . 
i have already dropped the phone on concrete . 
they respond to email inquiries immediately and politely . 
a softer crust slices easily with one pass . 
i wish it didnt have a small hole in it though . 
the only problem i had with this rack is assembly . 
most important ,  does what it is supposed to . 
i love not worrying about getting tiny chia seeds stuck in my teeth . 
it was easy to install ,  and the instructions were understandable . 
the replacement back that comes with it fits well . 
you will get mild to heavy mineral buildup depending on your water supply . 
neither phone has come to any harm in nine months of use . 
it works great with my iphone num_extend it is somewhat cheaply made . 
the handle is comfortable and the edge sharp for cutting . 
i think i will buy another set soon . 
however ,   made in the usa  makes the cost easier to swallow . 
the replacement back keeps the profile smooth and not bulky . 
not a big deal since they still do the job . 
i received a kitchen aid artisan stand mixer ,  in empire red . 
hard to snap together an will come apart if it hits the ground . 
my favorite part of the update was the new gallery . 
i have had a krups moka brew coffee maker for over num_num year . 
it just works and works well  iphone num_extend
the kitchen utensils came well packed in a tube container . 
was about ready to send my jawbone era back . 
i m just learning how to make pasta from scratch . 
if you want your phone to lookd pretty ,  this is the case . 
thanks again to oxo for another great gadget !  . 
the only downside is they are flavored the same . 
i process a lot ,  so num_num units are better for me . 
i ll get back to let bm customers know . 
the iphone is nothing compared to the samsung infuse . 
i would spread the word to all my friends to buy one . 
they took all of num_num minutes to hang . 
i use this solution in a lasko num_num gal humidifer . 
the outer diameter is around num_extend but the cooking surface is about num_extend
this is a stylish handset and easy to use . 
i have used these for years and they have been great . 
this beats trying to scoop out fat with a spoon any day . 
it charges quickly ,  but it burns just as quick . 
you can buy replacement paddles and pans ,  but that s all . 
my husband recently finished school ,  and entered the professional workplace . 
i keep one side cooler than the other . 
i recommend it for iphone num_num or num_extend
so i took a shot and ordered this . 
the hinges as also others mentioned are absolutely horribly designed . 
my wife has a mini muffin pan and these are perfect for it . 
i also recommend getting the cone holder which simplified the process . 
the handle is weighted almost perfectly and shaped as well . 
wakes up each morning and starts  creating on the art desk . 
the gold filter allows more oil and particulates into the coffee . 
fits well in my hand ,  and is easy to clean . 
have not used it for cooking ,  only pressure canning . 
they are easy to clean ,  serve their function and look great . 
i bought this slicer second hand for $
i got this strainer to use to strain fats . 
not a professional grade mandolin by any stretch but it does the job . 
best of all ,  it looks at home in a contemporary kitchen . 
all the devices i ve put on it have been num_extend
i have no worries of my phone being scratched at all . 
it is quiet compared to the old one and chops quickly . 
it takes a while and may run out of charge before completion . 
shipping was quick and it arrived in good shape . 
if you can cook ,  you will still appreciate it . 
the only real negative working against my old mr . 
this amazon site makes it look minty but disregard that . 
i actually want to steal his case all the time . 
we no longer wash our ice cream scoops with soap . 
thought i would give it quick test on the kitchen floor . 
still the best gym investment i have made . 
this stores easily due to the removable pan . 
it is easy to use ,  bright and nice . 
these are great phone chargers for the iphone num_extend
it is very simple to get set up and to use . 
this is something to look for when this kind of product is used . 
i didn t bake any cakes or cookies so i don t know . 
water collects under the lip and it has to be towel dried . 
i grind it before putting it into the pot . 
off to the store i went to return the new one . 
really works bring the fiz back to the soda . 
so ,  for a couple bucks ,  this thing is great . 
they re made of metal though !  that surprised me  :  . 
this one is definitely better than that one ,  and works great !  . 
much better than holding it in your lap or laying it flat . 
my sister asked for black measuring spoons and cups for christmas . 
still you cannot have enough of these chargers . 
so i had to use my own tools to magnetize the provided screwdriver . 
this is a great vacuum at any price . 
if they were ,  not she would tell me . 
five stars if you need a slim iphone num_num case . 
grill marks belong on meat and not sandwiches . 
i love this toaster !  it has so many features . 
but now some  if not all  anchor hocking glass is made in china . 
these pans are heavy and the handles get hot . 
easy to assemble ,  and saves a great deal of space . 
there is a sound indicator when the battery gets low . 
reasonably priced and served its purpose well . the colors were as described . 
none of them seem to work for me . 
a great alternative to buying overpriced cables from apple . 
i also use it to place frozen items on while defrosting . 
great little thing to have !  it doesn t weigh much . 
i make bread and needed loaf bags to keep the loaf fresh . 
they clean up pretty easily ,  and i am happy with the purchase . 
thats unheard of for a case this cheap !  . 
downloads contacts  not normal  streams music to system etc . 
it is larger ,  more solid ,  and much easier to operate . 
it is so solid and heavy ,  i barely have to apply pressure . 
when i purchased these ,  i didn t realize they were actually mirrored . 
i can do my whole house on one charge . 
this case is as advertised and then some . 
i bought this electric tea maker and use it almost every day . 
just the best case on the market in every way . 
i used the lid to hold my salad fixins  the next day . 
it is a good quality i woul recomende it . 
a few more quiet private minutes before the day claims you !  . 
you plug it in as directed on the instructions . 
the new mophie i purchased is num_num months old and still going strong . 
packaging seemed to work perfectly !  great buy and love this set !  . 
i use my vege scrub to clean the grate ,  which works well . 
it has a classic ,  sophisticated look with excellent fit and functionality . 
these are fantastic ,  i actually learned about lodge cast iron in mexico . 
it disperses heat evenly and maintains it well . 
didn t know i needed it until i have one . 
my wife loves it and gets lots of compliments . 
this filter fits perfectly and works like it is supposed to . 
and my wife thinks it toasts bread and muffins better than any toaster . 
i love these and used them all the time . 
i actually like this charger and it charges my phone faster . 
suction cups stay put on my stainless sink . 
using this handset it s just like being on a phone call . 
they re listening so intently that they ve not said more  :   . 
i use it for myself when i want a drink of water . 
we have used the four star series for many years . 
ordered and received this and it s so superior to the old one . 
the nonstick pot is a huge improvement over my old panasonic . 
they hold up stuff on my fridge ,  just what i needed . 
item came as described ,  all the necessary parts came in the box . 
i have used it for a measuring cup and also for a pitcher . 
of course the bottle it self seems fairly tough . 
the previous one opened many hundreds of bottles of wine effortlessly . 
we get alot of use out of it . 
cooking two poached eggs to perfection is very easy . 
once i began looking ,  the options were endless . 
we love our homemade pizza and would have it no other way . 
i chose my battery according to what my use will be . 
this is the best kind of bottle opener on the market . 
the dialer is much improved and easier to use as well . 
i make sureit is covered in the drawer . 
other than being too thin for my taste ,  they seemed very nice . 
for most uses ,  it s too sturdy ,  to my mind . 
this is our second time purchasing this product . 
and it s excellent for all sorts of things . 
we love our coffee and love our coffee center . 
i ordered them for my husband and he loves them . 
about the same form factor as the ipad charging brick . 
this a real food processor ,  not one of the featherweight cheapo models . 
this one seems to work very very well for the price . 
the two messages i found most useful were battery status and caller id . 
i am very happy that this product worked . 
it is so much tidier and easier to manage . 
you can also grill veggies along with the meat . 
so i need only a single charging system . 
it charges the device just as it should . 
the mixing sound is not an annoying one . 
the instructions were easy to follow and user friendly . 
the rubberized coating is smooth to the touch and unobtrusive . 
went on line and they responded i can still return it . 
what happened ,  the reviews are always dead on . 
i recommend this product as well as this seller . 
i would rate this a num_num if i could . 
it s very spacious and heats up real quick . 
the color pops out adding joy and whimsy to my kitchen . 
and still will buy more ,  and give them as christmas gifts . 
this is the easiest way to strain yogurt in the fridge . 
the cost savings of bulk soap is tremendous . 
this thing blows away my num_num dollar drip machine . 
i do use it for every meat i roast anymore ,  though . 
the price of these filters works out to be about $ each . 
it will grind very fine and i would buy this product again . 
i like this product ,  but it sometimes leaks . 
you ll need waterproof headphone for this to really work . 
we wanted to be happy and get a machine we would use . 
the bottom threaded mount is a real bonus . 
it only does so for the last few minutes of the process . 
i ve used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones . 
individual cables are not labeled as to what device they are num_extend
on the lowest speed it sounds like there is water boiling . 
the phone feels very solid and firm in my hand . 
my husband is a huge fan of this popper . 
that said ,  these knives are very sharp and are used a lot . 
the replacement came faster than the original order and works fine . 
nevertheless ,  it sure beats trying to grill toasts on a round pan . 
if you drop your phone a lot get these they are great . 
i think i m very happy with this machine so far . 
as it turns out ,  not every measuring cup is created equal . 
waited close to num_num weeks to receive this . 
other than that ,  it s basically like all other gsm phones . 
however ,  you will pay more than twice as much  for just num_extend
it bends to fit the bottom of any pan . 
i really enjoyed my oysters better with this knife . 
would i have paid num_num for this ?  probably not . 
i work for sprint and demo a lot of phones . 
it doesn t take long to heat up and maintains well . 
perfect size for scotch cakes and english muffins . 
i bought this on a whim seven years ago next month . 
wouldn t trade this thing in for a bag for anything . 
however ,  there are instructions for that as well in the book . 
i love the basket which is easy on and off . 
 :   easy to clean and seems very durable . 
it does a great job and so far the rubber has stayed pliable . 
for this kind of use the battery lasts about num_extend on one charge . 
i have used it almost daily since it arrived . 
well made and i hope those chinese workers were paid well . 
i am really new to dutch oven cooking . 
awesome for people that dont like touchscreens phones . 
they work wonders by allowing you to use bigger borders on larger cakes . 
you gain confidence with it the more you use it . 
as an allergy sufferer ,  i particularly detest vacuuming . 
i would have known this if i fully read the description . 
you just have to let the curved part  relax  so it will open . 
it is a great and fast meal with a lot less trouble . 
definitely does a great job to protect the phone . 
this thing does it s job !  it cuts a mean pizza . 
i tried this last night ,  and it is pretty good . 
it s really easy to put on the phone s screen . 
works num_num % of the time . easy to put together . 
it cost like $ but so worth it because it works so well . 
i have only used it once to beat an egg . 
i usually season them a few times before i use them . 
i like the shape of the spoon itself ,  being somewhat elongated . 
i love this bumper case for my iphone num_extend
i already own an atlantis pitcher and love it . 
i never forget my phone or my license this way . 
this is a great knife for the price . 
added it as another line to my tmobile account . 
fit perfectly on the iphone num_extend and it works great . 
not a sudden bulge ,  but a gentle slope . 
it has to have time to do the work . 
i actually use this to serve sheet cake most of the time . 
i prefer emptying it out into a wooden bowl . 
our daughter had this model so we got one for us . 
this item is clearly the best microwave unit on the market i believe . 
it has worked just fine now for going on two years . 
the pocket on the outside fits the flat beater well . 
i will purchase again and again from reallook . 
these come clean without using a net shower pouf . 
i ve said for years i wanted a set like it . 
frankly ,  this gift keeps on giving for years . 
i m very happy with my purchase of this machine . 
makes my phone even more attractive than without it . 
they didn t grind up at all ,  which surprised me . 
good gift for someone with a new smartphone . 
i love that they are one solid piece . 
very handy since the galaxy num_extend drains them pretty quickly . 
not much to add to the other reviews . 
and they took up tons of space stacked . 
all in all it is a good product and i would recommend it . 
this grinder replaced a braun grinder that i ve had forever . 
i thought it was a dud at first . 
best $ i have ever spent for home organization type stuff . 
still waiting to get the filter for this pot . 
they have different sizes and i m probably getting a second for water . 
i bought a new cookbook that called to use a food processor . 
i wanted a healthier snack and this popper is a great help . 
the only down fall is samsung will not update to num_extend
one for cat food and one for cooking . 
i used the otterbox defender for my iphone num_extend and loved it . 
my phone found the device and synced up with no problems . 
great product will order more when i need more . 
i still love my all clad fry pans and saute pans ,  though . 
the frozen tundra of the north in an old victorian home . 
i looked at purchasing a squeezer for oranges ,  lemons and limes individually . 
i love these things and keep buying them . 
she needed it for a t mobile phone i gave her . 
i know the dimensions are given ,  but it was still surprising . 
my relationship with sprint got off on a bumpy start . 
the combination of the popper and oil worksgreat for us . 
just be prepared to never buy another bag of microwave popcorn again . 
i use for both my ipod and iphone . 
i recommend using num_num hands when moving the big num_extend pan . 
will be looking at them in the future for new items . 
great for cutting rose stems and thorns and small branches . 
the first time i made up a dough from a bad recipe . 
keep the dough moist with a damp towel over the bowl . 
to turn it off ,  click on the  speaker  icon again . 
very pleased with the build quality of the battery . 
those stresses cause cracks and joint failure over time . 
the digital display has numbers that correspond to temperature settings  i . e . 
never again !  i will buy another the second this one stops working . 
ear buds fit into my ears without a hitch . 
it s completely worthless and just makes the bowl harder to clean . 
this works the same as the oem battery in my x . 
has an adjustable wand that s perfect for tall  or short  users . 
i ve always wondered why these were not found in stores . 
some soy milk it might not work with . 
clean up is easy . i think scanpan s are first rate . 
i use them often in my baking and cooking . 
it only has high ,  low ,  or off settings . 
unfortunately ,  that bass isn t as deep as it is boomy . 
we used num_extend of oil in a frying pan . 
i am not sorry that i bought this . 
the thing in the middle on mine is crooked . 
at least it gets the lid off about % of the time . 
it is my first choice for the day to day usage . 
buy it; you will not regret the decision . 
once you get it on your wall ,  you will love it . 
i ve had it a week now and have had great results . 
it would look pretty over a blue ,  green or yellow table cloth . 
no problems charging it up and it holds a good charge . 
i could not believe how great the phone was . 
it just did some miracle on num_num years old carpet . 
i have a small kitchen and little storage space to begin with . 
i love the compact design and fit of the ear rest . 
i am very pleased and will order the next size down as well . 
when given the choice ,  i always buy oxo . 
these rings are thin aluminum ,  so they are a bit cheap . 
this is a great blender that s gotten a bad rap . 
this product looks good and stands up to normal wear and tear . 
so far she enjoys the case and it is protecting her phone . 
it also filters the water more quickly than others i ve owned . 
we bought this for king crab legs and the price . 
i use the peeler for apples ,  for the most part . 
the scale is very accurate ,  and provides the same result each time . 
useful little item for neatly slicing avocados for your salads . 
great alternative versus buying one in store for over $
i use it before using my knifes and after i wash them . 
i ve used this coffee grinder for about a year with no problem . 
had to also buy num_num pin adapter in instructions . 
i got this about ten years ago and it still working fine . 
put them in and then put the appropriate tip on the end . 
my only gripe about the screen is that it is extremely sensitive . 
i ve been having a pair of these for years . 
the clog was very small but had a huge impact on the suction . 
has a very solid feel and the screen protector is top notch . 
anyway ,  i think it still much better than the commercial alternative . 
the holes are in the right places ,  to include the microphone holes . 
so why not buy num_num for cheaper $
the one from the sprint store was more money ,  but thicker . 
though difficult to push ,  this cleaner made my carpet look new . 
it recharges pretty fast too with the wall charger that comes with it . 
when it arrived ,  i noticed the packaging was repackaged using smaller staples . 
i read tons of reviews before finally buying this knife . 
sometimes they can get discolored or food can get stuck on them . 
what a nice buy ! i love this shelving unit . k . 
i owned one for more than num_num years . 
well worth it and is really what its worth . 
we travel with our apple products and use them at home . 
one of the best things we ve purchased in a very long while . 
these boards are simple and inexpensive ,  and do their job well . 
the heavy duty polished chrome roller shower curtain rings are great . 
many reviewers have complained about their units breaking down . 
it tells you what channel to tune to . 
i ll order this again when i need it . 
i bought one as a gift and one for me . 
it feels well built ,  runs quiet ,  and performs okay . 
and it adjusts so it fits almost any sink . 
i got this for my iphone num_extend and it works . 
i was astounded looking at what this machine cleaned out of my carpets . 
perfect fit ,  and stylish !  i like the looks of them . 
the  goblets  are what you might think of as being regular wine glasses . 
i would have had to buy an entire new blender . 
however ,  was pleasantly surprised when i received it . 
the second time i screwed up the camera . 
too bad you have to buy by piece rather than complete set . 
compared to the apple version thise product is great . 
this phone could be dropped anywhere and still be fine . 
this second button is also the volume control . 
it has so many features to use and i love it . 
does not have cool handles despite some media attestations to such . 
many cases out there and a lot of junk . 
there are convenient cup markings on the inside of the pot . 
uninteresting cafeteria lunches has confirmed how much i prefer bento lunches . 
i loved my one pan so much i bought a second one . 
the classic red bird whistle works just as you would expect it to . 
yummy !  it is very easy to assemble and it heated up quickly . 
the smaller sizes are sturdy enough and have been easy to keep clean . 
i just slipped it back on and have not had an issue since . 
i even sat on it and had zero interference . 
i wish they could have put oil on it instead . 
the measurements are engraved into the metal so they won t wear off . 
this portable charger really is the size of a lipstick . 
i cook a lot and found this press to fit all my needs . 
this can opener is really easy to use . 
matches the satin nickel on my moen curved shower rod perfectly . 
this is a nice product and a good price . 
arrived in good shape and was easy to set up and use . 
the container is basic and simple to clean . 
they are meant as a guide for the max . 
leave a comment or mark the review as useful if you think so . 
i would assume it will do the same for a bottle of wine . 
it beats digging around a drawer for a long spoon any day . 
my mom had given me a very popular juicer that she never used . 
would love to get a set of num_num steak knives from this company . 
but this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing . 
this does exactly what it was designed to do . 
she loves purple and the look of this case fit the bill . 
these didn t work on my jars the first few tries . 
well worth the price  even without the free shipping availability  . 
just a little too big for my taste . 
it is a piece of cake for both tasks . 
less expensive plugs tend to break at that point . 
love this charger ,  fast charge ,  and also white . 
much easier to deal with than traditional two piece jar lids . 
that s a sign of a really good grater . 
that s when i came across this larger cup cuisinart . 
i replaced a num_num year old round pizza stone with this one . 
this is probably due to me installing the invisishield wrong . 
the spout is big enough to pour faster than my cheap model . 
it worked very poorly ,  and broke on the second use . 
but for now ,  it s everything i hoped it would be . 
also she states the mug is handy and durable . 
i expect this unit will hold up for many years . 
compared to the windtunnels i have ,  my dyson is superquiet . 
i like my coffee hot and strong :  can do . 
i baked a batch of cookies the other day . 
i got my first nordic ware in num_num as a wedding gift . 
the knives are excellent ,  as is usual for shun knives . 
its where i get all my iphone and ipod accessories . 
i m on the phone over num_extend minutes every month . 
so ,  i bought one and i love it also . 
i wanted more screens for drying herbs so they would quit falling through . 
the blade is sharp and has a nice spring along the length . 
and i like it almost as much as my jawbone . 
it takes literally seconds to boil in the pot . 
i use it for mixing my pancake batter every morning . 
works just as well if not better than the one supplied by samsung . 
it looks nice on the counter and does its job . 
i use mine with normal cone filters which work fine . 
this is like baking your artisan bread in a clay oven . 
i am not sure about filter life or dependability yet . 
this is a near perfect pan for baking shortbread . 
why did it take me so long to make this simple switch ?  . 
i can finally get close to uniform slices . 
it doesn t seem a tight lid but no spills so far . 
the plastic cap seals pretty tightly for freshness . 
that being said ,  i do have issues with them . 
and it turns out incredible oatmeal !  among many other dishes . 
if you want hot coffee for hours ,  not minutes ,  buy this . 
however ,  i usually just go back and finish off the container . 
toss in your salted popcorn and shake away . 
they use a crude bimetal thermostat on my unit . 
try to look for one at your local department store . 
this is the best screen protector i ve ever had . 
cleaning and charge is not that messy like what some people said . 
oxo just makes great products ,  especially for this arthritically challenged cook . 
i highly recommend it to anyone needing a mixing bowl that stays put . 
they felt better and lighter in my ear . finally i tried the num_extend
i just love ,  love ,  love all my cast iron pots . 
immediately unboxed the items using the unpacking directions on the box . 
one handed just flying through rolling out doughs and pastries and donuts . 
i was intrigued by the design so decided to buy it . 
easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  dishwasher safe  except the base  . 
great price for a nice little non stick toaster oven pan . 
each of these tumblers weighs in at num_num grams num_extend ounces  . 
this is the best idea yet for cell phones . 
can t plug into a dock without removing the cover completely . 
and it shuts it self off which is a good feature . 
i did a beautiful risotto the other day . 
it did the job it wa supposed to do . 
i just love this little tea bag holder . 
we have two ,  one for each end of the table . 
the products inside the box were just as described . 
unfortunately after a while they heart my ears . 
the power hand nozzle is great on furniture . 
the rolled handle is comfortable to use ,  the edge cuts easily . 
i bought this for my daughter in law for christmas . 
but it is still a num_num star even considering those two little things . 
the razor is the one and only phone my husband will use . 
it almost looks like white satin or silk in some areas . 
this does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
the pizza baked on this stone comes out tasty and crispy . 
worth the price and it is amazing !  this case is so pretty . 
it is a great shade of purple and goes well with his phone . 
i only wish i could use it for scissors ,  too !  . 
good price for a quality brand ,  should last many years . 
very reasonable price and it looks nice to . 
i am writing this after having used them for about two years . 
coffee can pack down and become solid crust . 
for some reason they just cannot seem to get it right . 
the fact that it fit so well surprised me . 
the way the rod is offset works really nicely . 
i got this accessory when i purchased my first foodsaver many years ago . 
with just a few strokes you can easily clean up an edge . 
i was a little skeptical about this charger since it was so cheap . 
with the pasta roller it made the task so easy and totally entertaining . 
if you are looking for a light weight cookie sheet this will work . 
just nice soft fluffy rice . cleaning it afterwards was easy . 
i had to walk outside the house so i can see it clearly . 
but what sets it apart is its versatility . 
installing it is not trivially easy ,  but is definitely possible . 
i knew lodge castiron pans had a strong and reliable reputation . 
plastic stains and absorbs odors ,  while glass does not . 
easy to keep clean since you can easily get your hand down inside . 
they are made very nicely ,  very shiny and heavy . 
this apple adapter gave me just what i needed . 
the grated rind falls off the microplane pretty much of its own volition . 
this set would be a perfect gift for a new home . 
these can t really go bad and will last a lifetime . 
other than that ,  i like it just fine . 
simply put ,  this car charger is so great for the price . 
ever since i bought the oreck air purifier ,  his sneezing has stopped . 
the filters last for the specified time and arrive in a timely manner . 
mine is currently holding num_num utensils ,  including large whisks . 
the handset is plastic ,  but finished with a satin feel . 
i am glad i purchased this little picher . 
the nonstick finish seems to be pretty good also . 
her health wason and off ,  up and down for awhile . 
this is a very pretty case for those that really like purple . 
i got it for really cheap and it worked as expected . 
it was the amazon basics one which seemed to hold up very well . 
so cleanup is a breeze . third ,  this whole thing is solid . 
it serves its purpose at a great price . 
i really love my new little bluetooth headset . 
the can take a high heat no problem and are easy to clean . 
and the lock switch is lined up perfectly with the hole for it . 
the other two i have purchased have been for gifts . 
product works as is advertised to protect your screen from scratches . 
they are thick glass and hard to break . 
we thought it maybe a little expensive for just a pitcher . 
hold up well and are easy to put on . 
clean up is so simple and quick too . 
slow means it probably took num_num minutes to stuff num_extend worth of sausage . 
good quality and good quantity for its price . 
i checked for one on amazon . com ,  and there it was . 
this case is everything indicated ,  except for the color . 
this is the only hoover bagged model with a full num_num year warranty . 
i hardly feel it on my ear and i can hear callers clearly . 
it is a blender ,  after all and will make noise . 
can use the phone as i lay in bed . 
i just love the useful stuff i find on amazon . 
i really like this phone holder for when i ride the bike . 
so ,  this mandoline certainly has its pluses and has many uses . 
still on my first one after num_num months about with no bubbles . 
wife visiting grandkids a few states away asked for a small saucepan . 
all clad offers a variety of exterior finishes to suit your taste . 
i love using this for carrots ,  cukes ,  zucchini and sweet potatoes . 
my sister and brother both have one and love them too . 
i can t say enough about the quality of this pan . 
everything is ground to an absolutely fine powdery consistency . 
my wife is the love of my life . 
this is a great tool to cook with . 
i use this to vacuum seal my soup and dips . 
then i had my mother s friend s rum cake . 
ground up num_num lbs of turkey breast for sausage . 
life is too short to be stuck with inadequate kitchen tools !  !  . 
what more can i say ,  the name itself says it all . 
i workout a lot and my arms are num_extend
fiesta delivered the dishes ahead of schedule and in perfect condition . 
can t say enough positive things about this item . 
i ve used mine steadily for months with zero problems . 
i turn the pan over and heat the other side for another minute . 
first off let s talk about data management and sharing . 
now ,  i can drink plenty of water without enduring that bitter taste . 
it works wonderfully and is made to fit any space . 
wusthoff scores again ,  to my great cooking pleasure !  . 
 btw they cooked faster than my electronic steamer which it replaced . 
no problems with the quality after num_num weeks . 
it s not fancy ,  but a good value for the money . 
the top on the carafe seems to work smoothly . 
washes up like a dream in the dishwasher too . 
the small headset fits seamlessly inside its  stone  for charging . 
i ve tried all three and each time came out perfect . 
easy to use and set up was a breeze . 
it arrived in perfect condition and works as advertised . 
walkman is good ,  but could use a little more human factors work . 
this is my second purchase of exactly the same skillet . 
it has all samsung logo and upc code . 
in nyc ,  i only noticed it when crossing streets . 
we got this for my husband s phone and he likes it alot . 
use that idle microwave to melt the butter . 
my only regret is that it was made in china . 
one final disclosure i feel i should make . 
it actually makes the phone look more expensive . 
this one is ,  knives are easy to access and replace when done . 
maybe if they  read the instructions  they wouldn t be having any troubles . 
this spatula is great for just about everything . 
it s a good compromise between safety ,  style and function . 
toasters typically don t do that ,  so you must . 
it die drop in the grass but still worked . 
the colors it emits charging and charged are very cool . 
this is at least twice as fast as the iron . 
the bronzed rings i got looked somewhat rusty in appearance . 
i did find some bad reviews about num_extend
good thing i have a spare one for when his finally breaks !  . 
i decided to keep it and use it anyway . 
whole family has allergies and some sort of asthma l . 
you can t help but focus on it ,  and it s gorgeous . 
so glad i purchased the culligan filters for our kitchen faucet . 
perfect for salsa s and for mincing onions and garlic for dishes . 
shipped very fast and i love the screen protectors; exactly what i ordered . 
overall these bags are good ,  and they re a convenient size . 
these are very easy to use and high quality measuring cups . 
i would recommend it to anyone without reservation . 
they are complicated to clean and one is complicated to even assemble . 
it s great !  it even has instruction images on the device itself . 
it doesn t make blades razor sharp but does a decent job . 
i ve also frozen fresh herbs in water for use in soups . 
i knew i would love it ,  i mean come on . 
do expect shipping to take some time on these . 
verizon wanted $ for it !  amazon asked for way less than that . 
i use the whip the most ,  so far . 
for the price on these ,  they work very well . 
the whole family can have a different color at any time . 
the gobel is also slightly harder to see through . 
i agree with all of the positive reviews on this site . 
just enough to moisten it ,  before putting it down on the surface . 
these things are great ,  and definitely worth the price . 
it s great for browning meats and does a mean deglazing . 
it was too bright for me and i didn t use as much . 
i m amazed at the difference between other brands . 
do not even bother cleaning the copper strip . 
these are perfect for lunches and for home use . 
did i mention mine was shipped with a heat reflector shield ?  num_extend
comes with an allen wrench ,  that s all you need . 
we have another stand alone steamer mop and it is just . 
i first tried this brand on my ipad . 
it charges and that is all i cared about when i needed it . 
will determine how long it s going to last . 
over all a good idea and a good price . 
with this phone ,  i have forwarded my pager . 
we needed a rack that would hold a minimum of num_num bottles . 
well made and grates ptarmigan like a champ . 
i love opening the cupboard to all the bright colors and fun shapes . 
it seemed like it had the best reviews for the price . 
the mostly stay flat so far i kept push it down . 
this opens num_num degrees and it s easy to clean . 
this food slicer met our expectations on ease of use and cleaning . 
these are by far better and less messy . 
it really helps protect the phones from scratches . 
i can simmer gravy ,  reduce pie filling ,  and fry eggs . 
the filter paper is somewhat heavier than other filters . 
it does pay to shop around with attention to shipping costs . 
it steams the corn kernels very swiftly in microwave . 
i have to stop myself from peeling more garlic than i need !  . 
this was is by far better than my last one . 
i had this cup for at least num_num years . 
perfect for a handful of ice cubes and some soda or iced tea . 
so just switch back and forth for dices . 
and it looks like it will last forever . 
i can live with that for how much time it saves me . 
a hearty rap and tilting action releases the gross . 
much more convenient cleanup than oil in a pot . 
i think that would be the next smaller size choice . 
can t complain about something a product is not made to do . 
i have used these timers for many years and have worn them out . 
this important blade was not included in the num_extend model i bought . 
it was easy to hook up ,  and the sound quality is excellent . 
i tried adding less to the bowl ,  same result . 
the motor is very powerful and i highly recommend this product . 
she was showing off some monster size ricers . 
clear sound on both ends with hearing and microphone . 
i bought it to keep blades and discs easy and safe to reach . 
works perfect with the fabric drawers that i purchased with it . 
the wire slicer is num_extend inches num_extend cm  long . 
this skillet is almost commercial size in my opinion . 
i have purchased severalfor different friends and they all love it . 
ordered this hoping it would solve the problem . 
there was no need to scream to be heard . 
i m using stainless steel and cast iron in my kitchen . 
i wish i had bought one of these long ago . 
i just wish i had added chunks of chocolate . 
i thought it might be fun ,  it wasn t . 
theyarrive sharp ,  stay sharp ,  and are easy to resharpen when necessary . 
it looks cool being of the same metal as the silverware it holds . 
it is light weight ,  easy to put together and easy to use . 
i think a lot of that was due to the wok itself . 
it s a great little cooker and doesn t take up much space . 
i ve owned the roomba now for about num_num months . 
the temperature for cooking and toasting items is perfect . 
that one part operates the flow into the carafe . 
cuisinart has made the best one of the num_num i ve tried . 
it works extremely well and is very convienient . 
i laugh seeing prices at the stores knowing i got a better deal . 
i purchased this to get the dog food from the can . 
the cable is sturdy and fit nicely on a samsung phone . 
i bought this set for myself and have been very happy so far . 
application was very easy and the end result is perfect . 
she did a num_num way call ,  and talked for hours . 
i got it and it was fully charged ,  when was a plus . 
until now i used tape or cardboard for transport . 
there is a reason for that ,  they are good and they work . 
this filter mechanism then screws onto the bottom of the stem . 
i love it ,  one of the best gifts i ve received . 
i can t say enough good things about this pan . 
but it wasn t the first thing she mentioned . 
the true test is if the edges cling to the screen . 
you also can t use heavy scrubbers or metal implements on it . 
these tortilla shell pans was exactly what we wanted . 
i have had a screwpull for over num_num years . 
it slices yukon gold potatoes with lots of effort . 
and i like the handle although some people don t seem to . 
these are perfect !  they re sturdy and very pretty . 
that s what you are asked to do with a new pan . 
these tortilla bowl makers are just what i needed . 
my only real complaint is the led power indicator . 
my only negative is the small power on switch . 
that s really all the bells and whistles you need . 
easy to clean and well worth the money !  . 
this year i decided to take the plunge . 
this four piece set looks beautiful in my kitchen . 
this is my second copy of this phone . 
i have one in red and blue for my younger sons . 
i switched to these after many years of replacing broken glass press carafes . 
my num_num year old pusher sleeve broke when dropped during thanksgiving preparation . 
this was probably the best decision in a while . 
it s heavy ,  but i don t mind it s weight . 
this is much better than the less expensive ,  cheap screen protectors . 
i lose these cables pretty easily and need replacements often . 
certainly ,  there are digital pots that cost much more . 
i bought them to replace my henckle s that finally broke . 
whatever mode you use ,  it will count down a time . 
i do recommend spraying well with cooking spray prior to use . 
i decided to give these a try before i threw the icon out . 
this whisk is great for making sauces and scrambling eggs . 
it has great pick up power and as rugged as the sweeper itself . 
perhaps it was just a fluke bad part but certainly disappointing . 
so each week i am peeling the organic items i purchase for her . 
have not cooked rice or pasta with it . 
i always hated to heat up my large num_num qt . 
this was way nicer than i expected it to be . 
i am very happy with the quality of this set of flatware . 
i trust the name and so should you . 
having a decent turn by turn maps app . 
great case for the money ,  and then some . 
i would find something that is just as stylish but more protective . 
we ve been pleased with it ,  and have not had any problems . 
the little buggers will move on or stay away . 
this is often the first board i reach for . 
purchased this for my wife and she loves it . 
looks good ,  has some grip to it ,  does the job . 
this is a great oil free option for cooking . 
we enjoy the skillet anyway . i hope you find this review helpful . 
you could get a cheaper one for $
i reapply the walnut oil a couple times a week now . 
there is a very short learning curve with this device . 
the arm of the mount is fairly long . 
the color is bright and really cool to look at . 
overall ,  i ve been very pleased with the phone . 
it was the worst phone i have ever used . 
well ,  i now have a quickie original bowl brush and caddy . 
i love to cook yet for years put off buying a food processor . 
i read the reviews and bought this one . 
each one also came in its one plastic sleeve . 
braun completely rethought the design ,  with excellent results . 
they are an excellent inexpensive gift when you visit someone . 
the cap stays on ,  the lid easily comes off . 
the handles do get hot ,  but i knew that before i ordered . 
they need to include some instructions with it . 
it s rough ,  and then there are  slick bars  between the roughness . 
it is stamped  us shelby co  and works great . 
this steamer is made of very good materials and is very durable . 
these would make an considerate yet inexpensive house gift as well . 
it is easy to use ,  cleans up with no problems . 
but not enough for me to want to remove the case . 
i purchased this masher today and wasnt surprised at the quality . 
i also like that it s retractable and has a cool blue light . 
  i have a different one i like  . 
everything slides right off  even the delicate lacey cookies  . 
all i can say is this case looks great ,  and fits great . 
wow ,  i have never received such a signal . 
power button is slightly hard to press but not too bad . 
the most secure way to exercise and listen to your music or news . 
i bought the pink coffee maker as a birthday gift to someone . 
she enjoyed hers so much that i bought one for myself . 
i would gladly buy more and buy them as gifts for others . 
it was still cold with ice cubes unmelted at num_num pm . 
phone to bluetooth signal quality is great indoors . 
long announcement when you turn fm mode back on . 
they burn easily and begin to fray around the edges . 
recommend if you need to think about your budget . 
if it lasts a year ,  it s only $
my wife loved this thing while she had it . 
exactly what i wanted ,  with the exception of the size . 
you may have recalled a previous apple slicer review of mine . 
it works well for my butter chicken sauce too . 
but ,  i was still worried about protecting my iphone num_extend
shipping was extremely prompt . by the way ,  there is no steam . 
what could possibly be wrong with cupcake cups . 
this combo pack is great and includes num_num very useful sizes . 
you have to stop it when it has extracted enough water . 
this carpet cleaner kicks butt ,  it puts that old bissell to shame . 
of all the blenders i ve tried ,  i really like this one . 
this opener is almost easier than an electric . 
i don t know if this is for everyone or just me . 
i mean really who needs a plastic springy thing on it . 
the good grips line features durable ,  nonslip flexible handles on every product . 
garmins are picky about their usb cables and chargers . 
i absolutely love this oil dispenser and measuring device . 
i honestly almost passed this presto powerpop gadget up . 
it reaches pressure quickly ,  and the pressure releases quickly when through cooking . 
this one only has one control temperature for the long slots . 
the clean surge seemed like a gimmick but is pretty handy for stains . 
my mother had been wanting one of these for a while . 
at the junction ,  it is another foot to the ear hooks . 
not much to say about this other than . 
i ve had no issues with this handle cover at all . 
perfect item and does what its supposed to do ,  which is nice . 
powerpoint also recognized it and entered presentation mode . 
i just received the shipment and the quality is excellent . 
it is just what i was looking for . 
but it is deeper and less sloped than this one . 
the machine today is the same quality as my last one . 
it makes a nice presentation which is also very important to me . 
the protector fit great and almost had a mirror effect to it . 
this case is just perfect for what i needed . 
it s very safe and easy to use for clumsy fingers like mine . 
the suction is quite good and the filter is a big plus . 
this one does it well ,  with ease and stays clean . 
this one from interdeisgn is mold free and stays put . 
very neat and hardly ever have to clean it . 
the num_extend amp charger works quickly for the phone . 
this was not explicitly stated in the install instructions . 
install was a breeze and the fit is perfect . 
there has to be another similar machine that does this same thing . 
that doesn t reflect on the quality of this pin ,  however . 
first thing in the morning ,  take it out for the day . 
the num_extend pen allowed him to write smaller . 
fiestaware is durable and pretty in the kitchen . 
it s also great for cooking dried beans or cabbage . 
i bought this headset to use in while driving . 
i ve used this num_num tier bamboo steamer a handful of times . 
measurements are clearly stamped on each spoon and easy to see . 
holds trash bags well ,  even filled with beer bottles . 
it is just now starting to break down on me . 
i typically use mine to store celery in water . 
besides shortbread i also use it to make brownies . 
like all le creuset products ,  this one is awesome too . 
slight style different ,  but like i said ,  works fine . 
been using it for num_num years and it is great . 
it can be used for just about anything . 
it fired right up with first strike of my flint starter . 
this did the trick ,  and did it cheaply . 
num_extend did a nice job on this one . 
it s a perfect size for almost anything i need . 
i blame my computer as calls with the iphone sounded pretty good . 
clean up is a breeze and the flavor and quality is suburb !  . 
perfect for big batches ,  but not too big to store easily . 
buy this thing !  !  best can opener i have ever used . 
the zinc or cast aluminum construction just did not hold up . 
not really that great ,  but not really that bad either . 
okay for bottom of dishwasher they are heavy . 
if you accidentally bump the stack ,  they all go tumbling down . 
i am very ,  very pleased for the price . 
the build up of black particles comes off easy . 
therefore they have made up silly reasons as a justification . 
even the old osterizer with its removable center part sealed completely . 
this is a typical soft silicone case for the iphone num_extend
i have always wanted a kitchen aid mixer . 
the material feels fantastic holding in hands ,  definitely in good quality . 
i also bought a pressure cooker cook book at the same time . 
this is a great dresser ,  but doesn t fit too much . 
especially when you re decorating with several different color icings !  . 
works great in place of my big fingers . 
the construction is pretty solid and doesn t budge at all . 
i keep it as a spare now ,  but highly recommend it . 
note :  make sureyou get hooks into a stud . 
thanks amazon for having your one day sale . 
i go with them anytime there is an option for the most part . 
i don t know what we did without this . 
i bought the  original  jawbone when it was released . 
this is my second black and decker food chopper . 
it never has damaged a battery on my phones . 
overall for the price this is a great set of dishes . 
i can t wait to clean my cars with it . 
i can t say enough great things about this pan . 
i have had this item for several months now and i love it . 
the calphalon s finish shows many more scratches and num_extend denser anodized finish . 
this is a great fan esp for the money . 
the overall look of the unit is fantastic . 
i have seen ours navigate very effectively num_extend from the cube . 
i recommended it but long term use should be considered when buying it . 
heard the brouhaha over the dyson ,  so i checked it out . 
so i clean them out after every use  hence num_extend not num_num stars  . 
there is a noticeable delay in taking motion pictures . 
i feel the price was right and will be getting another one . 
you can find cheaper bags but you get what you pay for . 
maybe for bigger batch of herb ,  it will be more useful . 
just swap the battery out if i need to late in the day . 
i could tell the difference as soon as i started using it . 
there s no worry of it coming off unexpectedly . 
i would definitely recommend it to a friend . 
holds up very well and cleans up easily . 
i guess samsung wants their phones are only compatible with samsung bluetooth headset . 
i bought this to use as my kitchen pantry . 
remove it from your oven and let it cool on your stove top . 
it holds num_num bottles of your favorite sparkling wine . 
these iphone protectors are good quality for a great price . 
was looking for a long time for something like this and it works . 
so be warned you will have to do two steps with this machine . 
for the money this is was a very good purchase . 
all in all ,  this worked great for my small christmas ham . 
they are nice and heavy and feel good in your hand . 
kitchenaid with this attachment can make the ice creams easily . 
i was surprised to see have nice it looked in person . 
if you hang these you can double or triple up these . 
actually ,  this num_num cup thing is num_num mug of coffee . 
i use one for espresso to check my temperature . 
unfortunately ,  it still measures below the old honeywell units . 
really wish this grinder had a removable cup that collects the grinds . 
this brush is well made with the known oxo good grips handle . 
one charges the ipod and one charges and sends information . 
i intend to use it when i replace my ear bud . 
this is my second and i plan to buy at least two more . 
it is easy to clean and easy to put back together . 
it has been moved to my camper for many more years of use . 
i loved my first oven so much that i went and got another . 
the look great and feel good in the hand . 
nice size handle to hold onto to cut my pie crust strips . 
i think i will stick with this phone for a good long time . 
i use the same pot to can the extra . 
i use them for everything from ice cream to bake sales . 
anyway this case is slim and very protective . 
don t be fooled by the advertising and do research on ratings . 
as i said this ear piece is very comfortable . 
a very nice set of pure white china . 
i got this tripod to take videos with my samsung galaxy num_extend
it also rattles when closed ,  which annoys me . 
it really helps with sticking and clean up afterwards . 
it will fit in nicely with my two larger cookers . 
pizza stones ,  pizza crust made out of tortillas etc . 
he was able to easily roll out dough for cinnamon rolls . 
well ive used it for a week now and i love it . 
works well ,  but does not fit all ranges . 
just wish it had a little more power . 
had a pampered chef one and it broke ,  so went with oxo . 
and unlike radios the music goes where i go . 
i ve had other salad spinners and this one is far better . 
i was surprised how big the spinner was when i received it . 
perhaps amazon will correct it by the time you read this review . 
it was comparable to spinning yarn into gold thread . 
i am absolutely delighted with my chef s casserole . 
i created my own labels with avery template . 
grind your favorite coffee bean fine  or use finely ground fresh coffee  . 
the product was shipped promply and packaged approximately . 
i have been having a blast making these quesadillas with this . 
i have had this unit for a month now and really like it . 
it does a good job of shredding the potatoes . 
you can only time one thing at a time . 
there s simply no other coffee device that does what a press does . 
my daughter and i decided we d like to try them . 
seems to hold up to moderate use just fine . 
seems to last a long time on the regular batteries . 
i had to drill a small hole myself . 
i would say that i use the meat grinder the most . 
some foods just cook better with clad in my opinion . 
yes it is cheaply made and the cord is very short . 
my wooden cutting board looks and feels so good again . 
i ll be ordering them throughout this year as num_extend christmas list gifts . 
but ,  i m happy enough that i will not return them . 
the drip coffee tastes a bit muddy to me by comparison . 
it had carmelized red onion with a balsamic reduction . 
as usual ,  otterbox is the way to go when protecting your smartphone . 
by far it has the best assembly to keep in your ear . 
it annoys me every time i use it . 
this is only a num_num amp charger ,  and does work very well . 
i needed to hold it down while grinding . 
i think this is a genuine palm battery . 
thank god for all the  how to  sites on the web . 
snaps on easily and it feels like it really protects the phone . 
my only complaint about this machine ,  is the color . 
i was skeptical but gave this one a try . 
this is a very good quality micro plane . 
it holds it nicely and the fit is perfect . 
i would have preferred to season it myself . 
the metal actually pulls some of the oil off the food . 
i have my own email server and couldn t find all the settings . 
the stainless steel pot and cover clean up easily . 
the cover has information on the temperatures recommended for various types of meats . 
bought this because of the price and reviews . 
the small size works great for a decent sized lunch salad . 
be sure to use the little measuring cup that comes with the unit . 
very happy with the belkin charge set so far . 
when the beep sounds ,  you have to go . 
this was a gift for my brothers iphone . 
the cake came out of this pan flawlessly ,  no sticking at all . 
kind of wish it had a hole for hanging . 
i m sure that this would work great in the oven too !  . 
but other than that i love the gadget . 
being able to remove the lid without touching it is a bonus . 
love the way it helps me in the kitchen . 
i have other kitchenaid tools and equipment and all are work horses . 
ive managed to pour it in without spilling so far too . 
the result is that they can seesaw a bit . 
could i do this ?  yes i could and did . 
these seem to be fine for the price . 
the back fits even though i have an extended battery installed . 
i ve always been torn between the moto and plantronics brand headsets . 
the cheese and sauce literally rinsed right off . 
i only upgraded to android to be able to watch youtube at work . 
i have been using this grinder daily for a little over a month . 
i love these measuring spoons so much that i have two sets . 
connections fit perfectly and powered my koolatron nicely . 
between this flavor and the original ,  it can t be beat . 
brita came before pur and everyone loved it . 
her mom had some lodge ,  a big deep like num_num qt . 
also usefull to measure electric energy consumption for any number of home appliances . 
its stereo is great ,  connects instantly ,  is light weight . 
the scoop handles are easy to grip and they release the dough easily . 
tired of the wife melting the inferior models . 
and hour later i tried it again and it was ok . 
giving away my luminarc juice set of glasses to my neighbor . 
it immediately became one of my  top shelf  kitchen gadgets . 
however ,  the suction cups are protected and last for years . 
it has a hepa filter that catches num_extend micron particles or larger . 
clip is strong enough to hook on jeans pocket . 
the way it feels in my hands is different . 
so i am very happy with this purchase so far . 
i only wish they make this one in smaller size . 
get a steamer insert ,  and the num_num qt piece is perfect . 
you can synchronize your photos ,  ringtones and sms messages as well . 
there are lots of options in this price range . 
talk time is about six hours . overall this unit sounds great . 
these headphones work well to cancel out background noise . 
that means that i m very comfortable using a pen for input . 
the spoon part tapers from a width of approx . 
i only have one con :  the buttons are really hard to press . 
thinkfree mobile; to create microsoft office compatible docs that will sync with google num_extend
they work fine and last a long time . 
both sides are independent for controls and independently reversable . 
one of the best kitchen purchases i have ever made . 
i bought this pan for my husband who loves meatloaf . 
i ordered this thinking it would be great since it is currently summer . 
those with weak wrists and arms need not apply . 
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new kettle . 
the product showed up when it was supposed to . 
i have to use a big pot ,  like this one . 
the installation was fairly easy and the ipod touch works like new now . 
i started looking for replacement chargers and came upon this particular model . 
it s condensation from the steam and moisture that was retained . 
the chicken or anything else for that matter burns before it cooks . 
works well and cleans up well in the dishwasher . 
very easy to put phone in and take out . 
the power holds a long time after a full charge . 
i didn t realize how many knives i had until i hung them . 
saves a lot of room in the freezer . 
i have two of these that i use together . 
the case is awesome ,  fits the phone nicely and looks really sharp . 
it writes smoothly like a quality pen would write . 
i will just have to use it and see !  !  . 
hot water is only as hot as you can get from the tap . 
it is compact and easy to carry in your briefcase . 
since then he s had a plastic bag covering it . 
it is a great pan for frittata and omelets as well . 
i use them for wine ,  including sparkling wine and various oils . 
mine  laps over  many of my pans ,  but it works fine anyways . 
the female plug has a tighter fit and no play . 
i was very happy when the cell phone industry standardized their charging ports . 
these are the exact ones i had when i had a blackberry . 
also ,  this product is very easy to clean . 
what can i say ?  does what its supposed it . 
the current  n  model is also cosmetically nicer than the prior version . 
i got a lot of complaints about talking on my phone without it . 
the brew switch is an odd ,  small ,  sharp lever . 
how do you cook brown rice ?  not a clue . 
i am licensed to do so in num_num states . 
this knife does large vegetables slicing or mincing of onion or garlic . 
i have continual requests to  cook it  in the dutch oven . 
we haven t tried using the num_extend port as well . 
and the standing rib roast is done perfectly . 
coffee iced tea maker served me faithfully for many years . 
they don t grab too much ,  thus preventing food from tearing . 
hats off to the guy who brought this in from the carpentry shed . 
this one does it just like it should . 
i really like these rolls of bags for my foodsaver . 
it hasn t rusted on us ,  and it feels very sturdy . 
i don t have smaller versions to compare quality to . 
these work great for my polk num_extend speaker set . 
yes ,  it is lightweight but that is it s advantage . 
they were ok but had the same limitations as the melitta . 
the included pads are too tiny to securely place the speaker . 
i tend to be pretty skeptical of bluetooth headsets . 
i was wrong ,  i even bought another for my sisters ipod . 
i rarely drive ,  i m usually riding the motorcycle wherever i go . 
it is worth every penny just for the ease and speed when peeling . 
the most troublesome cookies just slide right off . 
overall good product but its something to get use to . 
this is my first fiesta ware item and i love it . 
very elegant !  they have a nice weight and wash up well . 
it worked very well ,  even without the usual camping legs . 
i would recommend this to my best friend any day . 
it cleaned up well without any buckling so is a keeper . 
i use my smaller skillets almost dailey and this works well with them . 
they re just standard depth drawers top to bottom . 
my husband enjoys two oversized mugs of tea in the morning . 
i use it all the time for a multitude of recipes . 
more than functional ,  the water tastes great in it . 
makes a very good cup of coffee quickly . 
 water in nw arkansas taste like lake ,  dirt ,  filth  . 
it seems to have plenty of torque considering it is vacuum powered . 
we make dough from scratch every week at least once . 
they operate very smoothly and i am never concerned about dropping food . 
it s a beautiful color and slides on very easily . 
oddly enough ,  you can actually  hear  when your water is boiling . 
it does weigh a lot ,  but it s very solid . 
units made by plantronics or jawbone ,  though other quality units also exist . 
it had some neat features ,  but i was overall disappointed with it . 
the case looks quite good and is also easy and comfortable to hold . 
if you re looking for cheap ,  rugged case this one is great . 
this little kettle boils a liter of water in a few minutes flat . 
it will certainly protect my samsung galaxy num_extend
i was able to split my micro usb power wire to two devices . 
there are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream . 
only gripe is i wish it had more velcro . 
the ipad tends to slide down if i have it standing sideways . 
as is you have to but bobbin on bottom then put thread on . 
they work great and hold the vacuum well . 
i bought these for my phone cause i drop it a lot . 
this case is so great i bought another one . 
i ve been using these dishes for about three years now . 
the defrost option does indeed work ,  and so does the warming option . 
we were very pleased with how well it pops corn . 
it is a bit too thick for smaller hands . 
it last longer as bold doesnt have touch screen . 
this may or many not be a pro or a con . 
not sure what else to say about a good battery . 
it has all kinds of markings on it next to the degree markings . 
please do not use a baking spray on this pan . 
great for brewing water for teas ,  hot chocolate and other hot drinks . 
i bought this stone as a gift for my daughter at christmas . 
second ,  device has only medium shredding cone in the original package . 
great product for keeping liquids hot for long periods of time . 
i use it twice a day ,  every day minimum . 
i love to organize and this works great . 
for the price i paid ,  it was well worth it . 
the otterbox impact series case is a good case and offers great protection . 
first ,  rinsing the filter is in your best interest . 
it s great value for the product that you receive . 
these cases are very nice for the price . 
just love my new microplane professional extra coarse grater . 
i bring it in the shower often to listen to pandora without incident . 
easy dry install ,  very easy to remove bubbles and dust stickers are num_extend
i even adapted one to be a cover for mixing dry ingredients . 
 i gather some generic replacements are not as good .   . 
i love that i can easily switch from floor to carpet . 
you can only charge the jabra easygo via usb . 
the professional num_num is my first stand mixer . 
this pot is very nice for soups and is a good value . 
nuts to the naysayers that complain of battery life . 
the crimps on the sides make it easy to hold . 
the machine picks up so well that bags fill up . 
i found familiar scotches revealing unknown flavors and aromas . 
this looks like it will last for a very long time . 
it s a great skillet and i use it often . 
had some problems with bubbles ,  but that was my fault . 
purchased it through amazon from a num_extend party vendor . 
will also make great diced carrots ,  beets ,  and potato allumette . 
the fit all around is excellent and the inside is very soft . 
i had forgotten what really good popcorn tastes like . 
i ve had it for num_num months now and love it . 
these are so much better than an electric blanket because heat rises . 
they are great ,  they are very sturdy ,  well made . 
nice and compact and easy to store when not in use . 
by the next num_num minutes ,  it was fully charged . 
it stores well ,  with the food baskets fitting into one another . 
i let the pan cool and cleaned it out really good . 
i know ,  weird ,  but i really feel strongly about this !  . 
i wish someone had warned me about the bad reputation of mr . 
this has lasted us years and cuts pizza so we can eat it . 
my initial response was ,  needs more heat so cranked up the burner . 
i would definitely recommend these as a low cost alternative to higher brand . 
it is well made and fits securely over the num_extend
on a good day with no issues ,  it s awesome . 
i love this set of cookware !  first ,  it cooks evenly . 
we bought it so we could tie up chicken . 
let s say carpet cleaning is no my big thrill in life . 
the battery lasts about one hour ,  which is ok . 
i have an electric stove so the flat bottom is a must . 
and they have more tissues in them than some packages . 
i have num_num boys and they all love waffles . 
my num_extend hard drive was recognised and the videos and pic play . 
i must admit that i was a skeptic ,  but not any more . 
most of the time ,  both ports were being used simultaneously . 
works great and my daughter loves the protection it gives her . 
so far ,  this oxo can opener has lasted the longest . 
she made me give it to her as her birthday present . 
but this one was not ,  it was actually decent . 
couldn t be happier and the price is fantastic !  . 
it has been on since i got it pretty much . 
i doubt i will need a new gasket for a long time . 
one for mom s phone and one for my partner s phone . 
the brushed stainless with the polished stainless is very snazzy . 
i ve had it for num_num years and it s still going strong . 
 learned by bitter experience .   additionally ,  stay away from high heat . 
i have owned this for num_num months and i m quite satisfied . 
works fine for both iphone s at the same time no problems . 
sharper than my old one ,  larger ,  and definitely easy to use . 
this case provides a great amount of protection . 
i have used paper towels for the last time to reheat leftovers . 
i love that it can be used in three positions . 
this is a really nice set at a reasonable price . 
i have the iphone num_extend and it works well with it . 
this goes with the bon appetite recipe book to provide extra pages . 
but i cant say i used it alot . 
this is the main complaint that i have . 
at last minute found this and read reviews . 
the reality is better ,  far better ,  than i had hoped for . 
it s not going to tidy up for you ,  too . 
anything you get from pyrex is always good . 
have not had a chance to put it into my truck yet . 
the vacation cabin we rented recently had one of these in the kitchen . 
the quality ,  price ,  value ,  and dust free installation are unbeatable . 
the glass is thick which is very nice . 
they probably still work for their current owner as well . 
and i love that it can be taken apart . 
i can t imagine how it would scratch the glass top . 
my old one would wake the neighborhood . highly recommended product . 
make your own  poor man   latte with it . 
be sure to thoroughly clean the filter after each use . 
interestingly ,  each of ours has its own distinct sound . 
would highly recommend for anyone needing a phone repaired !  . 
the rest of the install was a breeze . the unit just works . 
what sold me on this brand is that the tops are stainless steel . 
i am so delighted with my brand new everyday pan . 
i can t believe what a difference they make . 
it can be removed with a vegetable brush or any other brush . 
line the grease catcher with foil for easier cleaning . 
they work great and she is able to operate them easily . 
i had gotten used to having vacuuming being a huge chore . 
considering that the darn thing was based on num_extend technology but manufactured the num_extend
a perfect well made stainless pan that will last a lifetime . 
the second night i did not have a headache in the morning . 
just make sure you follow the directions and really perfect fluffy rice . 
enough to thaw out the bread without really cooking it . 
used it for five years ,  then bought a second one . 
i can t say if this happens with centrifugal juicers like this model . 
than you fit the rubber outer coat over the core . 
i love to cook !  this little pot is becoming a favorite . 
calls are much clearer and noise cancellation is much better . 
the sound is good ,  and the build is good . 
it is easy to set up and easy to learn to use . 
i went num_num years using knives bought cheaply at garage sales . 
i made my own by using velcro straps  see link below  . 
the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar . 
it looks great !  candy apple red and seems well made . 
i did get to download ngage games and that was kewl . 
the lid stays put and it s easy to clean . 
i would recommend purchasing the other  rockers  for different pressure requirements . 
also will fit with an extended battery  again their specific type  . 
just plug in a charger and set it on your desk or dresser . 
but it fits and even the old food pusher fits in the opening . 
this is the best sponge caddy i ve ever had . 
sometimes that seems like forever but it s pretty seamless . 
this pan can go straight from the oven to the table . 
coffee s definition of a cup is num_num oz . 
this is more or less my  personal  sized coffee maker . 
i used this mifi for more than num_num years . 
i can shred num_num lb of carrots in minutes . 
make sure you have a  case friendly  screen protector though . 
i d give it num_num stars if i could . 
he said it works very well for the storage of certain foods . 
i can t imagine a better case for my needs . 
on my countertop ,  and water makes the bowl slip . 
i can keep my phone protected and still hear it when it rings . 
the edge is thin enough to get underneath the cookie . 
i use them both daily  one at work ,  and one at home  . 
ordered these head phones and they work fine . 
other than that it looks exactly as pictured . 
mic placement can be a little tricky at first . 
remember that you need to remove any skin or cover before plugging it num_extend
it cancels out the background noise really well . 
i love my offset spatula for spreading melted chocolate . 
it has a sensor outside the unit and gives a digital reading . 
but the case is excellent ,  screen protectors give it a shot . 
it works as advertised and is easy to use . 
does everything it s supposed to do and does it well . 
i drive a num_extend suv with noisy deep tread tires . 
would recommend if num_extend is what you need . 
the case is perfect ,  flexible and has a nice look . 
but the hardware is not where this phone distinguishes itself . 
now it s like a tank and there are no worries . 
i make all kinds of foods on this grill . 
i m surprised by the number of one star reviews . 
the cup markings are clearly deliniated in red . 
just used this for the first time last night . 
the others are too cheap to work right . 
just slip the garlic clove in the tube and roll . 
this is a plus . my main aim is to protect the porcelain . 
i highly recommend this set and the price was right . 
just be careful and i see no problems . 
it is very nice for controlling the grind size of your coffee . 
keeps unsightly trash hidden and out of the way . 
my only complain is the cord is too short . 
i use this to mount my galaxy num_extend and num_extend in my car . 
the unit is quiet ,  grinds very well and according to settings . 
all in all ,  probably the most reliable thing you can get for $
i have one under the kitchen sink and one under my bathroom sink . 
i m not wasting water or coffee and have taken it with me . 
pyrex will last for anyone s  forever  if used properly . 
my only complaint was putting it together was annoying . 
have you ever tried to crush grind up fennel seeds . 
it is a great whisk and appears very good quality . 
so this is a cheap way to add some shelving . 
better than nordic ware and i have both . 
now ,  i can have all my texts and emails read to me . 
i ve been looking for a new coffee maker for a long while . 
how i use it : i wear this while biking to work . 
i can t wait to start making cookies this holiday season . 
the weighted bottom part is crystal clear and solid . 
for the money ,  this canner is great and makes it so easy . 
all in all i am very satisfied with the performance . 
these are very convenient to use and dishwasher safe . 
so it help me to protect from strach . 
it does exactly what i wanted it to do . 
i got this as a gift for my mom . 
very pleased with the quality and ease of use . 
the rectangle is easier to move out of the way on my counter . 
i cannot give a higher recommendation !  the seller delivered on time . 
it seems better than the original jawbone and is far less bulky . 
the great advantage is that they re thin and can be stored easily . 
num_extend off you need to know these are very heavy . 
i purchased this fireplace for the ambiance of the fireplace . 
conversely ,  too coarse of a grind will make a nice americano . 
last time my wife had something like this was years ago . 
i researched them extensively and none offer this feature . 
it is nice and heavy ,  the picture does it justice . 
great to have at the grill or oven . 
i fully expect it to be the last tea kettle i purchase . 
the recipes in the book are very good as well . 
it s worth the num_num or num_num extra dollars for the armored . 
you could handle bigger veggies and have a longer stroke to work with . 
the item works ,  just not what i wanted it for . 
the quality is exactly what you expect from henckels . 
it definitely compliments the iphone rather than dominates it . 
num_num minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked . 
 dark patterned rug ,  gray cat  and my little area rugs as well . 
my husband and i have tried them all over the years . 
a breeze to clean ,  the black bowl doesn t stain . 
this is more of a sweeper than a vacuum . 
this makes mashed potatoes so much more creamy and no lumps . 
i have a garden and had a great crop this year . 
the cap seals off well and no leaking . 
arrived within a week with free super saving shipping . 
i am delighted with the color and functionality . 
does what it s suppose to do ,  protect the screen . 
no way for the filter to pop out . 
however ,  the crust never got crispy enough for our liking . 
we found this tool to be nearly useless . 
 cook s illustrated  gave this one its highest rating . 
i have not used my regular oven even once since purchasing this . 
it washes beautifully and the finish is beautiful and shiny . 
it can be a great serving dish as well . 
otherwise ,  happy with it ,  great for french toast . 
the quality of the protector though is great !  . 
the vinyl is all clear with no cloth backing . 
they are easy to clean and a must have for any level baker . 
perfect weight ,  love the silver and the ball is just right . 
i got this as an adjunct to my larger food processor . 
i bought this to cojplete a set of these scoops . 
i offered her this idea ,  and she loves it . 
very easy to change out the battery ,  too . 
this is a very handy device to have when i travel . 
easiest install and fix i have ever done on a num_extend phone . 
it is just that useful to have around . 
i had read the reviews on this and the hoover floormate . 
i used it the next down and drained it all the way down . 
it s also easy to clean and store in a plastic bag etc . 
i was concerned about the  pre seasoned  quality before i bought them . 
so when i received mine i tested them . 
these cable are awesome ,  they work great for my ipod touch . 
easy to clean and uses little storage space . 
the price is reasonable and the product quality is very good . 
will save counter space and this makes as good or better coffee . 
i will continue to use otterbox cases in the future . 
i purchased it for a guy and he loved it !  . 
the power button is easy to use with this case . 
i received the item yesterday and opened it right away . 
if you own a nesco dehydrator extra trays are a must . 
pressing the volume and the on off button are no problem whatsoever . 
no issues with glare at all ,  and they fit perfectly . 
this rolling pin makes it much easier to roll out crusts . 
the knives get a little tarnish on them . 
be carefull that eventually will pull the rubber and get it stretched . 
the beater brush setting can be on on or off . 
its a rubber case and its really good . 
they re also very easy to break down and clean . 
i prefer this headset to the one that came with my ipod . 
my husband did all the cooking for us until he died last year . 
it grinds quick and even . this one is for work . 
i used to have an otter box for my other phone . 
it cuts my canning time nearly in half . 
so i got a white one and it arrived in about num_num days . 
bottom line ,  this is an elegant leather case . 
i had made a sorbet and it was very hard frozen . 
these are not bad for the price at all . 
this hdmi cable worked like a charm on my bionic . 
these silpats are the perfect size for baking cookies in any counterttop oven . 
nice ,  nice !  love the lid with it too . 
i despise a greasy outdoor grill or smoker . 
it does take a while ,  but i think it is worth it . 
it is very useful for a good cooker . 
spread out over the year it is more than worth it . 
i m glad to have found it on amazon again . 
the other containers will hold things without sauces very well . 
never spills and always hot and wonderful flavor . 
this is the absolutely best turner i have purchased . 
this machine made life worth living again  :   okay . 
then you can adjust the tension on the line if you need to . 
dry erase markers easily wipe off ,  which is a problem to me . 
it works great ,  and i ve used it on business travel myself . 
this toaster works well ,  especially for english muffins and bagels . 
this one is perfect for small jar openings . 
it helps with cooking for the brood ,  and saves on dishes . 
they say this is a num_extend cup  rice cooker . 
but cook s illustrated reviewed meat grinders and rated this highly . 
 but ,  forget about those ridiculous helmet shaped lids !   . 
or play it safe and buy it from an apple store . 
i purchased this with num_num other norpro kitchen utensils . 
i always try to buy a num_num yr . 
this one is much tougher and it handles high temperatures quite well . 
not sure it makes any difference except i will not get updates . 
it was also very easy to clean up . 
keep the surface clean and be sure the top edge is lined up . 
the feature for warm and  bagel  function is neat . 
i have very good german grade knives and this sharpener is very nice . 
so much easier than using a fork or oversized potato masher . 
i decided to get a new one and replace it . 
i should know better than to go shopping around . 
also works well for grating garlic and small spices . 
love this knife ,  makes slicing my homemade bread so much easier . 
i had this product for over num_num years and it works fine . 
this is simply the best case money can buy . 
should have thought of that before i ordered . 
it still works just as well as the first time we used it . 
i ve had one of these for five years . 
slicing and wedging is easy and the clean up is even easier . 
i posted two my dinner photos ,  so you could take a look . 
other than that ,  cleanup is easy ,  i hand wash mine . 
well made and durable and the price is right . 
i saw mine at a store and then ordered on amazon :   . 
i have mine paired to num_num at this time and all is well . 
so i have to say i am happy with my purchase . 
glad i chose it over some others that were slightly cheaper . 
she says it made perfect toast with dial on num_extend
manufacturers love plastic because it is cheap and easy to form . 
it was never meant to be kept inside the oven . 
i usually put this on my cutting board when i cut veggies . 
the quality  and rust resistance  depends on the amounts of other elements used . 
i have always been terrified of pressure cookers . 
remove your pot from the heat at time . 
the skillets are hand made in france in a foundry at num_num degrees . 
it is sturdy and holds quite a bit . 
i ve brought these for my phone and for my ipod . 
you can use store bought yogurt or make your own . 
i like the drip plate and that it is also removable . 
the plastic lid may behave differently when left in the fridge . 
easy to put in ,  take out and very easy to clean . 
would buy this phone again if i needed another phone . 
especially ifyour meal was made on them in the oven . 
i replaced it with the slightly smallerwilton cake and cookie lifter . 
love that they maximize the water in your tub . 
cool that it comes with its own rack ,  too . 
nothing ever sticks and cleanup is a breeze . 
my only complain is this is on the small side . 
the clove smell is finally dissipating after washing after each use . 
they are very clear and don t interfere with the touch screen functionality . 
i have started from the coarsest setting and progressed to the finest . 
it is very well written and has all the maintenance and operating instructions . 
loved it gave to granddaughter for her first appartment . 
was very pleased with the case as well as the cost . 
i got this for my nexus num_num when traveling . 
flipping was a breeze with a wooden skewer . 
lots of protection for the phone especially in on the outside corners . 
for the money though ,  this is great grinder . 
the plug folds down for better portability and pivots num_extend
one can never have enough glass bowls in the kitchen . 
the handles make them very comfortable to use too . 
it charges my iphone much faster than using my computer s usb num_extend
i bought these and realized what a great value they really were . 
this is oem and not third party after market . 
three screws; you provide the philips screwdriver . easy to operate . 
the biggest problem with this item is the lack of a manual . 
it has a very powerful suction and it doesn t scratch our floors . 
i really like that the  ribs  are thick but widely spaced . 
i have been equally disappointed in what i ve found at other stores . 
the item arrive with good deliver and service . 
it cut smoothly leaving very little crust around . 
nice mug overall and i would recommend this to a friend !  . 
i was able to get relatively hard ice cream . 
i searched online and in stores for a cover for my new iphone . 
the battery costs well over half what a new one of these costs . 
anyways ,  this came in the mail very quickly . 
i got my steamer yesterday and it is awesome . 
she was very happy to have a spare one for her mixer . 
i thought it was suppose to be clear ,  but it is smoked . 
the handle is comfortable and does not tire my hand with heavy chopping . 
i picked up the phone num_num days ago . 
now i see amazon has come down in price . 
a crunching carrot is louder then the machine ,  its very quiet . 
my husband and i love this pizza oven . 
i see that amazon is not offering this product anymore . 
if you pull hard enough they will open up . 
and finally i can bake frozen battered cod with no sticking as well . 
i had this one when i first got married num_num years ago . 
just type it in and there you go . 
i have them myself and bought these as a gift . 
set up and take down is easy and cleaning is a snap . 
my family used moka espresso maker all the time . 
i love the finger grip for easy pouring without slipping . 
it seemed to be the ony thing that could withstand my abuse . 
i m so glad that i found these jars here in amazon . 
this holds true for the bodum double as well but not significantly . 
i have used the product several times and am definitely quite satisfied . 
i felt much better after the first night s sleep . 
the serrated knife is hard to use and does not cut meat smoothly . 
he likes to cook so this was perfect . 
this has really become an indispensable kitchen tool for me now . 
the pan heats evenly and does a great job . 
i think that may be because they used the dishwasher to clean them . 
not much you can say about measuring cups . 
this grinder is clearly well engineered and built . 
it comes with a cleaning brush that gets some of the reside out . 
this has been one of my favorite bluetooth  bt  headsets to date . 
just not for me ,  i m a put phone in jean type . 
my hands are very weak ,  so they are especially helpful to me . 
you can inherit this grill to your grandchildren . 
i actually don t even use grandma s anymore after buying this . 
if you own any tupperware ,  you will love this item . 
i love the hot pink of this cover . 
holds num_num quarts or can squeeze num_num pints in if you are careful . 
i bent the handle just dropping it in the floor . 
the enclosed skin fits over my iphone num_extend very well . 
i ve never had such an easy time making delicious salads . 
i love this item so much ,  i ve ordered num_extend
this is nice because it has a large quantity . 
this is a great case for the money . 
i used a small drill and made a small hole with my hand . 
did not fall apart on me ,  seems reasonably put together . 
this thing must be num_num years old now and still like new . 
the pan is very well made and sturdy . 
the fiesta ware is very strong and doesn t scratch or chip easily . 
again ,  i have used it for over num_num years . 
recomend all pie makers tom get this item . great product . 
but for the money .  .  . it is a great buy . 
then i lost it for a while and was surprisingly upset . 
the metal wires instead of the silicone just works better . 
these pans are simply perfect for use with num_num oz . 
this set is built well feels sturdy and i have had no problems . 
i can confirm the product i received appears to be just that . 
if you like everything completely spotless ,  this may annoy you . 
these are nice and we use them now . 
take note that these come in different sizes depending on type of loaf . 
charging is no longer than charging my phone alone . 
the firmware update does help a lot with the battery not lasting . 
this air popper makes very good popcorn ,  but it s quite messy . 
i hope others enjoy it as much as i am hoping to . 
fortunately ,  this backup battery more than doubles my power capacity . 
they last about num_num years and then we have to replace them . 
i still would recommend even though there is a size problem . 
the problems i have had when using it is all the adjustments . 
so ,  i ended up pairing this to my work blackberry instead . 
i will always use them when i can . 
the adhesive is very strong for how little you use . 
easy to swap out the old one with the new . 
bought this after i purchased an iphone num_num and broke the screen . 
i like the oxo small scoop the best . 
the steam does loosen dirt well ,  without chemicals . 
all i do is run hot water over it and it comes clean . 
the colors are ok but the price was great . 
i couldn t imagine anyone dividing that into num_num cups . 
it s loud which is necessary when you re driving . 
you will love it and you can t beat the price . 
this makes the best popcorn in the world . 
this thermos is super nice compared to the other brand thermos s . 
i purchased this and it was everything that i expected . 
i would recommend this since i have had good luck with it . 
i sometimes use the single racks for bread ,  etc . 
if you re ready for an upgrade ,  this is your machine . 
audio quality is pretty good since i m streaming . 
its actually still unbroken after almost a year or so of owning . 
you have to do so every time you use it . 
wrapped and ribboned i think that would make an attractive gift . 
the clip prevents too much pull on the belt loops . recommended . 
my num_num stars reflect the quality of the japanese made ones . 
i bought this case for my ipod touch . 
this product also seems to work well to reduce glare . 
i can see through it and see the amounts i have left . 
other than that ,  this has far exceeded my expectations !  . 
i m not sure if they are charging all the way . 
he tweaked a few settings and i think it helped . 
it arrived quickly and was very protectively packaged . 
its a heavy glass measuring num_num quart measuring cup . 
i bought this so i can start making kombucha in it . 
it includes a silicone  scrapper  attached to one side of the beater blade . 
they are tight and flush with the outside . 
these are a great time saver for round cake pans . 
this thing has all of the features and settings you will need . 
i then went through setting up a secure connection . 
i buy three or four packages at a time . 
best phone case i ever had !  not bulky at all . 
didn t realize they were coming from hong kong . 
i used organic milk and organic horizon s plain yogurt as a starter . 
also rubber anti skids are a nice touch . 
i have the iphone num_extend and this is for the iphone num_extend
and it was a perfect size for me . 
but ,  i wouldn t use a stand mixer as a juicer anyway . 
after a price check ,  i decided to purchase the full set . 
i will be buying more with my next amazon . com order . 
filters are generally expensive anyway for air purifiers . 
would be nice if it had an  ultra low  setting . 
based on this i know it will easily recharge my iphone multiple times . 
this is the second cuisinart food processor i have owned . 
doesn t break down when washing them a few times . 
these beautiful pans are professional grade and always bake evenly and clean easily . 
i remembered the almost never ending variety of carbonated drinks they made . 
it protects my phone ,  and it s easy to find . 
the replaceable blade is the same for both models ,  another plus . 
these bags work perfectly for my old hoover vacuum . 
there really isn t much to say about a case for a phone . 
this set was nice for an everyday set of dishes . 
too bad the usb cable doesn t also charge the battery . 
i even saved $ by purchasing a used but in new condition one . 
this is actually a set of num_num hangers for an amazing price . 
some of the base is lost ,  resulting in a slightly tinnier sound . 
i gave it four stars because of the insert problem i mentioned earlier . 
i got it as a gift to myself for xmas . 
the app  podcasting  is missing for some reason . 
it s a nice product and seems to work just fine . 
they offer various sizes to suit your needs . 
timer works and looks great !  i bought it on amazon . com . 
a bit more agressive than the regular mixing blade . 
we bought it with the keurig and are drinking coffee like mad now . 
would be nice if akro included a few labels for the front . 
i only wish there was a way to disable the led . 
the more i use it the more i like num_extend
worked extremely well on all and the unit is extremely easy to use . 
it is gorgeous and looks of high quality . 
i would recommend if you need a replacement . 
otherwise are a good deal and work well . 
thick aluminum will provide even heat for baking . 
both were close in temp so pretty accurate . 
when i bake things seem to cool faster . 
 i never thought to do that with my other units . 
having an extra bowl  or two  is a good thing . 
transfer them to a wire rack ,  as soon as possible . 
will not drain of excess fat like some grills . 
set the alarm and slide it in and automatically goes into docking mode . 
this little stand does the job and it cost under num_num bucks !  . 
normally they would be very hard to peel and i would butcher them . 
when i have motorola on ,  i imagine i m knight rider . 
i loved this while i had my droid x . 
also nice when you want to take a chilled bottle with you outside . 
bravo anker i will continue to buy any product with an anker logo . 
once paired ,  i took it for a test run . 
i was forever getting more than i wanted . 
i like the fact that they are very durable and reliable . 
but it still cracked so i might have to switch to another brand . 
the assembly plant is located in greenville ,  ohio . 
it seems that often the pictures on amazon do not match the product . 
i am impressed with how fast this item arrived in the mail . 
now to get the rest of my cabinets this organized !  . 
great for all those small things that need to be hang dried . 
love the look and definitely a neat buy . 
these are the perfect weight and size for every day use . 
it seems thicker and the shape is a tad different but works perfectly . 
the is a great splash guard and pouring shield . 
the price of this fiesta casserole had me pause before i purchased it . 
they are genuine samsung and they feel like the quality you d expect . 
i used this vacuum to replace my num_num amp dirt devil power stick . 
puts a wonderful amount of air in what you whisk . 
i love the case ,  very soft and protective . 
my phone fits well even with a thin protective case . 
this product true in color fits phone perfect . 
since i have used it for so long here are my final conclusions . 
heats num_num cups of water fast !  was well worth the price . 
this is a heavy and solid garlic press . 
i have tried other brands but its oenophilia for me . 
received mount and immediately attached it to the windshield . 
no longer can they peek over and watch what you are watching . 
the insulated pot keeps your coffee warm without burning your coffee . 
i ve used both several times already and they both work great . 
i was happy to receive these kitchen shears for christmas . 
all of the pieces are extremely high quality ,  thick and completely nonstick . 
the slider mechanism feels solid and has a good snap to it . 
my phone automatically connects when i switch the headset on and vice versa . 
this is a great coffeemaker for the price . 
this is truly a product that makes food preparation easy . 
these are great i had num_num but needed num_num more . 
i needed something bigger ,  faster ,  stronger . enter jabra sport headset . 
exactly the one you see in the store . 
it is sturdy and well made without being too heavy . 
i loke the fact that it actually attaches to the phone . 
the machine ,  looks a bit like a shop vac . 
they seem to work fine and install easy . 
this made me lower my rating to num_num stars . 
i would think white and red might be other good color options .   . 
i will replace it but ovrrall ,  i absolutely love them . 
this battery has brought new life to my evo num_extend
i love the fact that this kettle has a whistle sound . 
this battery is great for replacing my original battery which was going bad . 
another design flaw that didn t have to be . 
it attaches nicely to the side of my purse using the sturdy clip . 
would drop my phone and it would be just fine . 
this makes the smoothest mashed potatoes ,  sweet potatoes ,  squash ever . 
i m totally satisfied and would highly recommend this product . 
it works great and the gages are very easy to read . 
i had a lot of problems with the case design flaking away . 
the video camera is very low resolution ,  with high compression . 
for me ,  i don t see a problem in this area . 
thank you so much for reading my review !  . 
the pocket on the outside is a nice way to store accessories too . 
we love this pasta fork it works great and have had no issues . 
i charged both at the same time and it worked flawless . 
i bought this unit after having a mr . 
my only complaint has to do with the power button . 
i bought it in a local gourmet shop . 
i dulled it by being dumb and cutting something on a ceramic plate . 
box that it came in looked really nice . 
i have a num_num piece place setting of this product . 
i love the glass collection jar because there s no static clingy mess . 
this one fit the bill and i have not regretted it . 
so far ,  it is exactly what i wanted . 
the case is great ,  and the phone is fine . 
i had lived with nasal congestion and draining when i awoke for years . 
plus ,  it s way better than buying extra multimedia docks !  . 
i am thankful that we both like our coffee bold and black . 
the canisters are very beautiful resting on the counter top . 
took a few weeks to get as it ships from asia . 
there are a number of things to like about this product . 
it s big and feels heavy in the hands . 
the ring that opens the filling hole turns way ,  way too easily . 
cleans thoroughly so no oily residue on the plastic . 
it grinds the beans in seconds and is easy to clean . 
the set also includes a connector for apple devices  proprietary ports . 
i like to add four drops of liquid stevia . 
fantastic look ,  very useful for picking up small pots and pans . 
i have no complaints at all with this product . 
my second home is in the mountains and it is very dry . 
i expect this press to last a long time . 
i purchased this to replace the last one . 
i literally have like all of their kitchen tools . 
if you need more freezing time ,  you can just keep on going . 
i use them mostly for cookies and meatballs . 
seals break right when they should ,  liquids are aerated perfectly . 
i would say % come out decent ,  not perfect . 
yes ,  yes ,  i know android doesn t offer as many apps . 
this cutting board was offered free along with a santoku knife . 
this pan would be a bargain at twice the price . 
i now enjoy more things in my salad like beets and tomatoes . 
after paying to have my carpet steamed cleaned ,  i bought this one . 
filters are easy to remove and replace for cleaning . 
it is simple to use ,  with complete instructions and recipes . 
i m in love with the bialetti moka express . 
it was a speedy shipping and the cases lastest for quite awhile . 
this is my favorite bread machine so far . 
they seem to work great on my older phones  android num_extend or num_extend
with rice it s a matter of common sense . 
this is one of the best things i own in the kitchen . 
the only negative is the disposal of the grounds afterward . 
be sure to get it to snap down on all sides . 
as far as glass basters go ,  it s a pretty decent one . 
had to remove shims for machine to operate again . 
i always trust otterbox with my cell phone protection . 
it will make cooking an even more joyous experience . 
i love this whisk .  .  . i bought it for folding ingredients . 
preheat the waffle iron between num_num and num_extend
just like the one you get from verizon . 
looks and feels just like the original battery i got for my tmobile num_extend
yes ,  some key apps are missing ,  but the catalog is growing . 
this is counterproductive since my fingers are not so very precise . 
this includes the top portion of the phone over the speakers . 
further ,  sound quality is great and the noise reduction is excellent . 
i wish there was a way to make the slices adjustable . 
it is just the right size to get dirt and fur from corners . 
just get the color you like and click order . 
weighted at the bottom so they won t tip over . 
this little pot is the latest addition and it certainly hasn t disappointed . 
i recommend it for any kitchen ,  not just to canners !  . 
none of the phones were able to make a call . 
it reminds me of something you d find in a professional kitchen . 
great case and great fit it just wasn t my style . 
the build quality is good and doesn t feel cheap . 
and willing to forgive the small crack as long as it stays small . 
i can understand with everyday use they would wear down quicker . 
only time will tell though but i have complete faith . 
even my old unit says  made in china  . it is very loud . 
this came as recommendation from cooksillustrated and i could not be happier . 
i love this pan it is the perfect size and cooks evenly . 
light weight ,  acceptable sound quality ,  and easy setup . 
i like this device better than my jabra clipper . 
it fits the phone perfect ,  and super easy to put on . 
i mean ,  it charges my phone and ipod same time . 
everything but the handle can go into the dishwasher . 
under normal use i m sure it would last a very long time . 
all the cut out for the camera ,  flash etc . 
this basic model is fine for weekly use in my household . 
it s easy to handle ,  light weight and is dishwasher safe . 
deliberate mating of battery to charger required to prolong life of product . 
the person on the other end said it was good too . 
be ready for this to be a heavy tool . 
this cover looks super pretty on my iphone !  i love it . 
i like the case and would recommend it . 
preheated first then sprayed with evo before dropping the spoonfuls . 
on the others ,  the area around the hinge tore out . 
i can t honestly say if this pot is good for canning . 
lid is a good fit and rests with gravity . 
it is longer than what is given with the phone . 
it is noisy but gets good airflow and moves the kernels around well . 
filter should have been attached to motor end instead . 
he s way clumsy like me ,  so this made a perfect fit . 
none of them had suffered damage during shipping . 
it makes the best coffee i ve ever had at home . 
my son gave me these for mother s day . 
is easy to clean and easy to use . 
if you like quiesadillas then you will love this item . 
it takes like num_num mins to charge too . 
this is a great product for a great price !  . 
it is light in weight ,  easily cleaned ,  and comfortable . 
and ,  the size of the cup is perfect for filling most bowls . 
this num_extend is the best little charger that i have seen . 
i tried a couple other brands that only partly worked . 
i made the classic mistake of not reading the description . 
you just have to hold the jar sealer firmly on the jar . 
they are easy to wash and easy to store !  . 
i was intrigued by the positive reviews and price . 
save yourself the $ and buy the protectors from here . 
but i love italian food and that will be my next project . 
these work great on lodge skillets ,  the provide protection and maximum grip . 
their cheap enough that you can give them away as a gift . 
i own tons of external batteries for my apple devices . 
as a date was not listed when i purchased it . 
this is a great thermometer for both and less expernsive than others . 
reliable for charging via computer or wall outlet . 
after one round of pepperoni ,  it paid for itself . 
none of my devices got hot after charging . 
this thing is a beast when it comes to capacity . 
it is still on the phone no peeling up like some other ones . 
my old coffee maker was just too big for me . 
so far ,  i know i am very satisfied with my choice . 
i love the little rollerbrush attachment ,  never seen one like it . 
it looks great on my counter and provides very handy use of utensils . 
the pan has been easy to rinse off and wipe clean . 
i have less expensive fiskars ,  garden shears ,  box knives ,  etc . 
i have tried to bend it to fit perfectly but have been unsuccessful . 
this is as simple and reliable and functional as it gets . 
the unu dx plus more than doubles thebattery for your iphone . 
i purchased this grinder based on prior reviews here on amazon . 
the lid is nice and does not leak . 
the extra couple hundred mah over stock are nice . 
the price is good and the motor is powerful . 
any clogging would be attributable to the grinds itself . 
for the price ,  you get a lot for your money . 
it s the perfect size for a small dinner or party . 
i like a thin ,  crispy crust and it was perfect . 
this set of pans is a great value . 
this is the second taylor thermometer i have owned . 
then i found out my sister already bought her one fml . 
this is  made in china   quality control ,  i guess . 
i really haven t had anything new in years . 
my wife had one of these tervis tumblers before and really liked it . 
it s just what i expected perfect size and looks nice . 
i thought i honestly would but thats not the case . 
fiesta has been our goto dish ware for the last few years . 
it is so quick and easy to use . 
it s like a jelly one that stretches over the phone . 
works great !  needed a replacement for my old charger . 
since i never used it i won t miss it . 
of course ,  being half asleep in the morning may account for that . 
great leather case and a great protector for the cell phone . 
peeling ,  coring and slicing apples is a long tedious process . 
no worries though because synching this headset couldn t have been easier . 
just soak the lid in cool water for num_num min . 
obviously for their num_num gajillion models they have out in the world . 
they are nice and thick and very reasonably priced in my opinion . 
no other brand even comes close to the power of the cuisinart . 
my parents have used one of these since the num_extend
getting a fingernail under the back part really helps pop it into place . 
i can t get enough of stainless steel kitchen tools . 
i came across this calculator while in culinary school a few years back . 
i like to mix and match the colors . 
my husband loves this ,  now he makes breakfast and does the dishes . 
this is a pretty good phone for the money and to only be num_extend
i have used the presto for over a week now . 
every bt unit i ve used has a wonky relationship with the iphone . 
made a very convenient way to double my phone s life . 
these had favorable reviews wanted to give them a shot . 
you can even set for thinner cookies or thicker ones . 
voice dialing is simple and can even be done with mild background noise . 
how can you go wrong with a kettle that does its job ?  . 
once the dough gets thinner ,  it works better . 
i use the bowls for the same when there is cause for more . 
i m glad i didn t buy the num_extend a month ago . 
that is ,  they can accommodate a very wide belt . 
a perfect gift for any and all at christmas . 
you learned things on page num_num that you needed to know on page num_extend
with a half turn to the adjuster the problem was solved . 
hold it as lightly as you can while still applying unscrewing pressure . 
then i ordered the zagg num_extend back up battery system . 
but i go right back to the bose . 
this organizer works well for my silverware drawer . 
this press makes a terrific pot of tea . 
wouldn t use it if it didn t work for me . 
cause if you are ,  i want to marry you . 
this package of usb ipod cords is a great idea . 
this is still the best press out there . 
i order one and was pleased with the apparently quality of the construction . 
the pan developed a small blister on the bottom . 
it won t be tipping over any time soon . 
it allows you to hear voice texts and post to twitter and facebook . 
the quiches can now be thicker and bigger . 
at their current price ,  they are a very good value . 
to have a spoon rest and a lid rest in one is great . 
i use this with my nuwave cook top . 
verizon wanted to charge me like $ for covers . 
this is a very nice canner worth the money paid for it . 
only drawback is it s tough to stow when not in use . 
overall ,  just a great set of knives from a great maker .

this kit includes everything you could want to decently decorate a cake . 
it will probably be peeling vegetables just as well in another num_num years . 
i will update immediately if it does break or lose functionality . 
my only complaint is that it doesn t have a lid !  . 
these capresso grinders are far superior to others i have tried .

it charged my phone and ipad in record time . 
i drop this phone every time i fall asleep reading on it . 
i purchased this item from amazon about four years ago . 
i had the hardest time finding a toaster with long slots . 
no recipe just picked out some veggies i wanted . 
and i have more than my fair share of  non stick  cookware . 
nice product but very finicky to put on . 
so that one too lasted about four years . 
i have to say they are much better than the num_extend

one thing however is that this fan scares my cats . 
had to turn the phone off and then back on yesterday . 
my carpet looks like it was just installed . 
fits like a glove and offers a lot of protection too . 
hope this brew and go lasts me a long time . 
the one big negative was the standard battery . 
the key is in mixing up the dough . 
it s solid feeling and seems to be nicely constructed . 
lights will go out as you deplete the battery pack charging your device .

i love this machine and i use it nearly every day . 
it was definitely a lot quicker then mopping and a lot cleaner . 
i then washed the pot ,  and then put in drainer to dry . 
i like it but i don t think it does anything special . 
the bonus here is that it comes apart to make cleaning simple . 
this is a beautifull phone ,  but this have a little internal memory . 
they clean up easy and when they latch ,  they seem pretty airtight . 
i would definately recommend them to a friend or anyone .

i ve used this cutting board almost every day for two years . 
it offers good protection for bumps and nicks . 
i think some one took it from his . 
but all of the screen protectors out there are like that . 
we use it for shaving parmesan and romano cheese for our pasta dishes . 
i am really surprised at all the negative responses . 
i will never use another kind of case again .

that said ,  the num_extend is pretty comfortable to wear .

i got this to baste my turkey for thanksgiving . 
this is a great product if the screen of your iphone is unprotected . 
this is how easy it is to use the plantronics  . audio num_extend
con :  too short; not long enough for num_extend
the only difference between the expensive and the cheap protector is the thickness . 
this splitter does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
for perfect cornbread ,  nothing cooks as well as cast iron . 
perfect size for a shirt pocket or for portability while traveling . 
bought these just incase i messed the original parts out . 
quick shipment ,  works great ,  and would buy again . 
i don t understand why this pan is not marketed more . 
only get henckels that have two men on the blade ,  not one . 
and i have to say it makes the best coffee since the braun . 
and the delivery time was rather good as well . 
and they are far superior than anything you can buy at walmart . 
they clean up so easily in the dishwasher too . 
as per the title my only concern the thickness of the glass walls . 
i really liked the design of this specific one and the colors . 
came pretty quick ,  looks and works as advertised . 
it is easy to clean ,  though hand washing is best . 
this is the best waffle maker i have ever owned . 
i have had this product for over a year . 
it was not irritating or heavy or anything . 
i use one on my cat s drinking fountain . 
it s actually not easy to get things in and out . 
i already have many calphalon pots and pans . 
i need something that could grind things to a fine powder . 
but still overall the best i have used . 
i normally use the external battery packs to charge my nexus devices . 
overall ,  i think this was a good purchase . 
can t ask for more than num_num years service . 
he said i would need rivets and a rivet gun . 
amazon has top pricing on this product too . 
you cam measure or just keep yourself from sneezing . 
and less and less ground coffee was coming out into the bin . 
the cups get wedged on and don t come off . 
this is really sharp ,  so please keep away from children . 
it also holds on to the top when the removal is done . 
this is a nice case that protects well ,  without being too bulky . 
no matter ,  i use these at the gym or in the car . 
the paper is heavier ,  thicker ,  more dense the  normal  paper filters . 
the can opener works as good today as the first day it arrived . 
i used to take paper towels cover a strainer and drain plain yogurt . 
strange to get excited by glass bowls ,  but i have . 
for those that like stats ,  i have posted some num_extend
love them both !  great present for your baker friends . 
good looking design ,  but why the key ring on handle ?  . 
great for drinks ,  but also especially for cooking . 
this is just right for binding meat and other kitchen uses . 
literally not much bigger than specks of dust . 
when a call comes in ,  it switches automatically . 
they come out immediately and easily with no trouble . 
i was a police officer and this case seen some rough times . 
love the colors and the rubber feel of it . 
the seller was prompt with shipping and the transaction was very smooth . 
i think its a great value for money . 
i don t need a case while the phone is docked anyway . 
my husband uses it every day and is extremely happy . 
i still use the damaged pan for making pasta . 
the product is heavy and solid ,  very substantial . 
the battery is advertised to last a long time and it does . 
they go through cardstock and can still hold up a card or picture . 
well ,  it broke recently and was lost without it . 
the pegs screw on separately to the top piece . 
no way this should cost over num_num bucks . 
it s a very good quality ,  heavy duty cake pan . 
i ll see how that works when the time comes . 
you just have to consider your priorities when choosing a french press . 
fits perfectly ,  have no problems taking it on and off . 
in it and have been very happy with it s performance . 
the fit was perfect on the num_extend i mean like precision build . 
a good camping panel ,  also a good  beginner  panel as well . 
i made round eggs with a cube of spam in the middle . 
no glitches ,  and no feeling of worry of glitches either . 
i think it would still work today if i was the only user . 
this is a great second bowl for a kitchen aid stand mixer set . 
i bought this for my daughter and she loves it . 
it s great for turning softer items such as eggs . 
useful battery if you need power more than portability for your mobile . 
i am very pleased with the quality of this product . 
i was very surprised how much cabinet space they freed up . 
just wish it came with a key ring attached !  perfect christmas gifts . 
the matt finish is great because it doesn t collect finger prints . 
i saw tv celebs using tongs and decided to try them . 
it is light and protects it from the everyday wear and tear . 
we had a presto hot air popper for years and loved it . 
i purchased it to replace a wisk i accidentally melted . 
i used this for processing my deer this past winter . 
i works well ,  with the exception that it is flexible . 
upgrading to num_num stars ,  but still no info on long term durability . 
they do not have the silicone seals in the . 
took me a few minutes to figure out how to open it up . 
plenty of room for a couple loaves of nice bread and some misc . 
i then just used it according to directions . 
they are pretty strong but not enough to cool a pie . 
they responded and explained the situation so that was great . 
it sticks to your pocket as you slide it in and out . 
i spiked my phone at the ground and my phone was fine . 
i like it because it provides better  stickiness  than the bionic s case . 
this is my second hamilton beach meal maker express . 
it cleans off easily and feels smooth  satin  to the touch . 
i like the rubber stabilizers on the outside . 
these are great to use for your cooking and baking . 
the downside is it doesn t have a place to charge it . 
it is made well and is easy to use . 
it takes me only num_num minutes to put together by myself . 
true to the description ,  it fits whole apples and is frighteningly powerful . 
it looks better made than proctor silex ,  hamilton beach products . 
this is one of those inexpensive products that exceeds expectations . 
gives me a heads up when they are done . 
with preground meat that is even more of a concern . 
i don t heat the oven above num_num deg . 
however ,  the panasonic does not work with adapters for the iphone . 
this size also makes a wonderful deep dish pizza pan . 
it never scratched or peeled ,  i would buy more . 
even with mild use ,  you ll be charging it every night . 
at this point the whole system is very inexpensive . 
just be sure to measure carefully ,  as it says in the book . 
so i would recommend this phone to anyone thinking of picking this up . 
i bought this case directly from otterbox  they had a cyber monday deal  . 
it stays really clean and so far has not scratched . 
the air return is at the top and dispersed quickly throughout the num_extend
the less salt versions have had potassium chloride which leave an aftertaste . 
i was hesitant about which one of these trays to try . 
i use a little olive oil ,  so the seasonings stick . 
it is sturdy and hold lots of things in my garage . 
i thought this was a good buy for the money i paid . 
but gave them some time in my phone and they charged right up . 
i ordered this for my daughters girl friend . 
it had to be cleaned and with cleaning ,  it could be salvaged . 
i am very happy with both the seller and the product . 
so i we had to get another one . 
i am a long time user of kitchen aid stand mixers . 
there s little rubberish bottoms to keep it from sliding around the counter . 
the current rom i have for it is something called cyanmobile experience . 
the way these look with my bookshelf speaker are awesome . 
i go through head phones like one pair every three months or so . 
these are study and colorful and are fun to use . 
it also takes up minimal counter space and looks nice . 
this was a shower gift for my grand niece . 
decided to go with a usb microphone and bypass the mic jack . 
it is easy to use and vacuums very well . 
you d be happy knowing your device is protected during a fall . 
after so many electric kettle purchases ,  i found one i really like . 
prior to now my favorites were the plantronics num_num and num_extend
same great product ,  glad they are out there . 
i recommend to keep your droid looking new . 
it was built well not cheap like the knockoff brands . 
it s just the size needed and does what i need to do . 
yes ,  i would gladly recommend olde thompson stainless to others . 
my one complaint is that the bowl is on the small side . 
i purchased these about num_num weeks ago for use at work . 
i wish i would have bought this thing a long time ago . 
this set is very nice it has quite a few sizes in it . 
i am satisfied so far and cannot complain . 
it was !  !  works great without the otterbox on it . 
i can take it from home to car with ease . 
now i can make my own version of capaccuni at home . 
to clean it ,  you just rinse with hot water ,  no soap . 
it looks like the stand is more sturdy . 
samsung replaces these with their own with mixed results . 
blade grinders are just fine for drip coffees . 
if i use the stone my knives don t get sharpened . 
however ,  the color keeps bleeding into my cupcake tin . 
worth every penny if you can wait for the shipment from china . 
plastic cover ensures no cuts when pulling the zester from the utensils drawer . 
things cut really nicely on it ,  and it cleans up beautifully . 
yes ,  i know ,  you can get tongs anywhere . 
it s a simple product that fulfills its function perfectly . 
now this is only a theory on my part . 
this is one cup that you can leave on your counter . 
does not cover the entire screen but does cover most of it . 
they help wrangle the bags of frozen veggies and such . 
so is the locking tab that keeps them closed for storage . 
it comes with three earbud sizes and three earloop sizes . 
out of the box there was a hairline crack . 
this was a gift ,  so i have not used it personally . 
you should note that connection could be use for not just apple . 
when i first saw photos of it ,  i thought it was hideous . 
this worked great right out of the box . 
i bought my first one over five years ago . 
this is same like original headphones ,  probably it is real oem . 
i bought this battery and received it quick . 
one piece construction ,  good weight ,  sharp as hell . 
the convection feature makes fast work of casseroles and deep dish items . 
works perfectly with the alarm clock feature on this phone . 
i used this pan to sear filet mignon at very high heat . 
with the original charger it would take about half that time for me . 
you get what you pay for ,  and that s the truth . 
i love the flexibility of the different settings . 
there are other devices that can handle num_extend amp devices ordual charging . 
this cooker has really come in handy with my family gatherings . 
it has a great suction ,  it even cleans your baseboards . 
overall a great protector and worth the money . 
it comes with an adapter that plugs into your computer s usb port . 
worth buying if you still have iphone num_extend
it also make for a good hands free mount . 
i ve had them for about num_num months now ,  and no breakages . 
others didn t stay on ,  fell out ,  and were easily lost . 
a lot less clean up than using a skillet . 
i spent a while looking elsewhere for this . 
these knives have a strong construction and comfortable handle . 
wmf puts out some very high quality items . 
strong cord ,  works as it should ,  but a little too short . 
i have this and another ,  larger ,  bissell vacuum . 
been using this protector for a few weeks . 
mesh keeps loose tea in the filter and out of the pot well . 
i ordered him this handy little devil and it works great !  . 
i will definitely purchase more of these as my scobies multiply !  . 
i am constantly replacing chargers because they break are lost or stolen . 
nothing was any good !  so i m thrilled with my purchase . 
i went to a store and the cheapest was num_num bucks . 
this frother is a must for the serious coffee drinker . dec . 
this is the second time i order this product . 
we love these oxo spatulas ,  especially this size . 
i live alone and do not cook for alot of people . 
the suction cups are of good quality and have held very well . 
the steamer makes laundry day so much easier . 
i love this design and the ease of use . 
when i buy anything over $ i research . 
the call quality seems to be very good . 
they re all true . i use the chopper all the time . 
granted ,  my previous coffee makers have been gevali cheapees . 
requiring two hands to get the thing going makes it an interesting num_extend
the sound for both my music and pardora radio is incredible . 
i m a techie ,  though not an actual iphone technician by trade . 
this allows you to see how much clean water is left . 
shipped faster than expected and worked the first time i turned it on . 
also great for grating hard cheeses such as parmesan to grinding fresh nutmeg . 
cast iron does indeed live up to the hype . 
i don t have a problem pulling out the kickstand . 
my cake slid right out of the pan after cooling . 
as soon as people saw these on my phone they all wanted one . 
ordered this and within a week it was at the house . 
one bowl holds one popper from the whirly pop . 
this engraving ensures that the sizes won t wash away after repeated washings . 
the last model we had ,  had the hose connected . 
with the right coffee ,  it beats most coffee shop espressos hands down . 
they didnt seem to slip around in the product box . 
i have ordered num_num of these chargers for my iphone num_extend
it frees up my time to do something more fun . 
it produced a great waffle ,  but then i read the nutrition label . 
the noise cancellation alone i found doubly amazing . 
when a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready . 
it arrived fairly fast ,  brand new sealed in the package . 
having a good quality cutting board made of wood will take some care . 
i just don t think the original seasoning process was done correctly . 
so get that toothbrush out to make sure and keep it clean . 
you should not have quality knives in your home . 
these are larger than i thought they would be . 
the whole thing is programable and the coffee taste great . 
while not bullet proof ,  hard to beat for the price . 
i like to leave my phone standing on my desk . 
i gravitate toward these plates over regular every time i microwave . 
the price was her main reaso for placing the order . 
their pans are very heavyweight and will last forever . 
i have owned many different brands of bluetooth headsets . 
i got this coffee maker as a birthday gift two years ago . 
i just wished i had not wasted my money in $ cases !  . 
fortunately it has grip texture on the sides . 
i bought this item to store my tights and leggings . 
highly recommended for the simplicity of this device . 
do not expose to heat above num_num degrees f . 
bought this for my daughter and her family of num_extend
use them rough side down to hold better . 
this food processor is extremely well designed and well constructed . 
iphone ,  ipad ,  computer  so you can move around freely . 
and yes ,  dusts do not stick to this cover . 
this is the best pepper mill i have ever seen . 
i purchased this one and it makes great coffee just like i remember . 
the best thing that happened to me in a long time . 
this does both and still fits in the dishwasher . 
i like you can place them in the dishwasher . 
like the ones i already own ,  this one is super !  . 
installed in seconds and has been in place ever since . 
it is light to carry around ,  and it is very durable . 
i don t know how people say its not a great machine . 
fits perfect on the iron cast skillet i bought from lodge . 
i placed mine under the kitchen sink to store cleaning items . 
just wish they were not so stingy with the vacume bags . 
but i don t want to be doing it overly much . 
there has been no cracked pieces of plastic or anything like that . 
the product ,  as with most wilton products ,  was easy to clean . 
it is also a great size for making cornbread . 
they are one reason i chose this skillet . 
by the second run ,  i could keep it right at num_num lbs . 
like other oxo stainless steel spatulas ,  this one is excellent . 
but this product works exactly as its supposed to . 
we have a family of num_num and it holds plenty for us . 
my coffee tastes exceptional ,  and flavored coffee is really good . 
i froze the tub in my deep freezer for num_num num_extend
the pieces do not feel as sturdy ,  though they do the job . 
you can bend it if not careful with it in the sink . 
if you like a coarser grate ,  use a traditional grater . 
from other sites  if you give it permission  . 
the box didn t even say it was a permanent hepa filter . 
nicely made ,  nice price ,  should last for years to come . 
though the lining is made of plastic ,  not stainless . 
i bought this little popcorn popper a few years ago . 
you cannot go wrong with this cookware i promise you . 
aside from that though ,  great product !  clean up is very easy . 
creates a good pack for our espresso machine !  . 
the atrix will find the media and play the media . 
the only part that was a little finicky was adjusting the volume . 
they are perfectly weighted and they just feel good . 
who knows how many other devices it would have charged . 
although a little larger than i expected ,  well worth the money . 
not sure why i was buying those otterbox defender cases . 
a proper belgian frite ,  or  french fry  ,  is never frozen . 
after researching ,  i decided to try the zojirushi mr . 
thanks to the good amazon customers i found the solution to my problem . 
i plan to reorder as soon as i can . 
i ll probably order another one ,  just in case . 
two things about this make this a really by design . 
i ve had this over num_num years now and it works well . 
i would not use the containers for food storage without them . 
this set is a great companion purchase to the basic metrokane stopper . 
i had the original model for over num_num years when it broke . 
it looks good setting on the counter top by the stove . 
well ,  until now it still working and holding power for num_num hrs . 
the scratches i mentioned below are nothing to be concerned about . 
i had been using a wood hoop for my cross stitch projects . 
i have nothing to say bad about this . 
the new shape is even better than the older shape . 
then i may not have had to find a repairman on a weekend . 
i bought this for my iphone num_extend and my moms iphone num_extend
the filter is a bit pricy ,  but definitely does the job well . 
i have owned many different bread machines ,  and still do . 
this product is a must for anyone in a low humidity climate . 
my original headphones that came with my phone started fraying . 
the results are very tasty with fewer calories than popcorn cooked in oil . 
then i moved overseas and had wood floors . 
$ for a new carafe vs $ for a whole new coffee maker . 
it also works great in removing other odor such as pet . 
i use the accusharp sharpening tool when needed . 
i was happy i could pop it without oil though . 
i was a previous blackberry user and was accustomed to using holsters . 
i generally keep it on the  low  speed so that i can sleep . 
they were super easy to install and they are so functional . 
it looks great ,  the silicone case looks very thick and protective . 
i purchased num_num of these usb htc cords and all three worked . 
this is a super healthy snack and soooo quick to make !  . 
it shipped fast and it was what i wanted . 
it linked up with my iphone num_extend very quickly and sounds very good . 
this oven is the miracle of the century . 
my first recipe was with dried beans  black ,  pinto  for chili . 
that s saying a lot since i use it several times a day . 
all things considered i highly recommend this indoor grill . 
while this lid rack works well it is very to bend . 
he loves it ,  and it does work extremely well . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
she poured out hot water from it into a cup . 
overall these are very sharp and cut through my steak like butter . 
i just take a damp sponge or a mr . 
i have tried all my various knives to cut hard cheeses without success . 
i have not had any dead usb ports . 
it can go from the wall to your computer . 
each piece of good quality and makes me want to start cooking already . 
usb cable with htc tag on it ,  is included . 
narrowed top prevents splashing of milk during steaming . 
this works very well and makes baking a breeze . 
this frother has made it all so easy . 
it is a perfect complement to our lifestyle . 
get it now for your kitchen or living room . 
i have purchased several of these and i love them . 
with that high reliability i could not switch to another brand . 
it did a great job on a salmon fillet at setting three . 
oxo products are usually great and this one does the job !  . 
so far this bag has worked out very well . 
i don t feel the need to restate what has already been said . 
buy only the minutes you need each month . 
i keep all of my attachments including the pour shield inside the mixer . 
when first used ,  the default setting is num_num minutes . 
ha ! but the greatest thing about it is the food . 
i love the nonstick surface and the metal insert . 
i read the reviews but still went ahead and ordered . 
i decided on it after reading many favorable reviews . 
the case provides a very goog grip ,  even when in jeans . 
this charger has been used more by my children than me . 
it is powerful and very easy to operate and clean . 
nice item ,  the italic letting adds a nice touch . 
a little heavy like other people have said but sooo what . 
once you have bluetooth enabled on your phone ,  everything else works smooth . 
i would consider it a really great investment . 
i m always dropping my phone in the car . 
i m a fan of progesso soups and stagg chilies . 
this slow cooker is a step above the rest . 
other accessories in my kitchen are brushed stainless stell so this matches perfectly . 
i have many electronic i can used this with . 
this product goes with the food saver to seal the bags with . 
it s perfect for making three or four good sized cups of coffee . 
a storage bag is so convenient to keep the lines from getting everywhere . 
these are a great companion to the show and serve cake boards . 
the trays easily come out if they need to be cleaned . 
works great and looks lovely on my counter . 
do remember your manners when dealings with all people . 
it s perfectly in keeping with the good quality of the product . 
neither did i . the kettle is very easy to clean . 
i use this the most of all my kitchen gizmo s !  . 
these trays are cheap and last for years . 
now i don t have to worry about my battery . 
i have used this and find it works well . 
i upgraded to this press after having a cheaper metal press for years . 
only thing i done was clean it first thing with vinegar . 
the old hook works better with wetter doughs . 
some reds might even benefit from double decanting with aeration at each decanting . 
this gorgeous design dresses up a counter and makes coffee brewing a snap . 
it just kept going until the switch in the handle stopped working . 
i look forward to adding more of these pans to my collection !  . 
after i got the disc installed properly  concave !   it worked great . 
i am not using it for anything but my electric drip coffee maker . 
i ve done nothing but deep fry with it . 
it s also easy to clean ,  at least with shortbread dough . 
price is great and the coffee tastes great . 
just received it in the mail and i am very pleased . 
this is extremely unlikely to happen with a kaiser la forme pan . 
as with any technology ,  one must work within its design limits . 
in fact i think doing this hurts them in the long run . 
the quiet and power makes it a dream to work with . 
i think my oven had issues for those . 
the bottom of the rubber is falling off on both batteries . 
overall ,  a great product from motorola that i d eagerly recommend . 
almost immediately the brewing stopped and the percolator became silent . 
the only feature i miss is dual source support . 
my oh my !  this is the thing to have . 
this is a good useable addition to anyone s kitchen . 
the pour spout has a screen to filter out any sediment . 
other than dad way more than what the price would suggest . 
they have stickers that say made in usa at least . 
and because henckels only has this spoonzwilling j . a . 
i was sick of using it and bought this microplane . 
they were easy to pair up with my cell phone and my laptop . 
will always use this one if i break or lose one . 
i would recommend the oxo steel garlic press for these num_extend
i use this for my homemade almond milk . 
i bought this for my son and he loves it . 
i bought this screen protector so i could have peace of mind . 
you could even fit three slices if they are narrow enough . 
i use this one almost every other day . 
it s certainly worth it to have the protection . 
i had never heard of yogurt cheese until i happened on an article . 
we use ours for flour ,  sugar ,  and brown sugar . 
we are definitely sold on investing in top quality knives from now on . 
i also like the screen positioned on top for pouring . 
so i went to order the black matte version but they were backordered . 
it s a nice case and not bad for the price . 
this included playing with a couple friends  bluetooth speakers . 
nothing ever sticks and i can use it multiple times . 
pretty cool but i wish that it would stand the other way . 
the num_extend of app memory on the sensation is plenty for me . 
i will be buying sheets in different sizes . 
it perfectly fits the smaller eye of an electric stove . 
just change the quantity of milk to num_num oz . 
it s sturdy and cuts the dough just fine . 
the only problem with the previous version was the fit . 
this is a terrific price for trying out the calphalon line . 
wouldn t even know he was using a headset . 
i also ordered the non serrated blade ,  which i normally use . 
although ,  when i did break my glass decanter ,  mr . 
i like the weight of the glass too . 
after i ordered ,  it went up to $
not a big difference than the other better screen protectors out there . 
cellphones just are not comfortable to talk on for long periods of time . 
bought one for my daughter ,  too ,  and she loves it !  . 
i can see at a glance just how cool it is . 
this prevents the blade from moving or rubbing up against num_extend
these are the best filter on the market . 
it takes me num_num minutes to get a loaf going . 
i bought the scoop one size larger about a year ago . 
talk about convenient !  i also get compliments galore when people see it . 
this case fits my iphone num_num great and i received it on time . 
the heating element gave out on my old one after num_num years . 
it can hold a ton of music ,  video ,  and photos . 
material seems like it is of great quality . 
it arrived in perfect shape and on time . 
measuring cups are a long term investment for most cooks . 
not a single bubble formed during the process . 
this is just what i was looking for . 
this is a great item ,  at a very affordable price . 
the biggest plus is that the rice actually tastes better . 
i ve tossed all my plastic containers in favor for these . 
we cooked steel cut oats and other breakfast cereals in it . 
if you can spring for the money give it a try . 
it s totally beautiful  bigger than it looks in pics  . 
for the first time i feel like the floors are clean . 
this pan is top of the line at a great price . 
i use it all the time almost for every meal i cook . 
i am ordering another one for my daughter . 
i had to recharge it a zillion times a day . 
there are three very significant considerations in buying one of these . 
it actually fits perfectly on my counter ,  beneath the cabinets . 
i love that the handles are one with the cup . 
as far as color coding ,  i don t bother with that . 
the best thing i like about this set is its size . 
this pot is fast and easy to use . 
i have had my panini grill for two years now . 
i dropped my phone on the street and it has not a scratch . 
i bought a squaretrade warranty for the big stuff . 
i was making calls in about num_num seconds . 
instead of finding my old one i found the samsung one . 
this battery has been very strong so far . 
sound is crisp and clear ,  arrived quickly and works well . 
i was very surprised at how well it cleaned my floors . 
it arrived right on time and in great condition . 
i can fit corningware pans with the domed lids and knobs on top . 
overall ,  they are a good quality product for the money . 
it does the trick and has held up well so far . 
whatever the case ,  i am super happy with my purchase . 
when i first got my hands on the device i was disappointed . 
they take up a lot of storage space when not in use . 
so far ,  the wire is holding up fine . 
i would recommend for anyone who owns the htc . 
i purchased my own just a few days ago . 
will be buying more attachments as i get better . 
the price was right and they are lightweight and sturdy . 
this was not an issue with the norpro num_num pizza peel and paddle . 
i really like this case for the most part . 
it turned a nasty ugly color like molten lead . 
i use it for skype and just for listening to music and stuff . 
its lightweight but i don t feel it is cheap . 
i would recommend to others ,  the cookies bake well on the surface . 
so the mixer will fit on a counter under shelves . 
i was introduced to this instrument by atk . 
if you re careless like me ,  this thing can take a beating . 
maybe the handle is simply more difficult to grip . 
i went looking for passiveantenna solutions ,  opting for this one . 
i like it much better than the ear bud things i ve used . 
so this was just what i needed for her . 
this pattern coordinates well with other other sets and holds up really well . 
it protects you phone like it s suppose to . 
and i ve yet to see this in any other headset . 
good fit in the ear without any problems . 
love le creuset and this little version was affordable . 
i disliked wired systems because i found the tangling of the wires annoying . 
the other is the handle can t be removed without bending wire . 
after that first fiasco ,  my homemade ice cream has been yummy !  . 
just wipe it off into the pan  or whatever  and keep going . 
i cook on it every day and love this guy . 
fortunately i noticed and did not stick my hand in without looking . 
the handles are a little small ,  but it s manageable . 
i have had this  toy  for about one week . 
this is exactly what you need to seal wide mouth ball jars . 
i have no regret to have bought this case . 
the oven adjusts the toast setting if it is warm already . 
the primary lure to this product was the price and the good reviews . 
rices potatoes quickly and easily ,  easy to work with and to clean . 
it produces a beautiful cake that pops out easily . 
i have num_num of these and have never had one crack or break . 
i still would not use it as the primary charger for an ipad . 
this one works perfectly and is simple to use . 
i would recommend this grinder for coffee beans . 
never use that one as this one does the job so much better . 
the design of the maker is very handy as well . 
they are small , and the spring clip is plenty strong as well . 
this juicer is by far the best quality and price . 
useful for casual parties as serving trays and as all purpose prep boards . 
this grill doesn t have a timer like the large one did . 
had been looking for a shaker with a removal lid . 
it is big and a pain to store . 
i wanted a dark blue but this looks a bit purple . 
pops the corn perfect everytime and then serves as a serving bowl too . 
this lovely sunflower bowl sets a beautiful table . 
this is a very simple and reliable timer . 
the dough never sticks ,  and the pizzas come out great . 
these glasses are very high quality at a very good price . 
i m picky about water though ,  so maybe it s just me . 
overall full value for money and a very good buy at this price . 
i need something that can be tucked away . 
i would like to emphasize on one thing ,  the price . 
so ,  long story short ,  i am pleased thus far . 
this cable works with the new nexus num_num num_num edition . 
only have a few bubbles around one edge . 
this is an ideal gift for a french press coffee lover . 
this case for the thunderbolt is no exception . 
this is one of those products that i wish i could really keep . 
you can take out the interior if it is too bulky for you . 
i liked it so much i bought two . 
i would recommend the num_num cup if you have a larger family . 
used some little effort and then it popped out really nice . 
the model may have become old but has retained its popularity . 
these paring knives are simply the best i have ever seen or used . 
no plastic in our coffee !  this percolator is all stainless steel . 
it works great and we loved the pasta it makes . 
every thing about this scream quality and function . 
the reasonable price brings the value of its form and function all together . 
thus i often had wine going to waste after a few days . 
she loves that it covers the front of the phone besides the screen . 
i got this as a gift and i think it is fabulous . 
this unit is lighter then many similar devices . 
this gel case is a perfect fit for the tracfone num_extend
one of the most useful items in my kitchen !  . 
it is light weight and easy to put together . 
i replaced my old filter after a few years . 
i recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook . 
very fast ,  shuts off automatically when the water is boiled . 
anyway ,  the spinner is really sturdy and looks nice . 
she uses it a couple of times a week and really likes it . 
we only hard cook and on occasion softer cook eggs . 
it says hot for hours after the oven is off . 
it s small and lite weight , so far no problems . 
you will want to dump out the whey after only about ten minutes . 
just got this free with my upgraded kitchenaid . 
this is a terribly awesome product in my subaru s console . 
haven t had any issues with different size apples . 
i got this for my dad for his birthday . 
if you re looking for something sturdier ,  this won t be it . 
great quality and can easily recommend to others . 
these are cheap and do their job so well . 
i don t know why since music sounds great . 
i keep it in my purse or bag . 
i have had them for num_num months and no broken glasses yet . 
easy to clean and stores flat in the drawer . 
still if you break it ,  this is the replacement that is possible . 
i ve never experienced any sliding ,  or coming ungripped yet . 
low price on the product plus free shipping . 
i use my saucepan and num_num inch saute  pan the most . 
i like the shape ,  weight ,  and accuracy of these measuring spoons . 
i do have to angle the base to get it to seat propery . 
this can be easily  fixed  with electrical or duct tape . 
with others the lips and sound look like a poor language dub . 
lasted a good year and a half before he totally broke it . 
no ,  there is no way to pour without removing the lid . 
i use them for making buns ,  biscuits ,  pie crusts etc . 
easy to wash in dishwasher and odd sizes come in handy . 
i can see why others would empty theirs outside only . 
the quality was great and the item arrived on time . 
this unit is being used for my itouch . 
the surface is smooth and got a velvet soft touch . 
nor am i a bread aficionado  read :  elitist  . 
this popper just could not be any easier . 
i never use them for pressure cooking food . 
we have used these for several months now and are completely satisfied . 
the charger is perfect ,  and the batteries work well so far . 
no burned parts or areas that stuck to the pan . 
turning the unit on didn t take over the phone call . 
but then if i want a longer cord i have the option . 
what it makes is good enough to use in recipes for filler . 
i like the wilton num_num inch angled spatula . 
it s a great quality cast iron frying pan and it looks good . 
we ve juiced everything from small grapefruit to limes with great success . 
a num_num second zap in the microwave will help . 
these are also sunglasses compatible unlike the motorola num_extend or the jabra backbeats . 
i have the note num_num and i couldnt ask for a better case . 
you do not need any tools to put together or take apart . 
connecting the device to my iphone was simple . 
i can see at a quick glance what spices are in the bottles . 
i was constantly messing with bubbles with my previous screen protector . 
a matching lid makes it even more versatile . 
light ,  sharp ,  good in the hand ,  and easy to clean . 
maybe that s why my son doesn t like to sleep on it . 
i wanted to find something big ,  quick ,  and easy to clean . 
i bought this specifically to use for making cupcakes and it works perfectly . 
they are very pretty and come with a cover . 
this is the best headset i have ever used . 
it s perfect for my iphone num_extend num_extend hot spot ,  and ipad . 
the stainless steel option is my num_extend choice . 
took a whole month or more to get it . 
but this is fine for two or three people . 
bought this machine after our gevalia gave out . 
i like it ,  but the material it was made can bend easily . 
razor sharp out of the box as one would expect from wusthof . 
i love the permanent filter ,  no need to buy the paper ones . 
it s just what i needed to make the well water tasting good . 
grilling time is very fast with it closed . 
it defaults to not checked for broadest app compatibility . 
the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put . 
it s big ,  easy to handle ,  and high quality . 
fits my samsung galaxy s num_extend num_extend perfectly . 
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray . 
it s been in the dishwasher ,  dropped on the floor ,  etc . 
if you want to protect your phone this is the case for you . 
of course ,  there are less bold colors available too . 
i cannot say enough good about this waffler . 
i chose the refund and this process was completed quickly . 
and it makes a nice dessert for entertaining . 
it drys the lids nicely when set out of the pot . 
connects and works as it should made well too  ! a great find . 
the pan is nice and solid ,  not heavy . 
i purchased num_num sets of num_num after christmas along with the breakfast set . 
it does a terrific job and is reflective of the legendary wusthof quality . 
it holds pretty good weight ,  large coats and all . 
regular size ,  a little on the thin side but they work fine . 
one of my previous blenders was a cuisinart . 
this case has a relatively grippy  not sticky  inner silicone shell . 
i d buy another one if i needed it for another room . 
takes a while to get used to ,  but helped my eye strain . 
these rolls are the best way of doing that . 
minus one star . i like the look ,  not that bulky . 
i bought this product for a former phone i had . 
they are not exaggerating when they call this the slim fit case . 
we put the phone on straight talk and we are loving it . 
when your fingers are slimy  making meatballs ,  etc . 
my wife had the same problem with her covers as well . 
no inconvenience whatsoever . the sound quality of this bt was amazing . 
num_num hrs of talk time and days of standby . 
if you want a timer ,  this is it !  . 
bought this as a gift for a wine lover . 
they look stylish and appear to be made well . 
the apples fall apart and the peeling process becomes uneven . 
the blue light is bright but not distractiing . 
loved it so much ,  i bought one for my wife too . 
i found them on amazon at a more reasonable price . 
the thing makes a perfect cup of coffee every time . 
the battery indictor flashes green intermittently before turning off . 
bought enough so i won t run out for quite some time . 
i have two other sizes of this scoop and i love them all . 
they nest nicely and feel substantial in the hand . 
it hangs in the closet without taking up more space than a skirt . 
this knife makes me want to throw out my wustof chef knife . 
bought a kuvings num_extend centrifugal juicer from amazon . 
this is a beautiful smooth black leather holster with nice stitching . 
if mine ever breaks ,  i ll definitely buy another !  . 
can t believe how nice these spoons are for the price . 
i ve been using this for over a year . 
but the product itself is not perfect if you want perfect . 
there is plenty of cooking space on this smaller griddle . 
it is actually louder than my evo num_extend was . 
i never use the attachments but they are there if you want them . 
this one feels much lighter and its walls look so thin . 
i really like the shape of the kitchenaid mixer . 
the labeling is color coded on the rubber portion of each handle . 
after my purchase  ,  the price went down considerable . 
the first three speeds are slow ,  or stirring ,  speeds . 
it holds a full num_num oz .  ,  about num_num mugs worth . 
had a motorola and didn t care much for it . 
this grinder gets the job done quickly ,  which i like . 
this was a excellent choice and i am glad i made this purchase . 
this is the single best gift you can give anyone who likes cooking . 
i got the idea from a world famous steak house in oklahoma . 
to start out you want to follow instructions to season the cookware . 
no complaints as this will work well in the car . 
it peels cleanly and makes the job a lot easier . 
this fan is perfect for cooling down my room at night . 
really good as a mirror and screen protector . 
if you have to think about it you need counseling . 
i m going to try brown basmati rice this weekend . 
so i think this product comes from a spanish motorola inventory . 
i have some of the additional attachments which work great . 
i use it for gps getting turn by turn directions . 
i will continue to try and hope this is better with grapefruit . 
if you ve never cooked on stone before ,  prepare to be amazed . 
also as its aluminum it s much lighter weight for the trailer . 
you will love them each time you reach for one !  . 
this is not your heavy duty protector but it works great for me . 
update ,  july num_extend see below for comments about this pot vs . 
our favorite is the french countryside bread in the recipe book . 
that is not what this item is designed to do . 
other than that ,  it makes popcorn pretty well . 
it has just about everything that you need for your kitchenaid mixer . 
i can tell it to shut off that s about it . 
assembly is easy and can be performed in minutes . 
serviceable ,  sharp ,  good kitchen scissors for medium light tasks . 
no more guessing what they put in the ground meat !  . 
the outer case clamps the silicon case in place . 
i also bought the set with wide noodle and angel hair cutters . 
this is a definate must for those of us to love to bake . 
now i want a set for out kitchen . 
also make sure it doesn t block any important car information screen . 
has expected a little hard to position but the fit is good . 
small form factor makes it easy to carry . 
you have to figure out how long to cook it ,  though . 
i used these at a local crab feed . 
so it has a good longevity to the battery . 
it worked well ,  but doesn t come with a flattening tool . 
the price is the same i paid in num_extend
i don t understand how that could be possible . 
with only one microphone ,  it can not do noise cancellation . 
the fit is snug and the deep purple is attractive . 
i replaced one i had that was over num_num years old . 
just use a protective film and you ll be fine . 
i bought this charger because i needed an extra ,  i misplaced mine . 
i found the  keep warm  function to be unhelpful . 
i volunteer my time cleaning at a cat rescue . 
time will tell me how well it works ,  and we ll see . 
thee were purchased to offer protection for camping knives for boy scouts . 
popcorn is cheap ,  so i don t worry about the kernels . 
i enjoy having a large selection of sizes . 
it s the protection you need for your device . 
i have owned exactly two braun drip coffeemakers over the last num_num years . 
i bought this bread machine for my girl for christmas num_extend
kept cool because it is in cool water all day . 
that end is making perfect alcoholic whipped creams . 
i ve been using this bluetooth for num_num weeks daily . 
we ate  real whipped cream  throughout the holiday . 
this is a great charger for almost any phone . 
easy to clean  usually none required  ,  doesn t heat up the kitchen . 
the oven is quiet ,  efficient and cooks food well . 
i didn t think they were to loud like some did . 
it finally pooped out on me in num_extend
this battery charges just like the original ,  and lasts just as long . 
i thought there was an extra stock pot included . 
one for tea and one for my minnow trap for holding bait . 
i m looking forward to trying other lodge logic products . 
i have practiced with several kettles at different stores . 
i usually make toast ,  and it works great . 
i bought a plantronics num_extend at the same time to compare . 
looks good with dainty tea cups or everyday mug . 
i like that you can calibrate this thermometer if its off . 
i bought one last year and it s one of my favorite covers . 
otherwise ,  a just about perfect electric water dispensing pot . 
i especially like this one for making gravies and sauces . 
it is a real handful to hold this peppermill . 
when i say all day long ,  i mean it . 
i used this as soon as it came in . 
case holds all of this in one convenient place . 
i bought this because it was inexpensive and had free shipping . 
it works like the very expensive otterbox cases but for half the price . 
i also have a much larger bose bluetooth speaker . 
i saw this on amazon and purchased it . 
it heats well and cooks everything including pancakes i think superbly . 
this pan will last a you a long time . 
i loved the shape and the cake just slides out . 
i used the first one for probably num_num to num_num years . 
so a dysfunctional cheese slicer real take the luxury out of it . 
at the price they are impossible to beat . 
the actual plate heats up very fast compared to my stove . 
i bought this one to replace my little black and decker toaster oven . 
my family loves pizza and we usually make it weekly . 
this scoop can cut through rock solid ice cream like a dream . 
the first instruction was to wash the grids with soapy water . 
this unit seems sturdy and i hope it lasts a long time . 
i paired this headset to my iphone right out of the box . 
i just put this case on my iphone num_extend and really like it . 
i use these little bowls all the time along with the covers . 
i would buy them again as you get your money s worth . 
i must say that i recommend this blender highly . 
this is a high quality headset made by plantronics . 
for apps with small points to press it is great . 
the quality of the materials ,  craftsmanship and design are always superb . 
the handle angle makes pouring easy ,  unlike some kettles . 
maybe some high powered science type people can comment on this probability . 
no company could match the coffee i d make at home . 
very versatile ,  and lovely to look at as well . 
the medium set is more comfortable for me . 
it is old fashioned quality and i really like it . 
so far ,  i am very happy with this purchase . 
heat your water up first before pouring it into the reservoir . 
it fits my phone perfectly ,  adding no bulk at all . 
dropped into the sink ,  and silky applesauce into a bowl . 
somehow ,  my original whisk got damaged and made a horrible sound . 
i haven t dropped it yet ,  but so far so good . 
this griddle is a perfect size for pancakes . 
this product is the best mandolin i ve tried so far . 
i felt almost immediately better than i had . 
imax power s customer service is great as well . 
i ve been researching large humidifiers and they all seem to be flawed . 
i have tried several coffee makers but to no satisfaction . 
have used it many times and it is still sharp . 
i used this in making my pies for thanksgiving this year . 
some how i had lost my garlic press so replaced it . 
if i could award this product six stars i would do it . 
heavy vinyl keeps the straight and not bunched num_extend
first ,  turning it off manually means unplugging it from the wall . 
bought this as a gift for my husband . 
i don t think i ll be waiting too much longer though . 
i have used waiters corkscrews ,  wing style corkscrews and cork pullers . 
google maps is easy and fun to use and includes latitude . 
we had a plastic one that cracked on us . 
i have tried all kinds of grills ,  even those with  drain holes  . 
and the stain didn t wash out with soap and water . 
they were cheaper here than at my local store . 
it is best for when i am gone on a trip . 
might have to splurge on one of these for myself !  . 
omg i love the way it juices greens . 
i did not spray them or coat them with anything . 
fortunately ,  my original retaining ring still worked fine . 
i do expect everything to work when i get it . 
i received the garlic keeper in excellent shape . 
i would like to invest in a couple of different sizes . 
it was very reasonably priced online verse the cell phone carrier . 
i ve had several of these types of cases over the years . 
nice size for soup stocks or stews or simply cooking pasta . 
he probably does that num_num times a day ,  num_num days a week . 
price is right !  i store them between the nesting pans . 
a great peeler ,  that requires minimum pressure to get an effective peel . 
it s especially good for storing whole bean coffee in the frig . 
lets you keep the phone vertical in a cup holder or other . 
i ve only had it for about num_num weeks though . 
i would recommend this especially for the low price . 
i love this little kitchen tool and its accessories . 
the bins drop in ,  and are completely removable . 
rim has finally recognized that us mac users carrys bbs . 
i ve now had my juice pack for about a month now . 
the handle stays cool which is a nice bonus . 
it seems other models are trying to stand out in color or style . 
it is a good bluetooth for its price . 
i ve had it for a long time ,  and i like it . 
the savings i receive with this type of storage is tremendous . 
it cuts into my hands before it starts to move . 
mine have worked well and do not require being greased to prevent sticking . 
there is no comparison between android market and blackberry app world . 
the  extra  lift is minimal .  .  . approximately num_num inch or so . 
a cleaning brush is also a good investment . 
i make these for him and wow they are good . 
it should just do what it says it does . 
works great !  much cheaper than the  name brand  stainless tampers . 
for the price of these screen protectors i would definitely order these again . 
surely they could have altered the design to keep that from happening . 
didn t need to cut it or tried to get any bubbles out . 
this is my first experience with a pasta maker . 
bag of flour ,  and the num_num gallon size does . 
i used to keep just a plastic bag on the front porch . 
even fully extended the cord is rather short and extremely stiff . 
although a kitchen veteran ,  i m relatively new to baking . 
they seem sturdy enough ,  no different from the original apple cables . 
i love speck products stylish ,  protects my phone . 
it provides very crisp pizzas and is easy to use . 
turns out this is far and away the best of them all . 
this will blend with the espresso creating harmony of the flavor . 
don t use cooking oil ,  because it will go rancid . 
keep them clean and wrapped in the freezer . 
i purchased this item due to the good reviews . 
lodge really does a great job with their products . 
i have had the sharpener for over num_num years . 
i bought this case when i bought my iphone early this year . 
it is very quiet and the chopping quality is far superior . 
the time to clean the sheets is less than cleaning your counter . 
just what we needed to return our old mixer to new . 
i bought this wood spatula for my new woks . 
plugged in the booster ,  two green lights came on . 
i luv this item and also love to bake cakes and breads . 
works out to under $ per box inclusive of shippping . 
i will probably buy a few others of this same style . 
one of the most useful items in my kitchen . 
i really don t have much else to say ,  besides that . 
i have been able to surf the internet where others had zero signal . 
i got this needing something that can take punishment . 
the height is easily adjustable and they are easy to assemble . 
they really are a pleasure to hold and look at . 
it has num_num setting ,  the fastest setting is very loud . 
this was the cheapest i could find them without buying in bulk . 
i have a few different covers and like to switch them out . 
we are thinking about selling them around town to make some extra money . 
very durable and the handles are very sturdy . 
its a bit difficult taking off and putting on . 
no dribbling water on the counter when you fill it . 
but do not let these mild critisizements stop you from buying this machine . 
it ensures that there are no giant chunks . 
i look forward to many years of use . 
we started out with a different brand that turned out to be defective . 
overall the best case you can get for an iphone . 
so a case that combines both is ideal . 
i am brutal on my dishes and have owned corelle for years . 
they are as described and exactly as they appear in the online image . 
the finish is outstanding and the product is rugged . 
the fit is superb and secure ,  and screen protectors are not affected . 
always move to the carafe for a great cup of coffee . 
you will be limited only by your imagination and your tastes . 
the paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on . 
just got my iphone num_extend ordered the iphone num_num version of these yesterday . 
my iphone behaved normally while i waited for the replacement battery to arrive . 
it has a few spots that could have been polished more . 
the included recipe is good and worth a try . 
i was having the local supermarket slice my meat . 
if you are going to be doing big numbers ,  it is great . 
the pot was just the perfect compliment to my set up !  . 
bought it as a gift for my sister ,  and she loved it . 
on first appearance ,  the design of the epic is mouth watering . 
i purchased it on monday and had it in my hands on thursday . 
give them a wipe and you are ready for the next batch . 
it has lasted me a long time but has broke . 
i like the deep sides and the diameter is perfect for my burners . 
this is the perfect utensil drying rack for my odd dish rack . 
hats off to native union for producing a high quality product . 
the wonder it has brought to my life is indescribable . 
i ordered this as an extra bowl for my cuisinart ice cream maker . 
the only flaw is the cord might be a bit short . 
the design of this machine shows much consideration for the end user . 
i now use them to control the temperature of my dry curing cabinet . 
this beaker is marked num_num cups ,  and num_num ml num_extend cups  . 
recommended it to a neighbor and they are just as happy . 
the extra attachments are great and work really well . 
the gloss black looks so much better ,  very happy with it . 
i think this case is a fantastic case . 
it would not connect with the thicker apple bumper case . 
this is a must for any sprint galaxy s ii owner . 
additionally ,  the consistency of the grinds appears to be very good . 
these are cheap enough to replace should i scratch the screen . 
even after roasting for hours ,  the pan is easy to clean . 
it looks solid and looks good on the countertop . 
the assembly ,  though simple ,  is a little difficult . 
they are very stylish and have a nice weight to them . 
does not heat the water nor does it keep it warm . 
the wood is nice and the pick is quite functional . 
i just use the cover back sometimes and it pops right out . 
i ve had this blender for years and it still works . 
no question ,  my iphone would survive being dropped while wearing this case . 
another nice oxo product to add to the rest of the collection . 
because of the design ,  its will tip and topple the stand backwards . 
it is not designed to take the direct heat . 
it works very easily and loads easily ,  too . 
again ,  i stand by it being used improperly to cause bouncing . 
the ka num_num has changed my baking life . 
why did i buy knife sharpener ?  all my knives were very dull . 
i am not a big fan of the clunky pan locking mechanism . 
the only downside would be that it is a tab bit bulky . 
it fits % to each phone i ve purchased for . 
it has a great size for both reservoirs . 
no complaints !  i may buy a few more to have spares around . 
so ,  not a bad gift for the price !  . 
don t expect too much from cables that are so cheap . 
the samsung num_extend works perfectly with my treo num_extend
this knife is so nimble and a blast to use . 
this item works as designed and has been working very well since purchased . 
after about the sixth cycle the coffee will start to taste exquisite . 
at first ,  i thought it may be too small ,  too thin . 
the lid and spatula are nice additions to throw in with it . 
i love that it is small and compact . 
fit the phone perfectly and was easy to put on . 
we gently smear it on with finger tips . 
in the past the domes got lost on the bottom of the pot . 
i don t know why i waited so long to purchase these . 
my only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design . 
they go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven . 
great coffeemaker and this is our num_extend of this model . 
i may order a second one since i have filled it up . 
it takes a little extra scraping to clear the bowl . 
you get a large amount for a small price ,  fast shipping too . 
i am also on a tight ,  tight budget . 
we now get num_num bars in areas where we only got num_extend
some menu selections need one touch ,  others need two . 
everybody who likes to prepare food at home should have a garlic press . 
got over num_num screen protectors from this seller . 
this is another product i would highly recommend . 
this is absolutely the best ipod case availalble . 
i owned a cuisinart grind and brew and thought it was terrific . 
bread rise was very good given the boost of instant high heat . 
i am a little embarrassed i didn t just start with this machine . 
now i have to get a new one for my iphone num_extend
i don t even realize it is on my person . 
i am quite mystified at the terrible reviews this crock pot has recieved . 
i especially like the large wide bottom which gives me more cooking space . 
i put my keurig on top and the cups in the basket . 
my old jar broke and i bought this whole set . 
the case adds very little thickness or num_extend
because of its great size ,  i can easily reach inside . 
only issue with simple reception in some areas especially in the basement . 
can use in smaller bowls as well as larger bowls . 
you will need a screen protector along with this product . 
very different than just a clear screen protector . 
this product was completely worth the money spent !  . 
i did not return them because it was my fault . 
the only difference is that it did not come with the velcro strap . 
the screen points into the holster ,  which is lined with felt . 
the coffee came out perfect !  i highly recommend west bend brand . 
the quality is as good as the original . 
otterbox makes a very high quality product with great protection . 
the evidence is clear every time we change these filters . 
we use it for everything :  fish , chicken ,  steak ,  etc . 
i therefore came online looking for something sturdier and more dependable . 
you insert a single pod in the filter holder  designed for pods  . 
okay ,  for the price and battery life ,  this is outstanding . 
they are comfortable enough to wear for a while . 
food will stick if you run it too hot . 
 :   otherwise ,  the function of the pan itself was fine . 
the coffee tastes good no matter how much is made . 
i ordered the wrong size ,  but it turned out just fine . 
i ve had mine for over a year and i love the phone . 
my last one  a popiel  gave up the ghost after num_num years . 
the films are nice and invisible once i put one on the phone . 
this was obvious when i washed the floor . 
i find that most microwave ovens have limited appeal to me . 
it is small and it don t take up a lot of space . 
nice to have a second one on hand when needed . 
there s nothing bad to say about the jabra products . 
never worry about battery life especially when travelling on the road or such . 
cool for num_num minutes and fill with your favorite fillings . 
if you read the instructions ,  you will know this . 
don t make the mistake of getting the num_num instead of the num_extend
i ve had this screen protector on my phone for a while now . 
definitely worth the money i paid for it . 
plus they seem to hold up really well . 
i only wish that it came in blue . 
i used them for hours on multiple occasions . 
the bluetooth is comfortable but not for a long period of time . 
this is the perfect bluetooth headset so far . 
it is amazing the cooking time these pots can do a job . 
they were very expensive at the time and very heavy . 
that s all i ask and i got it . 
these work well and they are very small to store . 
let s see how long it s life will be . 
but then ,  that is my mistake as the price is appropriate . 
the only thing it hasn t yet beaten is the lodge cast iron . 
where did you dry your pasta before you bought this num_extend
i ve had this case for about num_num months now . 
i wish the rubber feet is a little longer . 
even those cool down quickly if they are opened frequently . 
pretty much anything you could need a bowl for these will perform wonderfully . 
i wanted a smart phone with no contract and a reasonable monthly rate . 
i would recommend using your own num_extend party for better music quality . 
the dock has a very clean look as well . 
very solid and sturdy and i bet they ll outlive me . 
this sauce pan is great for a small family . 
the quality is precisely what i expected from otter box . 
i purchased two of these knives and i m happy with their performance . 
don t freak out if it looks like there are tons of bubbles . 
they worked well for measuring flour and sugar . 
very nice !  our next cooker will also be a zojirushi for sure . 
worth the money  and it was a good price  . 
the reception with the antenna was just not there . 
  .  .  .   i am very happy with this purchase . 
i returned it and will buy a smaller one . 
never heard back any issue form their end . 
i ended up paying $ bucks and ordered the lid . 
we did notice a few changes from the previous version . 
but they work well ,  are very reasonably priced and highly recommended . 
this is a fairly well made shelf for the price . 
it brews coffee about halfway between espresso and regular coffee . 
this baby provides more protection than the otterbox defender i have . 
my iphone num_extend screen protector is compatible with this case . 
arrived as described and so far has functioned as it should . 
it is perfect for focaccia ,  flat breads and other baked products . 
i bought this for and use it with tom clancys endwar . 
this is a great case with great protection . 
i ve read reviews that say it makes a great dog dish too . 
they work fine and are easy to clean . 
it is a good charger and does what it is supposed to do . 
there isn t a lot to say about these . 
this is a hand made item ,  with decent quality . 
i got it for my father in law and we loved it . 
it s a little aggravating but it doesn t happen all the num_extend
when i squeeze the handle it feels heavy duty and not flimsy . 
btw ,  it was packed very well and arrived in perfect condition . 
very useful product to keep towels wherever needed . 
can t say enough about i am absolutely thrilled with this purchase . 
it has been used on the stove top and a propane camp stove . 
i don t understand why some people reviewed this one not that great . 
still going strong after being used once a week . 
i did not oil the pan and the pizza popped out easily . 
they really work great with my both my phones . 
this was one of my favorite cases for my num_extend
for such a low price i didn t expect much . 
strap doesn t touch or pull on neck like all others tried . 
i am sending a few to my friends and family . 
this case has allowed me to do just that . 
i ordered this for my droid x to mount in my car . 
perfect size and width for mixing smaller batches of batter . 
i also didn t like the labeling of the included cables . 
yes ,  it even talks . ok i made that last part up . 
i received this in the mail within just a few days . 
its quick ,  efficient and for me a major time saver . 
i m new to cooking and this pan is insane . 
i used these to replace most of my plastic containers . 
the narrow blade is excellent for really getting in there . 
i ve had this for a couple of years . 
i have wanted one of these and found this on amazon . 
the two batteries are good for back up only . 
the fact that it costs so much less than the otterbox is fantastic . 
it saves time ,  energy and creates beautiful flavors . 
i bought three to match the three bluetooth colors i purchased . 
for the price ,  this nutmeg grater works well . 
it took me exactly num_num minutes to do each side . 
you get use to them fast and doint want to use it . 
it s guarateed for three years a lot of bang for the buck . 
but got paid with in num_num business days . 
i purchased this to go with the other kitchenaid attachments i have . 
don t forget the filter elements it does not come with one . 
it came quickly and at a much lower price than anyone else . 
no paper filter or plastic body to worry about . 
i made some sizable pie pops with these . 
the package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen . 
looks good ,  has no extra rubber bumpers for shock absorption . 
don t force just find the grooves to screw in place . 
i highly recommend the product and the distributer . 
it makes the jam look so much nicer ,  more like a gift . 
i waited many years desiring a kitchenaid mixer . 
i love the sound it makes whenever i slide my fingers across it . 
serves it s purpose ,  but could serve it alot better . 
i expect to enjoy them for many years to come . 
they look good ,  feel comfortable and are intuitive to use . 
i am very pleased with this electric ice tea maker . 
the size is perfect for one pan family meals . 
i especially appreciate the added aux out option . 
the times given for cooking are an estimate . 
at this point i wondered if it was the headphones or the computer . 
someone at melitta dropped the ball on this one . 
it takes about one and one half minutes to cook two eggs . 
less than half the price of similar products advertised on tv . 
this machine is just fabulous and well worth its purchase price . 
i do not find the crumb tray a problem . 
i am absolutely in love with this pan . 
and the stainless steel rack they come with is great too . 
go buy the incipio silicrylic hard shell case with silicone core . 
the instructions say to wipe with a damp cloth . 
i bought this case for my mom s galaxy s . 
this is the best pressure cooker that i ve ever seen . 
they came out better than anything i could cut by hand . 
it does what it is supposed to do . 
this last type is like the particle board of leathers . 
i m slowly replacing all of my kitchen utensils with stainless steel ones . 
for this glove ,  a medium would be better . 
only issue has been overflow at the top if i grind too fine . 
its also more convenient because it does everything for you . 
the pitcher also works great for mixing powdered milk . 
it is easy to use ,  easy to clean and makes no mess . 
they are also roughly the size of a crayon  a little bigger  . 
i would rather know it s on just by num_extend
i would recommend these to any wine drinker . 
everyone should have a few of these in their kitchen . 
it saved me a trip to the store to find them . 
once i found the correct place ,  it was acceptable in that regard . 
these batteries are of very good quality for the price . 
setup is extremely easy and have had no other problems with the device . 
great teaball for one or two cups of tea . 
much smoother than messing with all the cords . 
when you put it back together ,  it s solid again . 
like it so much i bought one for my sister . 
i ve had no real problems with this pot . 
i would do business with this company again . 
it saves a lot of time scrubbing the microwave . 
no complaints ,  no breaking ,  not anything ,  it just worked . 
this unit does it for my num_num cup cuisinart . 
easy to use and a great buy for the price !  . 
wow ,  i have to say these really impressed me . 
the muffins fell out of the pan easily when following correct directions . 
i use an iphone for anything more than casual checks on news sites . 
it doesn t look like much but works perfect . 
i like the soft covers more than the hard shell covers . 
it is just a workhorse of an oven . 
for several months now ,  i have not had this problem . 
it fit comfortably and it sounds nice like all bose products . 
personally i think the issue is widely overblown . 
so much quicker and so much neater with this scooper . 
how many things can you say that about ?  practically none . 
bought this for a friend as he wanted a small crock pot . 
fiesta ware is going to be permanently on her wish list . 
i was looking for an omelet maker for a long time . 
it s ok with me cuz i like the real color better . 
i am surprised by this poor design feature in such a clever instrument . 
however it does look a bit odd because i have a white evo . 
the button takes some getting used to in my opinion . 
the grip is great and the helping is perfect . 
the sleek exterior and rounded top are great for keeping in the open . 
nice thick case that gives my phone plenty of protection . 
it is just a set of brita water filter pitcher replacement filters . 
after reading good reviews i purchased this can opener . 
she likes that they are a wise investment that does not cost much . 
num_num stars because they are well built headphones . 
i read numerous reviews before i decided to give this one a shot . 
it has a very nice weight and quality feel to it . 
this pan is from denmark and holds up to our most demanding criteria . 
this is a good investment if you are starting your kitchen up . 
that would mean a waste of money and time !  . 
i live in an incredibly dusty part of the world . 
i was also pleasantly surprised that it charges my iphone num_extend
these extra blades i bought for my new food processor are really nice . 
the price was outstanding and shipping was free .  .  .  . mike . 
the ony draw back to this product is that it is corded . 
very nicely made scoop ,  just watch your size . 
the grill did an excellent job with chicken ,  steaks ,  and bratwurst . 
it has recently been returned to see about the warranty on it . 
western style long grain rice works well too . 
it grabs hold of the dough and turns it fine . 
and yes ,  the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance . 
the lock makes the tongs easy to usec . 
it works very well and has easy setup and controls . 
i bought two other cases but had to jam the iphone in . 
even great for large everyday stock pot dishes like stews and soups !  . 
works without adhesive and protects against almost anything . 
there is not anything i don t like about this charger . 
the seller called me directly and the shipping was really fast . 
i was so happy that i was able to get it for him . 
they are a little too bright ,  and not really all that useful . 
the ones i purchased were not cheap had come highly recommended . 
works !  a great way to make healthier popcorn . 
my other braun did not have this problem . 
go ahead and add the ground coffee to the num_extend
the holster is sturdy and holds the phone well . 
these are beautiful large glasses ,  perfect for reds . 
this iced tea maker works well and as described . 
yet the chicken was very crispy and very juicy . 
i love this so much i had to get a second one . 
we will definitely buy this again in the future . 
it sounded good ,  but i just don t like doing that . 
not a lot of buttons or controls to mess with . 
milk seems to stay better and doesn t get that funky smell . 
like many users ,  i bought this grill with low expectations . 
i had one of these for my num_extend
the only thing is it is hard to get on and off . 
even though these clips are small ,  they are really sturdy . 
there have been some people who didn t like the newer revere cookware . 
i was impressed as soon as i opened the package on delivery . 
but thicker also means the phone is more protected . 
of course ,  this blade is exactly what it says it is . 
very handy to have on the kitchen counter . 
it is marble so it washes up easily . 
my daughter is very thankful and i liked the price . 
i leave it off ,  and flip it on when i need it . 
i washed them in the dishwasher and that worked well with no issues . 
reccommend it to anyone who cooks alot and needs the ease of digital . 
it was a replacement for my cell battery . 
never thought i would love a juicer so much . 
the stainless steel construction makes this a very sturdy and dependable utensil . 
this headset is a very comfortable over the ear design . 
this works as a dish washing tool holder for me . 
perfect size for the bulk tea i buy and very attractive . 
so i received my popper quickly and the packaging was great . 
it s worth the money and easy to refill . 
we bought it about num_num months ago and it runs num_num num_extend
i use this for online gaming and my kids appreciate it as well . 
i would honestly miss the case more than the phone . 
i use it at home and at work . 
the metal fittings common to other ka accesories . 
keep in mind ,  this unit brews water quickly through the grind . 
this item is great !  i love using it . 
it is now getting charged ,  and looks great . 
case arrived in a timely manner ,  happy with my purchase . 
this whisk is well balanced allowing for easy whisking . 
the waffles came out easily with a plastic fork . 
it holds my utensils well and it matches the rest of my fiestaware . 
i am soooo glad i decided to keep it . 
and does a good job !  it also keeps the popcorn much warmer . 
it fits in a small space that i wanted it in my office . 
well the nissan thermos does not have a tea strainer . 
i like it more than the plantronics and any sony earpiece ever made . 
it will be nice for cooking my sauce for my home canning . 
it s so beautiful ,  it works so seamlessly ,  it s awesome . 
this stovetop brewer is a great buy for num_num bucks . 
i highly recommend this product for these reasons . 
it is much lighter and fits much better than the num_extend
works perfectly on glass storage canisters with  approximately  num_extend inch opening . 
it works well for rice and is very well made . 
very well constructed and a must have if you like to dutch oven . 
keeps raw chicken gunk away from the ball . 
if you dont like it amazon will take it back . 
these flex much less ,  and in my opinion look much nicer . 
the glassware looks very much like the original lead crystal editions . 
however ,  one very important thing you should know . 
it didn t appear to be shipped from amazon but another company . 
i bought the plantronics headset and it has been excellent . 
this would be a great gift for anyone including the dorm student . 
contacts from facebook and other email accounts are seamlessly added to the phone num_extend
i bought both the num_num and the num_extend
just what i needed to make artisan bread . 
i just had my num_extend blender break down in about num_num years . 
that s how much i was impressed ! the design is awesome . 
i needed this for the aux port on my car stereo . 
it came when promised and it better than the picture . 
its sturdy and works well except for one thing . 
worked wonderfully and protected my bionic nicely for my lifestyle . 
no static or hissing either .  .  . they just cut out . 
this case is just beautiful !  the picture does it no justice . 
this makes carving turkey or and meat a breeze . 
seemed like it d be a neat trick if it would work . 
i am so surprised the device has not broken at this point . 
i can t seem to own enough of these spatulas . 
a bit more of a plastic feel than i expected . 
a few weeks after this incident the charge became intermittent . 
if you need a good fan ,  do not hesitate . 
i bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it . 
i ve used it for round bread too . highly recommended . 
i purchased this a num_extend time for my brother for christmas . 
great size and also doubles for several other uses in the kitchen . 
i own an original jawbone that is getting a little shopworn . 
plus ,  i don t want to give up my otter box protection . 
i buy fiesta because i know they will survive my num_num boys . 
this phone really does everything you d need a cell phone to do . 
after a year on my evo num_extend the oem battery was sucking . 
i liked this food processor so much that i purchased it twice . 
i cracked my prior taylor after using it for num_num years . 
they would also work just fine in a regular coffee maker . 
the second one went together and leaned to one side . 
thanks so so much !  i have said quite enough about it . 
it is a needed accessory for your cellphones . 
i keep my coffee beans and grounds in them . 
my bread turns out great every time with this mixer . 
i was in need of a scooper to make muffins and cupcakes with . 
me and other samsung solstice users have no issue with the battery charging . 
a minor nit :  the multicolor led it has is really miniscule . 
remembering to change the bag was difficult  and ultimately expensive  . 
for less than $ it s worth the money . 
be sure to use all the silicon glue they provide when gluing it . 
item was received same day as promised as well as new as promised . 
they are oem filters and are exactly what i wanted . 
this is the best food processor you can buy . 
in addition ,  the wire seem to be a bit thin . 
i would buy again if shipped by amazon . 
not bad once you get use to the heavy control switch . 
car dock works beautifully ,  and activates car mode . 
perfect !  ps these cups start widening at the top lip . 
amazon price is cheap and delivery is quick . 
i use this santoku for preparing sashimi and carpaccio . 
fits in with the rest of my set . 
after shipping this came to less tan $ num_extend
these stainless skewers work great for many uses and are dishwasher safe . 
i also like to bake cakes and cookies . 
it was actually lighter then what i expected . 
use the plastic tools to disconnect the num_num num_extend
couldn t find an num_extend springform in any store . 
for more complex functionality ,  there are several apps you can download . 
nice tight seal and in a very roomy vessel . 
i had one of these for num_num years and it finally stopped working . 
this is my num_extend htc evo num_extend extended battery . 
i then put the container in the fridge to cool . 
i someone would have thought of this sooner . 
i can haul a trash bag throughout the house with ease . 
it just didn t make powder out of my pills . 
the bag was soaked wet ,  as were the filters . 
the fit and finish of the product is excellent . 
i even bought other colors to change it up . 
it was nice to find a set with num_num petals . 
i bought this in num_num and its still going strong . 
call quality is good and voices sound num_extend
this is the best price for num_extend with two num_extend ports . 
but it s working out ok with this unit going . 
i have used it to melt chocolate in the microwave with no problems . 
it works pretty well ,  if i remember to use it . 
sitting at my best most of the day my feet freeze . 
i think they re a great deal for the price . 
it makes a racket ,  but is quieter than an impact machine . 
i would % purchase this item again from this seller . 
they both work well i prefer this lifter to the ergo model . 
it s cheap ,  especially compared to most iphone stands . 
i have num_num of them num_extend that are about num_num years old  . 
i probably used about num_num cup ,  because greek yogurt is really tart . 
the clock is great to and keeps very accurate time . linda . 
i like the easy use and easy clean . 
liquids can be a problem since the lid does not seal tightly . 
once installed ,  the headset immediately worked as docuemented . 
a booster cannot create a signal when there is none . 
i purchased these along with the starter set that comes with the pump . 
pros :  it is not a separate bulky machine to store . 
i had been searching high and low for this product . 
has a nice hefty feel and does the job . 
it s as loud as a hairdryer ,  so that s not bad . 
just follow the directions that come with the product . 
perfect for my small kitchen . can recommend without hesitation . 
arrived quickly despite where it was shipped from . 
it makes all the difference in the world . 
the ac adapter is oem but the cable i received was aftermarket . 
its the perfect size and just over all works great !  . 
very secure latches to secure the top to the base . 
it takes num_num min and num_num seconds to cook the popcorn this way . 
so when i first got married ,  i wanted stainless steel everything . 
never use a metal spatchela and season it with oil or butter . 
this carrying case was the perfect fit for my droid x . 
i put on the music on my ipod ,  and wow . 
has num_num sharp edges for ease in cutting cake ,  pie etc . 
i was she very excited about getting this noodle maker . 
i tried various cases on several different cell phones . 
one of these days i ll have her using it . 
additionally ,  the initial roughness of the cooking surface itself will smooth out . 
it holds alot per self and moves around with ease . 
they were packaged nicely and worked just as expected . 
the screen is smaller than the droidx ,  but at the same resolution . 
this skillet cooks the steak evenly throughout every part . 
coffee tea pots before and the basket always melted after lots of uses . 
it is very sturdy ,  well made ,  easy to hold . 
i would recommend this skin to those who want minimalistic protection . 
i have no doubt this will last me for quite awhile . 
i wanted a good set of stainless steel measuring spoons . 
also i havenot had any problem using them in a very hot oven . 
just keep an eye on it if you get these . 
i particularly like the locking mechanism on these tongs . 
we got the mixer for my older daughter . 
after i dropped my phone and cracked the glass face . 
this is the first time i have encountered this issue with a eureka . 
i am glad i decided to try it . 
we have not tried it to make pasta yet . 
i know i will never again trust a different press . 
it has magnets to hold the knives in a bit . 
it took more than num_num minutes to reach its final temperature . 
i like the way it looks and is simple to use . 
we had done our homework previously and read some pretty mixed reviews . 
many of the ones i looked at had glass tops . 
i use it all the time with no issues . 
i only have glass and corelle dishes and plates in my house . 
it is inset in the case and for me difficult to manage . 
i m not sure why this works ,  but it does . 
just make sure you follow all recommendations in the instructions . 
i now have a french press and it works fine for that also . 
i have always struggled trying to zest lemon ,  etc . 
the was priced very reasonably that is why i bought it . 
i needed to organize my spice drawer ,  these fit perfectly . 
a piece of where the case snaps on broke off . 
has not stretced like any sillicone case would . 
we found that we needed more circular containers so we bought this set . 
this is a good rubberized case for htc evo design num_extend
in this case ,  i had the completely opposite reaction . 
i bought this on the recommendation of cooks illustrated . 
i don t care where it s made ,  it works great . 
this is both a plus and a minus . 
anker has never let us down ,  definitely recommend . 
do not even waste your time or thought on any other waffle maker . 
this tool is ideal for whisking a loose batter ,  eggs ,  whatever . 
all in all ,  doing num_num apples took me about num_num minutes . 
he also found the pen to be more comfortable in his hand . 
this is awesome stylus for ipad ,  ipod ,  iphone devices . 
great phone case i used this case for about num_num years . 
the piece is very attractive and the quality of workmanship is very good . 
i wanted big canisters to store flour in . 
it was pretty straight forward to put on . 
don t forget to wash the filter twice a year  if not more  . 
was a little warm when it was done but it was ok . 
over all an awesome fix for little money ! thanks !  . 
num_num year old says my fries taste just like mcd s . 
i use mine every week for sunday dinner . 
the case is super protective and has the perfect hold for my galaxy num_extend
no more burning my hands when taking my food out of the microwave . 
i m thinking about ordering one for each of my daughters . 
the profiserie sitram line is easier and  softer  to handle . 
this is white ,  however ,  but still really cute . 
just give them a chance to make it right . 
bagels work really well ,  and you can use flavored ones . 
it looks like amazon has finally sorted out the problem . 
there was a minor problem with the color ,  but i contacted them . 
if you have a kitchenaid mixer ,  you should definitely buy this attachment . 
charge and pair them both and you ll have a spare . 
all the common measurements and a convenient key ring . 
this usb cable works great !  i have had no issues with it . 
the commandone can rest in whatever comfortable position you want and works fantastic . 
refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours . 
they create an ice block with an uneven surface at the bottom . 
if those aren t lined up right ,  it won t charge . 
it seems to work as well as my other cast iron one . 
but the definately wont float as there are two holes in them . 
listen carefully until there are like num_num seconds between pops . 
it is real hard to switch between the roadster and the jawbone . 
i use it more than any other pan i have . 
i lost this scoop after loaning it out . 
it covers a larger area and is very heavy which is an advantage . 
only drawback is it doesn t come with a lid . 
they rebranded the pack from a gtmax to evopower black num_extend
sound quality is good with simple voice narration from an audio book . 
i can now work in peace knowing he cant see anything . 
the speech recognition worked well for answering calls . 
this product has performed flawlessly in my travels . 
the sound is great and the microphone is effective . 
i used it myself once when my phone was low . 
also ,  the shelf is not attached to the rest of the rack . 
this case fit perfectly and is very durable . 
i bought a taylor meat thermometer years ago when i first got married . 
people barely know i am on a mobile phone . 
i purchased two chrome covered plastic double tier lazy susans . 
everything works well and the only problem i had was with the headphones . 
this little bissell does just what it s designed to do . 
perhaps jumbo or extra large eggs would cook with the recommended water levels . 
the price is incredible for this kind of case . 
it is easy to store and good enough looking to be left out . 
i would defer purchasing this product until the reviews turn positive again . 
the enclosed system allows fast ,  high temperature cooking without heating up your num_extend
i use this to charge my ipod and phone . 
that s about right for any coffee maker in this price range . 
it saves time and is easy to clean . 
if you follow the instructions to a tee you should be ok . 
i don t think i d use it for fat hot dogs though . 
they are great if you make your own popsicles . 
it gives substance to such a small phone . 
it s not a pain to fold it off for charging . 
the problem is ,  the stoneware heats before the food . 
it was exactly what i was looking for . 
you can reach it ,  but it s not always easy . 
they said that those noises are loud and unbearable . 
using a decent grinder like a capresso infinity or better is worthwhile . 
after about num_num weeks of use it s perfect . 
well done all clad for all your fantastic products !  . 
i had been using a balloon whisk and thought it was fine . 
i hope to use this for some real nice occasion . 
measurement markings do not fade over time ,  even with vigorous use !  . 
it s easy to install and is super clear and durable . 
they lasted anywhere from num_num years to num_num months  bodum  . 
i think these are really impressive when entertaining . 
however there is a price for that great coffee . 
this must be simplest little gadget out there . 
for a single limes i still use a hardwood reamer though . 
others snag or loose there shape and pinch my arm . 
these are great curtain rings and really look nice in my bathroom . 
it is a great size for a bowl . 
just wanted to warn you about the price . 
a decent plain mattress pad is half the cost of this . 
 the rug changes color .  . tho it is a mixed hue med . 
works well for popcorn and that s what i bought it for . 
the lighted indicator ring isn t obtrusive ,  even while driving at night . 
next thing to get are the pasta attachments . 
never any freezer burn ,  and product comes out fresh . 
any safety pin would remove your sim card . 
the design works well for easily mashing potatoes . 
those ones are dangerous and are not ul approved !  . 
purchased these for my sister ,  who has an iphone num_num  sprint  . 
the num_num blue buttons let you know the percent charge left . 
so it was a great deal and a great value . 
i have devised a test to demonstrate this level of grip . 
neither were fruits ,  meats ,  ice cream ,  or ice . 
they were a big hit !  great for small details . 
my only issue with this headset is the fit in my ear . 
i also use it to keep my ipad clean when using online recipes . 
i will attempt trying to make a crust after the new year . 
this was everything it said it would be . 
however ,  sonix snap slim case is just like what it says . 
we also love that you can see how much coffee is left . 
the phone is rugged and can hold up to use !  great buy . 
it has become the mac and cheese bowl at our house . 
it is a large mug ,  a bit wider than it is tall . 
i would recommend this to anyone that likes fresh squeezed juice . 
it stays in my ears ,  and is made well . 
there is nothing  mini  about the operation either . 
yup ,  in a word ,  it s the perfect vacation phone . 
been using this headphone set for a while . 
but it !  with prime you ll have it in num_num days . 
this is simply a must buy accessory for a must have item . 
this is my second one because i wore out my first one . 
the bow makes it difficult to put light weight food along the edges . 
this product was made in china , if that makes a difference . 
if they fail i ll update my review . highly recommend !  . 
i really like the nice blue glow from the ring . 
i can measure all my liquids in one dish . 
beats buying another case and now no watermarks to deal with . 
its pyrex brand so you know its good . 
you might be hesitant to use glassware for everyday food storage . 
fat from the dogs just drip down to a removable tray . 
however it arrived in a timely manner and there were no surprises . 
i have num_num sets and gave num_num sets as christmas gifts . 
the quality of the wood and finish is good . 
the coverage is good to protect my clothes . 
i have decided that is not a deal breaker . 
it basically does what it s described to do . 
the bowls are a little on the small side ,  but usable . 
i prefer the larger round handles ,  both functional and beautiful . 
we ve made this a company standard for all iphone s . 
holes in the proper location for the camera and sensor . 
they even have pedigrees but for bread this works great pound cake too . 
the dehydrator still did the job and the extra trays worked just fine . 
for this price ,  i could not be more pleased . 
everything is original though ,  the wire and the plug in unit . 
i used a mr coffee maker a few years back . 
the rubber is of good quality and did not disintegrate even a bit . 
it is amazing !  i recommend this for any cook !  . 
this case was so convenient and also looks great . 
though ,  i actually prefer this one for my small and sensitive ears . 
my wife thinks i am nuts but brings back some good memories . 
with this headset all the buttons work perfectly . 
due to frequent travel ,  my iphone get drained out . 
the computer usage is designed to be paired with skype or google voice . 
you can stii use the phone but it s fully protected from falling . 
i bought one of these november num_num and it is still working fine . 
helps to keep some of the cigarette smoke from annoying me . 
an invaluable island tool !  easy to use and clean . 
it had no problems pairing with the headphones or with a jawbone jambox . 
other than that it works well and seems to be quite durable . 
we looked at several models and of course read the reviews on them . 
it is very well made and should last a lifetime . 
this product is far more sturdy with better design . 
if that happens ,  i will update the review . 
switching between music and phone function is simple . 
only down fall is not that visible in sunlight . 
when the little light turns green ,  you are all good . 
no bubbles ,  no complicated adhesives ,  no dust ,  perfect fit . 
bypassing the restrictions on how you can interact with os is called rooting . 
it comes seasoned  as described  ,  which is critical . 
was delivered several days early for my tracfone num_extend
still an incredible deal considering the stores get num_num bucks for these things . 
nothing fancy ,  it just does what it s supposed to do . 
the kettle is still in great shape with no issues whatsoever . 
i use the larger size also for zucchini and squash for dipping . 
the included cleaning tool makes getting strands out of the holes a snap . 
it was always a joy to see the difference the ole steamvac made . 
just add a tad of water and a couple splenda packets . 
i good some collards in this and it works just fine . 
this product is easy and seems to work well . 
i highly recommend this product ,  especially with the awesome price . 
definitely watch the dvd that comes with the food processor . 
just recently received my presto num_num qt stainless pressure cooker . 
it work good the only think in num_num month it broke . 
for num_num bucks this case cant be beat . 
pretty amazing to have that kind of warranty and service these days . 
i purchased this to assist me in making my homemade soaps . 
i ll be getting the other pieces as well . 
i received these bumpers way before the expected date . 
all the health food books reccomend it as a requirement for health . 
the only complaint i have with this rolling pin is the price . 
it just feels nice against the hand and a nice grip . 
i keep this with the baking supplies and it is always there . 
had he read directions first it probably would have taken num_num minutes . 
the bottoms of all pans have shiny metal . 
product is comparable to higher end glass screen protectors . 
it was easy to install and hold all my knives conveniently . 
love ,  love ,  love and so does the gift recipient !  . 
i bought this for my sister and she loooooves this . 
and quite frankly ,  $ is excessive for a usb charger . 
these you physically have to push in and they feel a bit num_extend
this is a standard num_extend broiler pan that i also use for roasting . 
i d give five stars if it didn t cost so much . 
this is the third car mount i have tried . 
i cannot see how you could go wrong . 
just expect to spend a little extra time and effort on the cleaning . 
heavy as all get out ,  but that s what i wanted . 
the stitching on my pouch is not white ,  it s black . 
the basket and the lid are dishwasher safe . great deal . 
it just looked like fun to do with kids watching . 
i noticed grains on images of larger size . 
burgers were cooked well with nice sear marks . 
i had a dickens of a time finding this color accessory in stores . 
i like to use it for scrambled eggs . 
not much to say about a cable like this . 
this cover fits well over the body pillow i bought . 
great variety ,  but none of them are very large . 
but it only happened about once every half hour or so . 
i highly recommend this filter to everyone who s water is compromised . 
this is what real fruit juice looks like . 
i wanted it for my travel trailer and space is an issue . 
i have owned iphone num_extend for num_num years and used several screen protectors . 
the affordance  variety of hand positions that feel good  is wonderful . 
but you buy it for the cooking and it is excellent at that . 
so they re definitely there the next time around . 
these tongs have what i have found to be usual oxo great quality . 
i never used a power attachment like the pasta maker or meat grinder . 
the lid ,  the shape ,  the height ,  it all works . 
cooking inside leaves a lingering smell that i do not enjoy . 
other than that ,  what more can i say . 
if you order one ,  don t let the light weight fool you . 
for them it was a real difficulty getting the repair . 
the ones at the supermarket are cheap and junky . 
i am more than pleased with the charger . 
here s a tip :  you don t want to overfill the rings . 
for a little over $ i can find no faults with this charger . 
i too have trouble getting the ice cream frozen in this attachment . 
i make sure to never leave the kitchen with it plugged in . 
it s very easy to use and flavor isn t sacrificed . 
to do over again i would buy one double this size . 
the come in all shapes and sizes and colors . 
so glad the convert turned me on to this manufacturer !  . 
i bought burner covers from another vendor last year and was very disappointed . 
i love coffee and for years have been burning out electric coffee makers . 
to be fair ,  the aliph jawbone also has drawbacks . 
used this to fix my screen on my galaxy num_extend
does the job of keeping my pots up and out of the way . 
this appears to be at random ,  but it just irks me . 
i use this at work to charge my ipod . 
so it is fifteen inches from outer lip to outer lip . 
and this baby puts out some great yogurt . 
so far it has been a great addition to my studio apt . 
it can also be used like a mini dutch oven . 
it makes quick ,  great coffee ,  and cleanup takes num_num seconds . 
good heavy pan ,  heats well and is great for breakfast . 
he also likes that the temperature of the warmer plate is adjustable . 
we cut up a dozen potatoes in about a minute . 
the directions say to line it with a paper towel or newspaper . 
good product that was made with pride in chine by dedicated people . 
i ve been using this cable for about a month . 
so i could make a long loaf shape . 
using moderate heat ,  nylon tools will last many years . 
the picture of this item is not same as item received . 
no need to put the juicer through the dishwasher . 
that monolith was a chore to clean for juice . 
i rarely used anyway it because it was complicated and hard to clean . 
less bulky than an otter box !  fast delivery . 
it is very well made and love the handle grips . 
i m not usually a fan of kitchen gadgets . 
i got a good for this from $
i have not been very happy with the battery life of my iphone num_extend
i purchased this press to make the fresh juice for my water jug . 
you know you can t have enough of a good thing . 
it is as i expected and now the other has a partner . 
i received this case first and immd started using it . 
but i used the runner from this one and it fits perfectly . 
a great product even though made in china . 
i use a motorola razr m and previously a droid x . 
you need steady hands but i nailed it my first try . 
i got this case because everyone in my family has an iphone . 
the picture on amazon is a better match . 
while it does fit without a phone case ,  it s tight . 
we freeze the juice for uses all year long . 
love this for taming the clutter under the bathroom or kitchen sink . 
one of my neighbors installed it for me because i am disabled . 
i bought this size and the num_num inch square . 
this is definitely the case you may actually seriously want to get . 
this case has a hard shell and then a rubber outside case . 
the sticker on the bottom is quite wicked to get off . 
install was very easy ,  just peel back off and place on screen . 
i purchased this from amazon . com ,  over a month ago . 
the best part of this is the thermostat gauge . 
this newer model seems to be better actually . 
good volume and an even eq balance between bass and treble . 
i purchased this skillet recently and was impressed with its design and heft . 
it would work more quickly to grind a single serving amount . 
this tablecloth is just beautiful and washes like a dream . 
this refers to the volume buttons on top of the unit . 
the bowls are perfect for cereal ,  soup or salad . 
i have been using these for several months and they are fabulous . 
keep your batteries in a dry ,  cool place and away from moisture . 
you pay a little more but it was sure worth the price . 
however ,  it is difficult to set up properly . 
i m trusting that this will work as well as my older one . 
this is my first and only food chopper and it works great . 
buy the brabantia silicone grey cover to go over this felt . 
gave my num_num year old son this case . 
went with the delonghi num_extend this time ,  about $ cheaper . 
bought two of these and am pleased with the heavy construction . 
i ve inspected both blenders and cannot find one blemish on them . 
i got this for when i do webex sessions . 
technology has come a long way in that time . 
very nice trivets ,  extremely pleased with this purchase . 
they leave a mark or rust stain on the num_extend
it charges quickly and faster than my kingston rapid charger . 
and frankly it just looks and feels nice . 
i would be remis ,  however ,  if i didnt share a story . 
no more teabags here ,  i ll just use this . 
i have num_num of them and each one is working perfectly . 
no problems ,  easy to use ,  easy to clean . 
not audiophile type headphones but for what they are they work very well . 
i would buy this again and personalize it with bling . 
this cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now . 
i have had this for several months now and used countless times . 
i have used the gingerbread boy and the holly the most . 
apparently ,  it doesn t strip the oil as do paper filters . 
this is the steel that i keep in my kit . 
my wife and i are both avid cooks . 
i have several sets and use them often for fragrant fajitas . 
then i found these and i snatched them up . 
be aware of its weight !   i know ,  i know . 
as most of the time the order was filled properly and packaged well . 
but that is also what keeps you from losing it . 
rather than carry multiple cords around we use these splitters . 
like new and saved alot of money !  sounds fantastic !  . 
i thought i would miss the physical buttons ,  but i don t . 
this size rice cooker is not too big for you . 
i m right handed and peel towards myself so this is perfect . 
greek yogurt has already lost a lot of the whey via sieving . 
it was a good deal for the price . 
i bought this to replace my home water delivery . 
this pot could be easily $ more and still a bargain . 
does well on medium hard cheeses like cheddar . 
had this for about num_num months now and it still works perfectly . 
i really like them and would recommend them over plastic . 
cant go anywhere without a backup charger ,  especially in my car . 
great case with solid protection coverage over all sides and back of iphone . 
i have never had a a bad loaf of bread . 
they clean up easily and store up against the backsplash on my counter . 
has only some slight staining from my cheese powders and seasonings . 
great if you re replacing your old plastic containers . 
they cut well and are easy to clean . 
i can t think of a single flaw in this device . 
i would rate this a great bluetooth and recommend it to others . 
it works great to mist food so spices stick for grilling . 
it is large enough to fit two good sized spoons . 
cloggingsomeone in another review mentioned that their filter started to clog . 
these are well constructed and keep liquids piping hot for hours . 
i have young kids and it can be knocked over . 
they re the perfect fit for my num_num cup coffee maker . 
the product is built solidly ,  and really does keep drinks well insulated . 
but so far no problems and it s doing its job . 
keep in my pack when out fishing or hunting . 
i use it all the time and charges very good . 
we have purchased num_num more for use by others in our institution . 
i gave this popper to them ,  since theirs is soooo old . 
received num_num of these about a week ago . 
the larger cup can also be used to cut up herbs with scissors . 
it takes num_num minutes for raw vegetables to get well done . 
proctor silex makes good quality appliances at a reasonable price . 
it includes an adapter so the you can charge a galaxy tab . 
hardly any of my towels match because i try different brands . 
high quality in every way and i am so happy with my purchase . 
i liked it the case was hard putting on . 
had no problems with it what s so ever sincerely kay trammell . 
the battery lasts me for a whole day meaning from num_extend to num_extend
i am so glad that i could find it online . 
you end up pulling the machine over when vacuuming the crown molding etc . 
they have become very helpful in my kitchen . 
not sure why other reviews are tying to hang bigger objects . 
plastic holds up to hot gravy and fat separator works . 
but that s just me being lazy instead of reflection of the product . 
which means it s probably worth the extra money . 
i also own one of these taylors ,  and have for several years . 
many people don t understand the importance of having high quality cooking knives . 
got them cheap hear instead of hunting around in a store for them . 
i have had it for more years than i can think of . 
very easy to use ,  gets the job done quickly . 
if you have a galaxy num_extend or num_extend i would recommend it . 
iphone has a num_extend screen and evo has a num_extend screen . 
i have been using this whisk for over num_num years and love it . 
primarily on the inside of the bowl itself . 
they seem to really want you to be happy with your purchase . 
i really love these bowls and how functional they are . 
so if your recipe doesn t work at first ,  try another . 
gelatin cannot be strained ,  so read the list of ingredients . 
i couldn t find the popper anywhere in town . 
finally ,  it completed my collection of accesories for my food processor . 
i wish the  cookie sheet  was a bit larger ,  though . 
only thing is ,  it s a bit tricky to clean . 
the second page lists the product specs and box contents . 
i avoided getting a smart phone for a long time . 
nice heat retention of even heat from iron . 
i put num_num small to regular sized cloves in and press . 
it is made cheap and the hinges on the lid could be improved . 
i highly recommend for the protection of your phone . 
this accessory kit supports the wilson signal booster very well . 
however ,  you are not able to see where the missing ones are . 
he still uses them on a daily basis and loves them . 
this pan has been used everyday in my kitchen for nearly seven years . 
my wife just doesn t like to wash it . 
the four shelves can be placed to suit your needs . 
everything is still good with them and i enjoy them . 
i have nothing to complain about this stuff so far . 
the emergency battery charger for my ipod is a great idea . 
i ordered this as a gift for my sister . 
this is one of the best canners i have ever used . 
i read the reviews and decided to go for it . 
one of my kids is very clumsy and drops things all the time . 
this is by far the best deal on a closet ladder . 
i have used the palm iii ,  treo ,  blackberry ect . 
doesn t happen all the time but is a bother when it does . 
the description doesn t say it does ,  but it does . 
the serrated blade gives you the edge when you need it . 
the video is an excellent way for newbies to learn its quirks . 
this is plenty of time to clean up the areas i need . 
i think most people will be happy with this for their phone . 
i have to fold the pressed seams under and then mash it in . 
these canisters really set off my red themed kitchen . 
i found the tea and coffee pods delicious . 
i leave it in the oven to help regulate the temp . 
it pairs flawlessly and connects to both devices regularly . 
i hate all the new spoons ,  etc with large handles . 
the sleeve is a very tight fit for my slender steak knife blades . 
we use one for coffee and the new one for spices . 
it doesnt get tangled i guess that is that the flat design . 
i was going to throw them out when i saw these gaskets available . 
they were easy to install in my slider windows . 
my dehydrator is the one with the motor on top . 
works well ,  i do think it protects my iphone . 
the inner lid is removable and cleaning it is also a breeze . 
i use this frequently and haven t been disappointed yet . 
never use scrubbers and always dry after washing for spotless look . 
a really nice feature when typing on the touch screen is autocomplete . 
i use the belt clip while at work and it has performed flawlessly . 
the is the best speaker i have used tet . 
i highly recommend these over any other scissors out there . 
bad enough that we run it through plastic in the coffee machine . 
this one although adequate would not be my first choice . 
on one side is english and the other side is metric . 
i was very impressed with how solid and sturdy these stands are . 
make ironing easier and no waffle marks in clothes . 
they have perfect weight  i hate lightweight cookwares  and durable . 
this is just right for our two person family . 
my wife and i decided we wanted to make our own pasta . 
no clamshell or unnecessary plastics to cut open and dispose of . 
this design looks like it will hold up real well . 
i love the way it reduces glare and protects from smearing . 
first i removed the trash can and can brace from the mounting bracket . 
which do a fairly good job . this grill is different . 
num_extend implementation on the phone is far from ideal . 
it does help with marinating ,  but only up to a point . 
study for phone and pretty well for cheap and light num_num inch tablet . 
the precise times in the recipe book are a big help . 
it charges both iphones and ipads simultaneously with no issue . 
it distributes heat well and cleans off without too much fuss . 
they are large and they bake the cookies perfectly . 
this is a great set of five dif colored thin plastic cutting boards . 
this took care of providing a  cushioned  surface  a complaint another reviewer raised  . 
i put the sugar in this container loose . 
only cast iron actually benefits from frequent use . 
it is rugged and has a weighty quality . 
first thing i made yesterday was candied sweet potatoes . 
my husband vacuum seals our wine bottles using these stoppers . 
it has held up fantastically ,  a very well engineered product . 
looks like a good way to keep the heat outside . 
they work equally well so it s just your personal preference . 
the stainless steel is a must for a busy baker . 
to me this is not an invonvenience . lcd digital clock . 
then i wouldn t know how good this simple press is . 
it simply glides on the potato and removes the skin . 
he had one that was like this and somehow it was lost . 
they are little discolored but nobody will no because they will be hidden . 
we have always had great luck with whatever they recommend . 
i like that there are num_num different sizes . 
this cleaner is awesome !  quiet ,  powerful ,  great storage of attachments . 
it could be larger  like num_extend cubic feet  but works great for me . 
i plug this in my saddle bag with num_num devices . 
it is so much easier to use than a hand mixer . 
it s been very useful and worth the price . 
other than that there is nothing of better value than this product . 
i have an iphone num_extend that fits perfectly inside . 
no complaints from others about hearing me speak . 
it fits neatly in my car for easy use . 
these are great knives ,  and they need exceptional care to last . 
that pretty much cuts out most of the salty snack category of life . 
also ,  although it is small it will hold quite a few veggies . 
it performs as good as any other all clad  i have one  . 
the price on this was great it works like a charm . 
the cover interferes with this ,  so it had to go . 
i hope to purchase another set in the future . 
when compared to my photon led keychain ,  it is not as bright . 
i wish i had num_num of these things . 
i previously owned the first version of the new trent external battery . 
i highly recommend them and plan to buy several sets for family members . 
this little microwave pot does it exactly right . 
does what it is supposed to do charge the phone . 
it s nice to have a choice of sizes . 
we make a lot of pasta at our house . 
the itouch is perfect for me since i travel and do presentations . 
is just like putting on the oven racks . 
i bought these just to have on hand . 
next before i use the pans i lightly oil the surface . 
because the motor is not attached and won t get wet when cleaning . 
shipping takes awhile ,  so if you need something quickly ,  look elsewhere . 
makes a world of difference in the coffee maker . 
in one hour my iphone was over % charged . 
the battery fit well ,  and has worked well . 
i m told the microphone quality is clear with proper volume . 
it is solid and will last a long time . 
this is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets . 
they may not be bose ,  but they fit my purpose fine . 
this wok s greatest feature is the detachable bowl . 
low num_extend results in incomcombustion which results in higher levels of co . 
nothing flashy ,  no gadgetry ,  just a tried and true cooking tool . 
these light weight headphones are exactly what i was looking for . 
she always wants the same electronics i buy . 
they work fine but this upgrade is a much improved set . 
i read the reviews and decided on this cuisinart . 
i loved and swore by the speck products with the gel in them . 
they are high quality and a good size . 
shipping seemed like i got it the next day . 
our lattes are two double shots plus milk . 
this is a good sounding headset with great background noise blocking . 
the product was delivered in good condition and on time . 
they look beautiful but are sturdy enough for every day use . 
i had previously been a le creuset person . 
other than the nicks ,  they look like perfect condition . 
even in the small bathroom ,  the central heating drowns it out . 
even if made strong it will still be smooth . 
if you like linzer cookies ,  this is a good set to have . 
followed the instructions and had everything done within three minutes . 
i received it free while ordering another product . 
this thermos keeps the coffee fresh ,  and hot for hours . 
it was done in less than an hour . 
they still work great ,  but are no longer shiny . 
the surface is good and won t stick like the cheaper pans . 
i took all my good knives in last year and was amazed . 
i tried once ,  and it was hurting my ears . 
the fryer is easy to clean and produces top quality results . 
i think it is well woth money spent . 
once i got help ,  we had no problem . 
overall i think this is a great peeler . 
not obnoxious and adds a little bit of light near the power supply . 
one thing that i really like about this mount is the release button . 
i wanted a num_num qt stock pot and i like using this one . 
not a lot ,  but there will be some . 
thank you for providing an inexpensive quality product . 
no problem i have plenty and all i really needed was the headset . 
it does not add a lot of bulk to the phone . 
whee i younger and stronger ,  that would not be a problem . 
i should mention we grind our beans ,  and we purchase ground coffee . 
i bough this model at costco num_num years ago for $
you can look at that problem as a possitive and negative . 
ka has slipped in quality over the last several years . 
so only having to charge them about once a week is great . 
get one made by motorola and not a cheap brand made in china . 
wide enough to flip thin pancakes or fried eggs with ease . 
these are the cheapest ,  best designed and sturdiest corn holders out there . 
i would rather have had it use the standard mini usb tip . 
i love tigers so it is something that i always enjoy looking at . 
you can safely set it on the stove for even heat . 
the blade is also wider than my other chef knives . 
the seller shipped quickly ,  and item was exactly as described . 
it fall to the floor countless times but could not survie the pool . 
so light ,  you can wear it for hours w . o . 
he bought me this cast iron pizza pan from logic  off amazon prime  . 
this charges ipad num_num fine in the car . 
i don t ever want to use regular screen protectors again . 
it vacuums just as well as the old one and is lots quieter . 
i was not expecting much at all for the price i paid . 
i seasoned it first and have no problems with rusting . 
also ,  did i mention i love the design ?  !  ?  . 
we are so amazed and glad for this system !  . 
all of these bowls stack together very nicely too . 
and march each year .  con : always price with these things . 
this is nice and slim and fits in small spaces . 
the cable unplug and fits right inside for travel . 
works just like it s supposed to for the wife s iphone num_extend
make your next asian meal a little more authentic !  . 
as the other reviewers shared ,  this is perfect for the rowenta iron . 
having num_num usb plugs for a single wall socket is nice . 
i recently used it for the first time to cook our num_num lb . 
i can say that i order them from amazon a lot . 
the touch ui probably has a lot to do with this . 
this bowl is a nice addition to the standard mixer bowl . 
sure it s expencive but you do get what you pay for . 
if only i could find more cookware like this . 
the clips hold really well ,  the hook has a locking mechanism . 
i ve never damaged a glass carafe from  boiling  it dry . 
also ,  they say num_num cups; i say more like num_extend
i was on a mission to replace it . 
none of these are highly visible ,  especially when the jars are filled . 
glad i didn t spend any  real  money on this case . 
we installed this with no problems with bubbles or lint . 
recieved the item fast and it was packaged well . 
this item was received in timely fashion and in perfect condition . 
the price is right ,  however ,  for a backup case . 
but it operates smoothly and without any issues . 
i mean everyone have these four types of cases . 
use it instead of a broomfor quick clean ups . 
it finally went out and i am getting exactly the same one again . 
we use the num_num quart lodge chicken fryer . 
i see a lot of reviews where people order the wrong part . 
what can i say ?  ?  they fit the bunn . 
it works very well and gives on big chunk of cored pineapple . 
the stockpot comes well packaged ,  and it feels fairly substantial . 
but this one absolutely was an excellent buy . 
had them just over a week ,  very happy . 
i am very pleased with the look and design of this set . 
this charger set works great for the phone it is designed for . 
the rubber on the handle also makes it easy to use . 
i hope it lasts for a long time . 
i was desperate ,  but i was also tired of feeling drugged . 
just turn it on , activate you phones bluetooth and away you go . 
shipping was fast and item was rcvd as described . 
i can browse the internet and clearly read the web pages . 
i like this one a lot better because of the size of it . 
it has a great handle and is dishwasher safe . 
i only have to charge this every few days . 
i use a lot of garlic and all of it is in cloves . 
they shipped them to use pretty quickly as well . 
the whole thing comes apart and it washes very fast . 
this is a great product and it has very versatile uses . 
i ll be sure and update if there are any problems . 
i use it to vacuum the hardwood stairs in my home . 
maybe people don t like spending so much for a vacuum . 
i have found that i really like this soap dispenser . 
it opens any size can i give it . 
product is shipped in bubble wrap bag and not damaged in shipping . 
this thing works great for keeping my iphone charged while on my bicycle . 
i also think they are great for casual table service . 
this hoover works great feels sturdy and worth the money . 
as long as you remember that you will love it . 
designed so well it does not slide around in the cabinet . 
a wonderful ,  comfortable ,  and well balanced rubberized handle . 
i have a droid bionic and really like it . 
blade comes out easily with a coin or something similar . 
it does fine with normal walking around and light activity . 
all in all this is a great buy . 
this little gizmo has totally solved that problem . 
one of those odd little purchases that is indispensable in my kitchen . 
when not in your ears ,  these things pop off all the time . 
i think it looks even better in person than in the picture . 
during shipping a small piece on the door broke . 
she uses it a lot and really loves it . 
amazon is pretty great to return an item through . 
i will keep playing with it and post back on this num_extend
i am very pleased with the case that i got . 
it s not the nicest bookshelf but it definitely serves its purpose !  . 
it will serve as a large casserole for pot luck etc . 
and you can control what ingredients are in the stuff !  . 
i had forgotten how good percolated coffee tastes . 
this vic firth unit is the best i have ever used . 
pyrex is great and very versatile for cooking and storage . 
 i updated this post after about a month of use  . 
protection is a must for your phone screen . 
i bought it for my friend since she loves animals . 
for the price that you pay for these ,  the quality is amazing . 
if you need to skin fish ,  you have to get this knife . 
this is a ncie little cutter and works exactly as it should . 
need a teaspoon ?  turn the dial num_num times . 
i clean the grinder after every num_num lb or so . 
it powers ipad num_num with no problems on its num_extend num_extend
by just picking it up you get the impression of heavy duty quality . 
so it s very portable and easily fits in a bag . 
i loved them other then they crack really easy . 
please comment to this review if you think this could be it . 
over all ,  it makes for less work in the kitchen . 
ok ,  you have a decently wide ,  stable base . 
oster has its issues elsewhere too ,  so nothing is perfect . 
very convienent to have multiple chargers throughout the house . 
works good and seems accurate and easy to store . 
this is the perfect size for just about anything . 
be careful when you squeeze the clip to put it on . 
so you have this need to cook men . 
i pull it out a couple inches and call it a num_extend
it has num_num speeds and the highest one is very noisy . 
it makes great french fries and is a helpful onion cutter . 
this is the last one for quick pickups i m going to need . 
so we are able to distingues the different phones . 
at least that part is a lot easier to clean . 
only negative aspect to this is that there is no storage case . 
it goes from perfect to slightly burned very quickly . 
went outside for like num_num minutes ,  came back in . 
i think its just eh way it was designed . 
this num_extend inch size is perfect for small portions for one person . 
it looks great and cooks evenly with no hot spots; cleanup is easy . 
works great at making the perfect size cookies . 
these bags are the perfect size to freeze individual amounts . 
the handles are not hot when the rest of the pot is hot . 
i hope to be purchasing more case in different colors . 
all in all ,  it does what it is supposed to . 
but these filters do a lot for the price . 
i was disappointed places i ve lived weren t there . 
it does the job of keeping food from sticking ,  and being washable . 
great to have bananas and other fruits all in one place . 
however ,  you can t charge your phone ,  while its plugged in . 
the anker astro num_num is a very versatile charger . 
it covers the whole phone so that s an plus for me . 
it works well ,  has a light on it . 
box is very high quality and elegant look . 
especially getting that extra dirt off of potatoes . 
it will not fail you and the company has an excellent warrantee . 
i water tested the case alone before i bought this . 
nice little holder for things and such though !  . 
recommended !  it saved my phone from many large scratches . 
i never did find a humidifier that all reviewers gave a thumbs up . 
all he did was talk about the features it had . 
i even use that when i m grating something on my regular grater . 
keeps his phone clean and he can hold on to it well . 
never argue with a woman with a knife in her hand . 
the only downside is they must be well oiled . 
you don t even know it s pink unless your looking at it . 
i didn t want to set up a filter with my sink . 
i have used vick vaporizers for several years . 
my last case cracked when hiking in the cold . 
not much can really go wrong with this pan . 
google goggles :  take a picture and do the search on the num_extend
the unit brews very quickly and produces a smooth full bodied brew . 
no bells or whistles ,  just a good basic griddle . 
this is a well built device ,  that will make lots of waffles . 
it is easy to operate and easy to read . 
i had all of my spices sitting on the top of my stove . 
i have read numerous reviews on this toaster oven on   .  .  .   . 
i also use it for meat temp checking when roasting ,  etc . 
we have bought num_num pairs of these ear buds . 
i am very happy with the timely delivery and ease of set up . 
i do encourage regular cleaning which takes me about ten minutes per fan . 
this is very convenient and has worked perfectly for me for months . 
i d buy it again for sure if needed . 
i have not have any difficult with it yet . 
i recently used two of the plug on a trip . 
the less tear the better to extract it in one piece . 
we mostly use them for storing and reheating leftovers . 
and quite honestly ,  my palms have never been cleaner . 
love the handles as they feel ergonomically comfortable in your hands . 
they were happy to send a replacement and paid for return shipping even . 
long range ?  i don t know ,  but we ll see . 
it shut off about an hour later because it was charged . 
i have made at least num_num loaves of bread in this now . 
since purchase ,  i have used this machine about a dozen times . 
the color is as described and fits the kitchen aid perfectly . 
it s on a white textured fridge ,  and works just fine . 
not on the floor or in the corner . 
as with all lodge products ,  i highly recommend them . 
the good grips handle makes it very easy to hold . 
there is no better mug on the market . 
also ,  no damage to your dashboard with glues or sticky tapes . 
charges perfectly and is really well made and handy . 
it really does a good job of coring with minimal effort . 
if the cord was retractable this would be the ultimate . 
however ,  with new bags ,  this little bugger does the trick . 
i have had this item for many years . 
this kettle  purchased through amazon  was much better . 
this is typical oxo good grips quality product . 
this is very well built and very durable . 
now i don t have a lot of unpopped kernals left . 
received this product expecting terrible quality for the price but was surprised . 
we don t plan on ever buying bread again . 
i give this five stars because it works exactly the way it should . 
we keep these in our utensil drawer for general kitchen use . 
i received this with a broken black corner piece . 
we have had this cover for a while now . 
if and only if you follow the directions perfectly . 
they keep the coffee warm without it getting stronger and stronger . 
it works just fine ,  althhough it takes a little getting used to . 
these measuring cups are very sturdy and heavy duty . 
from the reviews i have read it offers superior wind noise reduction also . 
i would recomend this to everyone who is thinking of buying them . 
seems odd to me ,  but it gives another mounting option . 
i have used many times and it works well . 
it s thin ,  but seems to absorb a lot of water . 
so thanks to amazon for a great product and a very quick shippment . 
i really thought that it would voice command but it doesn t . 
the blades are extremely sharp ,  but the safey guard protects your fingers . 
this is a wonderful addition to have in my kitchen . 
not only is this a great deal but they work great . 
i like the little stand too ,  it makes storage easier . 
it is so easy to make a batch of perfectly popped corn . 
these knives are wonderful :  beautifully made and highly functional . 
the fit is not tight but that works just fine for me . 
i have used two of these for about num_num yrs now . 
 : pthis immersion blender rocks for a few reasons . 
i use this in my kid s closet with storage bins for clothes . 
that cookware was of very poor quality overall . 
the best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan . 
i look forward to many more lazy ,  sunday morning waffles . 
also use it for cutting foam for cushions . 
i definitely recommend it for it s use ,  quality and price . 
it produces an exceptionally clear ,  smooth and delicious cup . 
my place gets dusty with a minute s activity . 
but i am sure as it is used more it will become routine . 
therefore ,  $ for a new oem battery is a steal !  . 
they sync quickly with all num_num of my bluetooth devices . 
we have smokers in our family and a new born . 
buy it if you want excellent baking results . 
the glass makes them clean up nice and keeps them looking new . 
if you are more gentle than the commuter case with be fine . 
not much mess and little grease on the bacon . 
this is on at all times along witha smoke eater ashtray . 
these screens work good with the iphone num_extend
they are a nice thick plastic and screw on easily . 
don t have to stoop over to use it . 
it is of excellent quality and i love it . 
they seems nice but as with many things time will tell . 
but they vary greatly in how well they perform . 
very glad that i made the decision to purchase . 
due to its size it is really good for small spaces . 
since it floats ,  we case use it in the pool without concern . 
and scrambled num_num dozen num_extend eggs using the one skillet . 
coffee is oily and some of the grinds are dense . 
my daughter is very happy with her new cake pan . 
just be very careful to check it upon arrival . 
that is why they are designed with a small throat . 
i needed something a little bit smaller and this is perfect . 
made in france . i hope this was helpful to you . 
i bought it because my previous timer died . 
what i was really looking for was a battery powered knife . 
also ,  really hot utensils have impacted the plastic . 
if you re looking for an iphone num_num slim case then stop looking . 
i m not in love with where the water needs to be poured . 
as i had company coming i ran out and bought the hoover . 
with the iphone headphones the sound is perfect . 
toasting marks a little uneven but not really a problem . 
despite heavy knife use ,  there are no scratches that show . 
overall ,  an great product which i would buy again . 
we would never go back to the old wheel cutter . 
no clamps to frustrate and keeps crease better . 
great price on this item ,  cheaper than wal mart . 
i dropped it a few timesand it didn t break . 
i bought mine at a store to avoid shipping . 
i finally took a chance and ordered one from my pal ,  amazon . 
saves space and keeps the blade and me safe . 
it never occured to me that a lemon squeezer required such thorough cleansing . 
i used this overnight with my apple ipod touch . 
motor is not that loud for its size . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
you can see it through the cabin of the vehicle . 
i would have paid much more for this ,  most definitely . 
this is the perfect little vacuum for floors and cars . 
this is a very good ,  solid iphone case . 
the knockoffs don t keep coffe hot for even an hour . 
it cuts through tomatoes and mushrooms without damaging the vegestable . 
this is a charging platform which holds your battery . 
i was a little worried about buying this case . 
these were exactly what we needed for our sony speakers . 
had this for a few weeks now and have not had any problems . 
cotton rounds do fit in it no problem . 
i was tired of nylon and other plastic spatulas and turners . 
great quality from lodge and cooked a rosemary chicken perfectly . 
as long as the devices are num_extend ea . 
smoke has not been a problem at all . 
i bought other ones on amazon that were crapy . 
after looking at a lot of cases ,  we settled on this one . 
i purchased this as a gift for my brother who has physical limitations . 
there are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs . 
our climate is perfect for year round outdoor drying . 
it looks sleek and feels good in your hand . 
bought several of these to put in diff . 
i decided to purchase a bread machine for a number of reasons . 
bulkier than if you used a soldered version but . 
it is versatile ,  well made ,  and safer than most teflon . 
i also have armorsuit on my ipad screen . 
i hope he learns to love this lodge num_num qt . 
this garlic press isthe best that i have ever used . 
two for me ,  and one for my sister . 
many years since i have used ci cookware . 
my only gripe is these cases don t offer much protection . 
for the price you really will love this sprayer . 
i know i ve been burned that way more than once . 
i guess the life of this bluetooth is about num_num years . 
i ve got everything from large heavy books to figurines on these . 
i have devoted to this badge for years . 
i got this set about num_num years ago and we just love them . 
give it a few stirs with my spatula . 
i will not be without one from now on . 
overall i have had a good experience with this device . 
i would recommend this product to a friend . 
it improves contrast and reduces the overhead glare . 
note :  they are only half the size of a regular pen . 
we can cook num_num pancakes ,  pork chops ,  or burgers at once . 
would reconmend to keep your place daily clean . 
my parents are elderly and have no trouble using it at all . 
my wife bakes breads and pies ,  making them from scratch . 
i have to admit that this was an impulse buy . 
we make real vanilla to add to recipes . 
it also stays in the window fine without the extra hardware installed . 
imho this is slightly better than the moto num_extend
there is little to dislike about this device . 
this filter is a great little add on to my vacuum . 
great for working in the yard or exercise . 
after trying this product i am very pleased . 
i get a lot of compliments on it . 
please update picture to what you are selling . 
i used these on cake pops and had a ball . 
i got this set as a wedding gift last spring . 
so far i have not dropped it with this case . 
and charge time on this headset is very good . 
it does not hurt that it looks nice too . 
it is expensive but it s worth every penny . 
each square is num_extend in height x num_extend in length . 
it also seems to be a little denser glass than the old one . 
i ve bought several packs and have had some of them for years . 
you can not go wrong with ms chen . 
we enjoy using them very much ,  and are very pleased . 
it fits very snug and only protects the back of the phone . 
needless to say a greener way of doing it . 
if i washed dishes ,  i d definitely wash them in here . 
it fits my storm num_num snugly and wears quite comfortably . 
it was full when my bag was empty . 
i have tried various cuisinart ,  melita ,  krups ,  and delonghi . 
i was bummed but grateful it lasted that long . 
the pan is perfectly square on the inside and the coating is light . 
it comes on and goes off as needed to keep a constant temperature . 
not as loud as i thought it would be . 
not good to leave plug in at all times . 
i use it for my cereal and oatmeal . 
for the money it is a great slicer . 
they definitely last the num_num hours that they claim . 
the air purifier works in our basement apartment great . 
this style of whisk is my second most used one . 
the sound quality is good ,  but the volume is a bit low . 
it is heavy ,  so the double handles are a plus . 
i expected a flimsy item and was pleasently surprised . 
this is the best facinate screen protector out there . 
great product to preserve and store your dry good items . 
but this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth num_extend ummmm . 
i was pleasantly surprised to see how heavy the pan is . 
toby recommends this oven liner for a better cleaner oven . 
the portion with the indicator does not fully snap on mine . 
this accessorie is over priced considering what it does . 
nice tacky ,  slightly rubbery feel without being too soft . 
i do i do i do like this product . 
i had to have these for my baking needs . 
love it !  taller than the previous one i had . 
there are two different tools included num_extend of each  . 
also tells you battery life ,  so you can plug it in . 
beautiful finish makes foods attractive when served on this lovely peice . 
these pans are heavy and have been a great value . 
keep out of the reach of kids and incompetent individuals . 
i love photography and my evo num_extend takes great pictures . 
try launching a few programs then tap on the memory icon . 
it will take longer to bake because of its size . 
this is a genuine bissel product so it fit perfectly . 
it fit perfectly into my galaxy num_extend like the original cable . 
i don t think the $ list is worth it though . 
after reinserting it ,  the cleaner worked just fine !  . 
quality of the metal and finish is excellent . 
i could usually tell which one of my recycled lids wouldn t work . 
reduce cable clutter with this innovative retractable sync and charge cable . 
i find myself using the num_num incher more . 
it s fairly comfortable and fits stays put too . 
now i don t need to worry about batery anymore . 
it is very sturdy and look great in my kitchen . 
this bag does what it s supposed to do and is cheap . 
my sister left her iphone num_extend with black otterbox on her back bumper . 
put it inside the note num_extend fits and works perfectly . 
best scren protector for sensation out at the moment . 
it is the exact copy of my original atrix num_num battery . 
it comes up to temperature in under num_num minutes . 
these turned out to be just what the bachelor ordered . 
i had to have it sent in and replaced . 
hopefully it will last just as long if not longer  :   . 
my husband and i get a good laugh every laundry day . 
my other has a wire handle that is hard for me to manage . 
i can t imagine another model working any better . 
it is for this reason i decided on another brew and go . 
the ease of use and quality of product is as expected . 
not only is it obsessive ,  but it s a bit counter productive . 
lastly ,  this is generic china made unit under different brands . 
this stone is well made ad works awesome . 
thank goodness for duct tape ,  it will fix anything . 
it looks very attractive on the table and the cloth washes up nicely . 
i have had no problems with the lid and pouring . 
in the end thats whats important and oxo delivers on that . 
it also comes with a screen protector which is very easy to install . 
the pans evenly distribute the heat and cook the food fabulously . 
the original blackberry curve num_extend is a pretty amazing device . 
the inside is a soft black felt like material . 
they came on time and in good shape . 
it s decently thick ,  not too flimsy ,  and low profile . 
it takes away the sharp picture quality but you get used to it . 
i am reserving one star less since i just got this product . 
but once its on you phone its hard to take off . 
they are sized well and i like the colours . 
don t hesitate to get one even as a backup . 
our num_num year old loves it to make his own grillers with this . 
this pan was a surprise because it s made fron thick aluminum . 
i needed a nice looking toaster for the new upgraded house . 
not one was perfectly stable ,  they all had varying degrees of wobble . 
love all the different kinds of salad dressings and home made marinades . 
i throw this in my bag and bring it to work with me . 
have a couple of shun knives and they are sharp . 
i am really ,  really picky about my kitchen tools . 
gives extra life to a phone that used to barely last a day . 
they were dropped ,  thrown away on accident ,  washed countlessly . 
i read the reviews for this item prior to purchasing it . 
a second one is on my wish list for next order . 
the pan and the paddles are very easy to clean . 
i will never go back to pouring from a bottle . 
this chopper is certainly handy for chopping just about anything . 
it is so bright that in nearly blinds me while driving at night . 
they are exactly what they are supposed to be . 
with any luck you will never need to remove the iphone again . 
i chose to make these adjustments before i locked on the unit bracket . 
i was surprised with the ease of using this machine . 
wow what a great ,  sturdy little speaker for the price . 
and i will use these cutters on valentine s day ,  of course . 
hi everyone ,  well i just got this wok a couple weeks ago . 
this charger has worked as advertised so far . 
i will never purchase an off brand measuring cup again . 
it holds my oxo steel scrubber and a sponge . 
all contents are chopped to desired effect and takes little time doing so . 
i bought another one for a friend and it snapped off in shipping . 
it looks like a panda iphone this is sick as hell . 
i like the  metalized  fabric as the iron slides over it easily . 
but i was able to fix it with some superglue . 
i have had this stand for about num_num year now . 
original charger ,  just like the one that came with tablet . 
these measuring cups will in all likilhood outlast me !  . 
it would keep dropping off ,  and only sometimes pick itself up again . 
this is another good quality product from cuisinart . 
this is a great piece for your car . 
however ,  i could not get all the bubbles out . 
you can put them in the dishwasher ,  oven and microwave . 
what more is there to say about it ?  ^ . ^ . 
i had this thermometer for several years and used it almost daily . 
but you have to keep this vac just for specific purposes . 
it does what it says it will and it keeps it simple . 
it is pretty heavy though ,  so be careful . 
plugging it in in the correct direction immediately solves that problem . 
this product arrived at my home on time . 
works as advertised although i wish the size was abit bigger . 
the phone and the charger are barelly warm when charging . 
i love the fact that this is dishwasher safe . 
this lcd screen was a perfect fit for my motorola droid x . 
it isn t hot and cannot get burned onto the surface . 
you can replace sour cream with plain yogurt . 
the construction is only as durable as it needs to be . 
i use it all the time in my toast oven . 
this grinder worked great right out of the box . 
after all ,  life can t go on without hope ;  . 
the wood is beautiful with a natural finish . 
two and three pots a day it performs flawlessly . 
it cleans up very nicely ,  all the parts fit together well . 
this is a good heavy weight microwave cover . 
the whole shebang is a rather handy setup to have around . 
when i was done ,  i tried pulling the basket out . 
i found no issues with static in the bin . 
this is great when used with the isi cream whipper . 
amazon s corelle designs were more to my liking . 
it s the perfect size for mixing something together in a num_num oz . 
for some reason ,  it interferes with the transmission . 
our old masher had a thin handle and was tiring to use . 
i have a travel trailer  cottage  on a permanent site . 
this tool does just that ,  and ergonomically fits your hand . 
surprisingly ,  they paired easily and sounded really good . 
also keeps it looking as good as new . 
i will definitely be bringing this device along during my future excursions . 
decent gripping ,  and overall ,  worth protecting your $ evo . 
easy to clean and seem that they will last a lifetime . 
i like it because you can cut it to what size you need . 
if you re using a scooper ,  your using way too much energy . 
i have used this once and it worked beautifully . 
easily washable and is of very good quality . 
works really well and gets the dirt out . 
i got the perfect eggs the first time . 
these filters arrived kind of smashed but still usable . 
our favorite is waffle fries !   :  very little splatter when frying . 
i have horrible allergies in the spring and fall and this works great . 
my daughter loves this case and it protects the phone well . 
i m sorry i was unable to use it . 
well ,  he could not have been any happier . 
i didn t believe it till i tried it . 
the tray fits on the smaller tray of the grinder attachment . 
this seems better made but time will tell . 
i bake cakes at random and these help me transport my baked goods . 
  they were having lobsters  she went on and on about them . 
i use it num_num to num_num times a year . 
no longer a dull white or one color . 
the big question i asked myself was whether num_num cups was large enough . 
down side the varnish can be a little slippery . 
the hose where it connects to the vacuum rotates ,  creating smooth num_extend
 disclosure :  i received a review sample from the maker .   . 
but i needed something bright ,  classy and defender . 
it needs a lot more tlc than stainless or even nonstick . 
if i run into problems ,  i ll update this review . 
it has protection around the buttons which i wasn t expecting but like . 
the cable weight tends to make it crawl slowly across the desk . 
they also both emit a light  hissing  sound in the earpiece when talking . 
all in all ,  i highly recommend this item . 
made in france . i hope this was helpful to you . 
gives a great feel to the moto droid screen . 
i actually ended up using it to cut up the entire chicken . 
i wish there was just a pushbutton rather than the slide sensor . 
i use it when boating ,  at the beach or by the pool . 
after reading all the reviews on here ,  i wanted to thank everybody . 
in addition ,  i can put my hand inside to clean it . 
we bought this table for our college son s apartment . 
i rate this product as excellent and a very good buy . 
put onto my stainless sink for my dish wand num_extend and my sponge num_extend
much easier to use these with my phone as well . 
keeps coffee hot for more than an hour . 
best of all it worked with my num_extend controller . 
this time i blasted it with steam and it all wiped right off . 
customer service for presto is so far excellent . 
this is a generic case that boxwave just put their name on . 
bought the usb cable for my evo num_extend
we picked up just this one and have been very pleased with it . 
but other than that it works real nice . 
it is comfortable to use and the wood is beautiful . 
i little overpriced at num_extend but no quibbles about it s function !  . 
i ve been using these albums for years and i really like them . 
i used chock full o nuts ny blend and it came out great . 
they will not fit the smaller wide mouth jars though . 
this is a great french press coffee maker . 
holds my iphone num_extend like it was designed by apple . 
dual paddles get every bit of flour from corners . 
change these filters every month and they do a great job . 
great job amazon !  !  from me it is highly recommended . 
she thinks it is one of the best kitchen aids she has . 
this has completely replaced parchment paper for our baking needs . 
works on smooth floors as well as carpet . 
keeps it hot long enough for me to finish the pot . 
i swear by it and buy them for friends as gifts . 
basic hot air popper with no on off switch . 
i got the num_extend version of this battery in num_extend
and ,  then i love to eat what has been cooked . 
i would recommend this to everyone that does not want a flimsy turner . 
so far it works fine and hasn t given me any trouble . 
the set also fits together very well for storage . 
i like the black brushed aluminum on the back . 
it does as good of a job ,  not better . 
i know instructions are bad but you can t mess it up . 
i have had other steamers but this one is very professional . 
i use it on the induction top and it works fine . 
i have one and only one complain about this oven . 
it has a heavy and solid feel too it . 
i don t like to drink my tea boiling hot either . 
it also goes through the dishwasher just fine . 
it works well indeed . the plastic ladle is just ok . 
clear ,  readable  safe zones  for both fridge and freezer use . 
leak proof and holds quite a bit of liquid !  . 
all it all it performs just like a device twice its price ,  . 
these have definitely replaced all my old measuring cups and spoons . 
these containers are perfect for storing your dough in the frig . 
plastic that covering the screen very easy to scratch . 
this one works well ,  and i really like the colors . 
a total bargain at $ i would purchase another if need be !  . 
i didn t find any apps that might help expand this functionality . 
wish other things worked that way such as my mower . 
i trust motorola anyways they are cheap and replaceable . 
they are very nice utensils at a very fair price . 
unfortunately ,  that adapter is male ,  and only fits the num_extend cable . 
the keyboard is full qwerty ,  with a few shortcut keys around it . 
apple has a fantastic reputation ,  and rightfully so . 
this way you can keep your set together and still use them individually . 
i just bought one finally ,  actually my sister bought mine ,  lol . 
this is easy to use and powerful enough to do anything with . 
i hunt and love to eat fresh sausage . 
can t live without external batteries now that we ve got them !  . 
the other one broke the second time he used it . 
the suction cup hasn t fallen off in over a month now . 
the pyrex storage dish is a favorite of mine . 
this hoover stills works as well as the day i purchased it . 
definitely a good buy before you break your screen . 
we actually can be productive with these phones . 
just wet the little suction cups and put into place . 
the grill is metal and the whole unit feels pretty sturdy . 
the kit comes with everything you need to get the job done perfectly . 
nice heft to the pan ,  and even baking . 
beer premium gold edition home brew kit ,  i also purchased the mr . 
two dollars for a case is definitely worth the wait to get it . 
it also would not snap into any iaccessory i owned . 
nice not to have a big tangled mess of cords . 
the rabbit is the best of the batch . 
but in this case though i chose the cuisinart . 
frustrating ,  but the main function of peeling is smooth and easy . 
this really is a big deal if you dont use cds much anymore . 
but i spread homemade sauce over the rising dough . 
look like it will work great i hope . 
finally drinking water is good again ,  and tastes wonderful !  . 
this thermometer took num_num seconds to tell me my water was num_num degrees . 
this is a useful too ,  and an exceptional value .

these roll bags allow for custom sized bags ,  reducing waste . 
it looks good and it s not over priced . 
the bottom is filled with water and put on the stove top .

a must have if you want to bake cookies and keep them uniform . 
they work wonderful ,  so break resistant ,  take my word for it . 
great for moving cakes from a turntable to a cake stand . 
this is a great electric knife sharpener that is reasonably priced . 
most double boilers do not have a point to pour from . 
the unit has worked just fine and i have no complaints . 
this is one of the nicest phones i have used . 
they also include two ultra crystal screen protectors . 
this way the juice shoots out the bottom in a uniformed fashion . 
good quality product my wife loves it thanks . 
it went out on him ,  but our granddaughter fixed it for him . 
i am extremely pleased with the cooker and amazon s service . 
i d give it an % for extraction . clean up was easy . 
this motorola charger also charges the phone quicker . 
and other cleaning projects . good for soaking produts in it . 
these would be a great gift item too . 
first items i used it on was onions . 
no more mess when pouring batter in and had perfect cake layers . 
great product and more affordable than the mophie . 
otherwise ,  it was a great case while i had it . 
i thought for the price i would give it a shot . 
i heard my cell ring once ,  and then nothing . 
it s heavy !  but ,  it is well worth your purchase . 
it adds a little bit of bulk but not too much . 
the green indicator light is bright ,  but my bed blocks it . 
you cannot have a tough cut of meat with one of these . 
there s a little button to stop the spinning . 
they look great with any place setting on your table . 
sticks almost anywhere and holds everything in place . 
than i would bring the bags to target or somewhere that takes them . 
i always keep a larger anker charger in my car . 
 please don t be mean !  i m not burning the food . 
i was deeding all the pealing to process the apples . 
do yourself a favor and get at least two . 
with a num_extend amp charger it would take almost num_num hours . 
that one i had purchased at a dollar store for only $
honestly ,  i m not sure how i went so long without one . 
cant complain works great and for the money you wont either . 
works great !  ice cream comes out of the tub quickly and easily . 
i like the sturdy feel and various speeds for mixing about anything . 
my answer to that person is a resounding no . 
the lid just sits on top fitting into the grid . 
four stars because i find it hard to say i love a thermometer . 
all things considered ,  it s definitely worth its low purchase price . 
good thing i figured that our before sending it back as defective . 
i was concerned about this filter when i ordered it . 
parts arrive quickly and hopefully he will get the phone working . 
i use this dish for just about everything from casseroles to baker . 
i love the versatility of the usb cord for the charger . 
i don t know why i waited so long to order it . 
you can cook in them and then pop the lid on and store . 
i have been using this charger for over one year . 
this one has stood the test of time and wear . 
its just when it drops the case separates from each other . 
i wanted something fun and girly for my phone . 
my husband likes the versatility of this product . 
other than that ,  we are still enjoying this coffee maker . 
the slices are not equally spaced but who cares the job is quick . 
maybe i got a fluke ,  but it is great . 
i fill the coffee basket to the top and tamp just a bit . 
this doesn t bother me but some may not like it . 
as such ,  it is very big on  usability  . 
this is why i decided to go with this one . 
i love it !  i love it !  i love it !  . 
we leave in on the bottom rack for those emergency pizza s . 
it was just what i was looking for . 
the phone is not only unique but quite useful . 
i am so glad i did ,  i am much less frustrated . 
i originally received a pair of these when i purchased my first bb . 
my other pyrex dishes were either two small or too large . 
i received the clear model and love it . 
this is a solution for my problem of where to put the sponge . 
the lighter version is much easier to carry around than the older versions . 
if you take care of these ,  they will last many years . 
i did a lot of research and settled on the pro s series . 
i love them they go with almost anything that you may have . 
easy to clean and keep in the desk drawer . 
my husband just purchased his third of this coffeemaker . 
this is comfortable to wear and works very well . 
i sat there nervously waiting for something to go wrong . 
i boil the water and fill it half way . 
nothing fancy here ,  just a handy little tool . 
i bought a few of these for my children . 
braun ,  go hire a decent technical writer for god s sake !  . 
yes .  .  . i am a happy owner of this item . 
the sound clarity is good ,  as is the camera . 
i covered the pan and let the asparagus steam for about num_num minutes . 
i don t use them for commuting anymore ,  just for working out . 
my wife has been trying to make yogurt for quite some time . 
cool the pizzas on a wire rack again . 
i used it for sweet potatoes , tilapia , broccoli ,  anything really . 
this thing is wonderful and i use it everyday . 
plenty deep ,  nice finish ,  and easy to clean . 
ordered two because honestly they were less than $
yes ,  it is more expensive but well worth the cost . 
this is a great hot air popcorn popper . 
it arrived on time and i still use it . 
other than super glue ,  there really isn t a good solution though . 
makes it a bit awkwards to plug in a charger . 
i ve had two of these for about a year . 
better reviews are written than this one but i wanted to chime in . 
this item is exactly the size i needed . 
this is a great case for the mytouch num_extend
it is difficult to write num_num words about batteries . 
i use this case pouch num_num percent of the time . 
they are what they are ,  all the same if you ask me . 
it is not for flipping pancakes or burgers . 
so far i have avoided this by using wooden skewers . 
i am still looking for the perfect iphone case . 
glad i replace my old battery for this one . 
i have sharp knivesthat are now safer to use . 
i bought this item when i saw it reviewed on android police . 
that said ,  cast iron works beautifully for just about everything else . 
green hornet movie :  it was ok to watch it . 
if the dishtowel gets dirty ,  then it needs to be washed . 
with care ,  both they and the board should last a long time . 
processor is a little weaker than expected but overall no huge complaints . 
it is also much easier to disassemble and clean than i thought . 
thank you for your business and timely shipping . 
the pressure gauge didn t fogged up after num_num minutes . 
in my opinion a better design num_extend charging capacity is really good . 
get the other gender to make quick disconnect harnesses . 
this handy device makes bacon very well ,  but you must watch it . 
a friend had one  can t remember the brand  but it worked ok . 
used to temporarily mount flat tv antenna to window inside rv . 
curiosity moved me to again reverse the  nut  ,  and it worked perfectly . 
i think this is the best case for the evo num_extend
just got it today but none of the issues other reviewers noted . 
the pain is mild and bearable ,  but persistent . 
i bought six this time and i already had six . 
this is a solid pan that is made in the usa . 
this means you ruin your mix and have to start over . 
it goes where i want ,  when i want with no waste . 
be very careful when handling this knife  like any other  . 
it just indicates that the charger is inserted into the lighter correctly . 
had to pay to ship it back because it was not defective . 
it does well for all bacon products i ve tried including turkey . 
it s a nice large bundt pan for special occasions . 
make sure you actually understand just how small this thing is . 
i wished i had purchased one many years ago . 
just the right size for my husband and i . 
i have had this case for about num_num weeks or so now . 
i cannot honestly say which system is best ,  android or ios . 
it is really really easy to use and clean . 
also love the clean lines of the design . 
this battery replaces the original in my samsung fascinate . 
and i usually used to having my phones in my pocket . 
i bought this directly from amazon ,   not a third party seller  . 
don t let the name fool you ,  it is not rubber . 
packs a lot of power on a full charge . 
couldn t be easier to make a terrific and tasty spread . 
so the first time i used it ,  the paper got cooked . 
the bristles were angled and dirty when finished ,  but not melted . 
really makes a taco salad taste like ,  well ,  a taco salad . 
however ,  all oils will be removed soon by normal usage . 
note ,  the wine must be cold before it does into the cooler . 
they didn t break ,  i m more prone to misplace them . 
fits perfectly ,  though finish could be a little better . 
this tempering tool worked beautifully with the set and was a time saver . 
it s modern looking and matches our living room decor well . 
i ve had this cover about a month and it works well . 
this phone beats the android phones with it s web os operating system . 
so they are a huge win on this count . 
after several hours of online research ,  i decided on this ballistic case . 
bought two sets to use in making english muffins . 
these hepa filters are a must have for people with allergies . 
replaced my phone before this case whore out . 
i liked this brush so much i just ordered my second . 
it works as stated with both my ipod nano and my iphone num_extend
it is a really nice product and well worth the small price . 
the bottom two polls and his handle thingy that came with it . 
unlike any of the dozen or so peelers i ve had . 
as a lumbar pillow this did not work for me . 
i do not know what i would do without amazon . com . 
operation is fantastic and the microphone seems to work well . 
this canister does just as good of a job cleaning the carpet . 
the num_extend headset works flawlessly with those equipments . 
this stone is high quality ,  heavy ,  and will last a lifetime . 
but the popcorn that it makes is perfect . 
this is one of the best available and is priced very reasonably . 
this protector replaced the splash protector on my droid . 
this is a hyundai compared to a cadillac . 
we love this pot for storing garlic ,  which we grow . 
it does a nice job of shredding and slicing . 
i ve only used this twice so far it has worked very well . 
these are such a healthy alternative to plastic storage bowls . 
i was very satisfied in how it was packaged and ease of assembly . 
i like this case because it is flexible and easy to take off . 
and it s big ,  num_extend qts is a lot of pan . 
i m very satisfied with this small but powerful vacuum . 
i got this case for my mom and she loves it . 
glad it was available with the free super saver shipping . 
i love it cause my mother just raves about it . 
this is a bluetooth stereo headset ,  plain and simple . 
amplifies pretty well ,  but there is not a lot of bass . 
i can charge my spare batteries and phone at the same time . 
today ,  i thought i wonder if someone invented a better salad spinner . 
the cord is long enough for me ,  about num_num feet . 
i have this mounted to the visor of my suv . 
so glad to add this to our kitchen . 
i would advise when hanging it to have a stud finder . 
overall it is a good headset and well worth a try !  . 
i am a huge fan of cast iron . 
i use the original charger at my desk at work . 
i kick my turkey off at a rippin  num_num degrees . 
well ,  it still gets a num_num star aftre all this time !  . 
you will need to remove the cover before attempting to charge the phone . 
but it s nice to have some extra life when it counts . 
very well made and a great little size . 
this norpro stainless funnel is pretty close to perfect . 
i also purchased the otterbox defender for the atrix . 
we were able to contact otterbox through their website . 
it provides convenience and protection in a smart looking ,  rugged case . 
the bumper case looks good and feels great in your hand . 
it works perfectly with voice dialing and voice commands . 
got these for my cat to eat from . 
don t add too much liquid ,  you don t need it . 
the push lever is super easy to operate . 
all around great ,  even my husband commented he like them . 
this is what you would expect of corelle . 
i ve heard so many horror stories about them blowing up . 
i use the griddle side to toast or warm buns . 
think of this oil like  thompson s water seal  for your butcher block . 
i will be buying more as housewarming gifts for friends !  . 
this is not a clean install nor the way the mount should work . 
while it was annoying ,  it wasn t the end of the world . 
my daughter definitely eats more pancakes than she normally would . 
love the way the box has you layer the food . 
ordered these as part of a complete revamp for my old vacuum . 
cooking speed seems to be quicker than most . 
but sound quality  i . e .  ,  clarity  is a close second . 
it is made of plastic almost entirely ,  but seems sturdy . 
i clean mine in my dishwasher and it still looks great . 
this is very secured ,  so no more tea leaf escape . 
it is easy to use ,  just plug it in . 
this is a fairly inexpensive knife and great for slicing thin slices . 
it does not make it feel bulky at all . 
i have been using three of these bowls for three years . 
also it has an invaluable warming option that most do not have . 
the sound quality is commensurate with a headset in this price range . 
it functions a good protection for my iphone . 
i bought this product for my mother and she likes them very much . 
she loves it and enjoys having fresh nutmeg . 
almost too well ,  that i nearly burned my mini frangipane tarts . 
use the weights and the pie crust came out great . 
this product is perfect for small casseroles and the like . 
zojirushi lasts a long time and has very accurate thermostats . 
i previously bought one of these icarriers num_extend external battery . 
this case fits great and feels great too . 
this screen protector fits my wifes droid num_num perfectly . 
long cable permits charging your device from a long distance . 
i love the feel and look of the tempered glass . 
i have had it for almost a year now . 
this is the best bluetooth i have had . 
i liked this cookie rack because it is larger than most . 
hasn t caused me any trouble yet and works very well . 
also ,  it was shipped within a couple of days . 
this is not an issue because the mount grips the phone really well . 
so that is my fault for not paying closer attention to the specs . 
my husband and i were fighting over who got to use it first . 
i was so happy that i found this . 
a major feature is the bright colors it comes in . 
on the other hand ,  i really like palm hardware and software style . 
easy to replace if you know what you are doing . 
its cute ,  feels like very textured plastic and sturdy . 
but great product and a nice feature to have with the kitchenaid . 
professional sharpening was definitely not in my budget ,  way to expensive . 
i had no trouble placing the screen protector on both of my blackberry num_extend
the sound quality remains excellent even at extremely low or high volumes . 
this thing is crazy easy to use and sooo fast . 
it is a cute ,  fun popcorn maker when you have friends over . 
i saw these at the container store and went home with thelarge . 
i love spinach and my husband dislikes it . 
installed one of them and it works well . 
it fits nicely on my countertop with room on top to put things . 
i have each pair of earrings in a single pocket . 
seems solidly built and came in a very nice case . 
i definitely recommend it if you need a replacement . 
num_num stars if it fit more in the ear than on it . 
lastly ,  for the price it is definitely a good deal . 
i have had no problems at all with is sticking . 
wok stirring or around contoured pan bottom edges . 
we did our homework on this one and read all about the honeywell num_extend
so we re going on num_num years of use . 
kepps a good edge and feels good in the hand when cutting . 
plus i like items like these that are washable . 
i now only use the press for travel . 
properly seasoned nothing cooks quite like cast iron . 
quality is what you would expect from a low cost unit . 
i love this thing and use it all the time . 
they re just the perfect size for a lot of everyday uses . 
it fits ,  it charges ,  and it appears to work . 
it is also great for cooking fluffy rice . 
i have one in my office and one at my house . 
my wife normally just uses it for her toast and bagels . 
you can aerate the wine in the glass . 
not good if you drop your phone on concrete or ceramic tiles . 
this is a really nice product ,  sturdy and quality steel . 
the charge last quite a while so you can get a lot done . 
this is the best product i ve seen for iphone num_extend
i bought this for my son in law ,  and he loves it . 
it doesn t look or feel cheap to me . 
what you get is as follows : >> replacement gasket and screen . 
the touchstone required a num_num amp draw and this has it . 
it may be the last one you buy . 
other than that i have had no problems with it . 
the lids are on the top and there is room to spare . 
again ,  i love the wok for it is well done . 
definitely worth the twenty five dollars i paid for them . 
if your looking for an adapter ,  this is it . 
this pair of shears is the best pair we have ever had . 
couldn t wait to brew our first pot of pressed coffee . 
my daughter asked to try them and she thought they were great . 
they note an alternative to brining they like ,  too . 
works just like my original but for a much lower purchase price . 
what would normally take several minutes takes less than a second . 
this has provided me with the opportunity to test them all . 
apparently the outlet in the rental car was dead . 
cleans up well ,  stays clear ,  an excellent product . 
i recommend this for anyone who enjoys cooking . 
i ve had these for about num_num months now and still not a num_extend
i didn t notice that when i checked out . 
wife and i just used our classics last night . 
takes up very little space ,  and is convenient . 
the num_num foot cable is long enough for most purposes . 
which is really disappointing ,  but not a deal breaker for me . 
the port was completed less than num_num hours later . 
i considered not using one until i found this one . 
my sister got a kitchen aid mixer for christmas and needed a cover . 
i recently got married ,  and my sisters purchased this for my shower . 
i like white chocolate mochas and had attempted them using regularly brewed coffee . 
i ve discovered that this model is very lightweight and comfortable to wear . 
it is also attractive with the wooden base . 
i ll probably get the large scoop for muffins . 
it cooks in half the time the big gas oven does . 
it s just an all around perfect cutter ,  i love it . 
i love it because everything just slips right off it . 
some complained that the logos looked different on the batteries they received . 
it is reasonably quiet and grinds the seeds up very nicely . 
adjusts easily without having to unlock or switch anything . 
i read that and others before purchasing this  steamvac  . 
the wusthof blade shapes cut and chop better than the henckels to me . 
i will give additional info on that feature once i tried it . 
i m mostly concerned about it possibly rusting in the spring handle area . 
it doesn t mean they re dirty ,  it means they re seasoned . 
this holder works great and i like it a lot . 
it also has a easy to empty crumb tray . 
wish they would add an alert for those !  . 
it took forever to bring up a website . 
the tablespoon is the size of a serving spoon .  .  . almost . 
beats the comparable make griddle ,  both used on a gas stove . 
the plastic trays and lid can all go in the dishwasher ,  top num_extend
good flavor ,  and the machine functioned as it should . 
some are saying the drip tray does not snap in . 
i use this several times per week and love the small size . 
also helps with picking up dough from countertop . 
i like this product and would buy another one in the future . 
this knife is as expected also great for slicing roasts . 
it is reasonably thick enough to give a good protection . 
it looks better without it and there s less splashing that way . 
its great for making snacks for those who hate apple peels . 
we could tell an immediate improvement in flavor over our mr . 
i think i have used this pan almost everday since i bought it . 
did it s job till needed a new one . 
it s also great for opening cans of evaporated milk . 
i would recommend this if you are looking for a mandoline . 
this is just a regular and working micro usb cable . 
this is much easier to access and a lot better looking . 
it does not require any additional pressure to work the buttons . 
overall ,  they are usable and a nice design for the modern kitchen . 
those striped cukes that you see on salad trays are done this way . 
don t expect it will take the place of your bbq tools . 
ice cold water will resulte in slightly less hot coffee . 
driving car and don t tuch the smatrphone is grate . 
they were easy to put on and remove to change them . 
love scooping out my pure as driven snow yogurt from it every morning . 
the mail client meshes well with the nokia address book . 
so glad i did ! it mounts in your cd slot . 
the really unusual thing is having a set with back covers . 
it s easy to empty and it dries out pretty quickly . 
nice to have to help organizing small stuff on bathroom counter . 
it is a handy addition to my gadget stash . 
the plus is it will use any ac micro usb charger . 
look for something bigger if you re wanting to boil more water . 
this is a really good kitchen tool to have . 
how can you beat a nice leather pouch for six bucks . 
not sure what folks are saying here about top heavy . 
to help you understand ,  i learned to type on a  manual  typewriter . 
i have a num_extend generation ipod that supports bluetooth devices . 
no noticeable difference between this and the charger that came with the evo . 
its a great price for the sound that you get . 
also ,  it just looks fantastic out on the counter . 
the older bottles were a solid num_num stars . 
decent quality but don t bang them around or they ll dent . 
it grates effortlessly and produces a very fine zest when used with citrus . 
it also cleaned very well in my opinion . 
other than than ,  the picture is accurate for what you ll get . 
we buy one of these toasters about every num_num to num_num months . 
i would recommend ordering one of those to accompany this . 
i can t wait to try some of newtrent s other products !  . 
wished i had more than one fish to descale . 
is it worth the fortune you have to pay ?  probably not . 
i love it and would buy another should this one quit working . 
i like using this utensil for making cheese slices for an appetizer tray . 
i did not waste twenty seconds pouring the first cup . 
i also used this on the beach to protect my phone . 
i plan to order many more and throw away all my tuperware . 
definitely recommended for anyone who needs a key for the sim tray . 
love the atrix ,  it was my first android after jumping from blackberry . 
the pan was easy to use and pancakes came out great . 
my phone still worked after dropping it several times in this case . 
this is a rugged ,  well made ,  and beautiful thermos . 
this little blue tooth device works perfectly with my iphone num_extend
i don t use the lid as much as i though i would . 
this little knife makes cutting fruit and peeling very easy . 
this turner is very good for turning food in a skillet . 
this mug has everything i look for in a travel mug . 
let s see how it does after a month or so . 
does just as well at grinding coffee as expensive burr grinders . 
you will most likely keep it at full volume . 
this grinder is the best you can get . 
a must have for everyone that wants beautiful carpet !  . 
i replaced the trackball and tried to replace the retaining ring . 
however ,  all this is almost entirely outweighed by its extreme convenience . 
for practical use ,  assume they all hold less then advertised . 
they are heavy duty stands and should last for some time . 
you do not need to add any oil to the tortilla . 
first and foremost ,  it protects everything it needs to . 
this one is stainless steel and has a heavy bottom to prevent sticking . 
i can t explain why ,  but they taste even better that way . 
i am the worst screen protector aplier in the world . 
i use this feature every day when brewing my regular num_num cups . 
it is heavy and all the components are made well . 
it cleans up pretty well ,  and most things don t stick . 
i grilled some meat on this ,  and it turned out really great . 
it does exactly what is was advertised to do . 
with the lid i find the thermal quality is better than anything else . 
looking for a similar product for my nexus num_num now . 
putting on this case did not interfere with my screen protector . 
i use these with my touch pro num_num and the pocketplayer app . 
so i really don t get any  juice  on my hands . 
it connects to the phone easily and is very good quality of sound . 
been using the queen size model over a month now . 
it fits well in your hands and feels secure . 
make sure you use the microfiber to clean the surface well . 
a small blue led indicates that the charger is functioning correctly . 
i have several car chrgers and this one is my favorite . 
i ve also never had a hinge break ,  after hundreds of uses . 
taking it apart ,  blowing out the dust ,  reassembling it . 
i am single and a regular broiler pan was just too big . 
this was a gift for a family member . 
my husband has a nexus num_num and i have a num_extend
as usual ,  we are pleased with their recommendation . 
david ,  a techie friend introduced me to the jambone jambox red . 
 now i can do away with my clock radio !   . 
i hate to chop so found this little gem . 
it does a nice job of filtering and it is easy to clean . 
the first one sprung a leak after many years of faithful service . 
the phone still works excellent as a data and texting device . 
it arrived earlier than expected which was just in time for the shower . 
i ve had mine for a year now and it still works perfectly . 
coffee oils clog up the pores of the basket . 
the all around encasement of this is a great concept . 
perhaps they could have made a ridge around the top edge to grasp . 
i ordered this one from amazon and it fits well . 
not a peep thus far our of the farberware . 
i have never used it but i was told that it cuts well . 
only mandoline that has ever worked for me . 
doesn t slip out of my hands as easily . 
the blades that come with it do pretty much everything i need . 
like that it sits up and it charges quick . 
seems to be extra tough and the color is fantastic . 
there is nothing like these roasters if you want moist poultry and meats . 
i purchased this skillet after reading many reviews . 
i went through num_num other small fryers before getting this one . 
i got these to match my callaway impressions dinnerware . 
we ve used this little thermometer for years ,  now . 
would recommend it since it is glass except for the plastic top . 
it looks like pretty much motorola has maximized the effectiveness of this hardware . 
i like ice cream scoops like this product . 
this is by far a better quality case . 
there is no easier or quicker way to make large quantities of hashbrowns . 
however ,  the product does work and is easily worth $
all coils are covered ,  so all energy is used . 
glad i didn t get a cheaper clay based one . 
i think that makes this extended battery appear that much more amazing . 
it helps me limit the amount of coffee i drink a day . 
it feels solid and has a good look . 
fits nicely in my small stubby little hands . 
i bought two sets and relegated my plastic to sending leftovers with friends . 
there are settings one can personalize on this lapdock num_extend
it is a little odd to use ,  however . 
other than that ,  great purchase and worth the money !  . 
i hosted a crab fest and these things were a great hit . 
i have three sets now ,  and get them for others . 
better than a lot of my other covers . 
good enough to use anywhere and keep the oem one safe at home . 
it works as advertised and i am happy with that . 
being able to listen to audio through the headset is a plus . 
does not stick ,  easy to clean ,  nice to look at . 
i bought this to use in the car with my samsung galaxy num_extend
not what it was made for ,  but came in handy . 
i advise finishing the opened bottle within two to three days if possible . 
it was so cumbersome ,  neither of us really used it . 
it didn t take long for my mytouch num_extend to find this device . 
this is very unique since it is very neat other than cheap products . 
nevertheless it s fabulous to have in my kitchen . 
at this time i am not concerned about num_extend connectivity . 
and the best part is that our cookies don t stick . 
little to say about it; the knife block works just as advertised . 
it s definitely worth it to get the right filters . update dec . 
a little bit flimsy but it s all i require in my kitchen . 
it s exactly the same one that came with my samsung smartphone . 
i found these glasses ,  ordered them ,  and haven t been happier . 
it flattens out easily ,  but that doesn t seem to hurt much . 
put the inner lid over the basket ,  then the locking cover . 
most importantly though i liked the accessories with the kitchenaid . 
clicked it on and he was good to go . 
fairly heavy  which i like  ,  well balanced ,  very sharp . 
even though the first one i ordered wasn t a usb adapter charger . 
ha ,  do you realize how much this stuff weighs ?  !  . 
i m very satisfied with the product and service . 
i got mine num_num years ago for about $
it s only just showing signs that it might need to be replaced . 
this is worse with some  oily  beans than others . 
great style ,  good quality ,  and perfect size knife for the kitchen . 
your mileage may vary depending on your drawer space and orientation . 
we bought this about a year ago and were very happy with it . 
love the angled cups !  makes it so much easier . 
i have had this for a year and i like it . 
it takes forever to determine your location .  .  .   amen to that . 
i m almost positive this was the glitch that some reviewers had . 
i admit i had my doubts when i opened these . 
the scale is a  bit of fancy  that some might find useful . 
a little pricey ,  but a bargain compared to the more boutique sets . 
this is our second presto hot air popper . 
it took a while for me to receive and it didn t fit . 
like everyone else i ve had plenty of measuring spoons . 
and our coffee grinder is not that great and produces more fine grind . 
trust me ,  for the money you can t go wrong . 
i like the simple design but i just noticed something funny . 
it is as good or better than the quality from the handset . 
it is actually better than having to hold it down on my earpods . 
also it can also make the items liquidy . 
both my husband and i have been using our magnifica daily . 
this isn t the fastest coffee maker out there . 
delivery was super quick ,  arrived num_num day before the expected date . 
four stars because it is not cheap at all . 
the godshall s apparently has thicker slices because num_extend was not enough . 
this thermometer was perfect for what i wanted . 
it s a compromise in many ways ,  but in a good way . 
i ve had mine on my iphone for almost a year . 
this gives you several large icons ,  easy to hit with one hand . 
it has a silvery lace appearance making doilies unnecessary . 
made me aware of dutch ovens and their uses ,  andb . 
i wanted a new charger that would charge more efficiently . 
love all oxo products ,  and this is no exception !  . 
the charger cradle is nice and seems very sturdy . 
easy to assemble ,  easy to use and great drying rack for pasta . 
now i use the other two more than i use the paring knife . 
this marble board is of high quality . this marble board is wonderful . 
additionally ,  this feels sturdy and does the job well . 
all connections fit well and it does the job . 
they are made from reinforced steel and have a great rubber handle . 
so far they ve been easy to use and manage in the kitchen . 
there are two lights on the top of the unit . 
you will not go wrong on this one . 
the wood and finish are nice and would look good in any kitchen . 
these are good sized boards ,  and pretty good quality . 
the triangular tool seems pretty useless so far . 
this memo has exceeded my expectations and my fridge became more beautiful . 
she will enjoy using the num_num spice racks i ordered in her kitchen . 
not hard at all !  the product went on perfectly . 
it a holster type case with a belt clip and magnetic clasp . 
i really like the results i got and recommend the product . 
i love this spoon ,  insofar as one can love a spoon . 
the other lid gives an additional spacing or something like that . 
i purchased the otterbox commuter for it and he couldn t be happier . 
add egg mixture all at once to dry mixture . 
they are easy to clean ,  don t stain easily  i . e . 
with the replaceable tips ,  why would i need anything else ?  . 
it keeps the phone battery at % without a glitch . 
i sent it back and tried the jawbone era much to my disappointment . 
i also like the size of the cutting board . 
for the most part it is the right size for two people . 
the only thing the num_extend has over this is volume . 
my girlfriend received one of these for christmas . 
i recommend these protective screen skins without reservation . 
the power and side buttons are still easy to access . 
but ,  it s great for small recipe books as well . 
this one is heavier and so much easier to use . 
i like this spatula for it s size and angle . 
it plowed through the task with no mess or waste . 
i was able to hear turn by turn directions and music fairly clearly . 
used for my son s first birthday cake and it turned out great . 
it just makes for a difficult and confusing experience . 
this case was the best thing otterbox ever did . 
when i leave the car and come back it automatically reconnects . 
always good to keep an extra one around . 
scones ,  cookie dough and pancake batter so far . 
alot cheaper t heb buying premade shells at the storefur just . 
you have to set it back on the charger ,  in between passes . 
it has proven to be terrific all around the house . 
the screen is rather small and hence sometimes difficult to read . 
the sound is just not perfect for me . 
i can fill the fryer fairly full with no significant drop in temp . 
the only thing i would change about the stylus is the size . 
they last about num_num months and it s thrashed . 
i find it essential and i recommend it . 
in num_num days i have had it on for at least num_num hours . 
i remember when buying an espresso maker this nice was a huge investment . 
dang bubba and bubberette when they say tough they are not exaggerating . 
nevertheless ,  it is still in service and performing extremely well . 
i have put this in the dishwasher and it has done just fine . 
the sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs . 
i can t think of any thing to carp about this case . 
the shipping was reasonable for where it was shipped from . 
bear in mind .  . this is a rugged and bulky case . 
i ve used it for frozen drinks and soups . 
this sweeper makes for quick and easy clean up . 
i have been using them and love them . 
i think it will last quite some time . 
if they cook ,  this will answer your question supurbly . 
but ,  it works flawlessly so i can t complain . 
its a sturdier little tamper than it looks like . 
it arrived in a month ,  but it also came from hong kong . 
one more reason cast iron is better for the environment and our num_extend
it s great for making different sized  height  cakes . 
i went to work and steamed those seats . 
the only downside is that it is bulky . 
this pan is everything i was looking for in an omelet pan . 
works just as well as more expensive versions . 
their design is clean and contemporary and matches our other silverware nicely . 
loved that thing and in fact i still do . 
i think it is a good idea to be prepared just in case . 
i m not sure what you can say about a frying pan lid . 
ill definitely recommend this product to a friend . 
i love that they fit in their own tin . 
the cover fits well ,  does not come off easily . 
the plastic is fairly cheap and doesn t feel super sturdy . 
then i spent a while online using wifi . 
i see where a picture shows one person s pan peeling . 
this case is fantastic if you drop your phone . 
i finally broke down and bought one of these . 
this is a satisfactory nonstick skillet but there are certainly better ones available . 
i live in new jersey and my tap water tastes horrible . 
the motor is very quiet ,  relative to other vacuums i ve owned . 
these people have it together with all the comfort and usability in mind . 
there is absolutely nothing to dislike about this case ,  especially for $
do yourself a favor and buy a pack or two . 
the lower settings seem to be fine for room conversations and television . 
i was disappointed ,  but not enough to send it back . 
i have used this for white ,  red and sweet potatoes . 
the entire knife is quite light and easy to manipulate and handle . 
the charger arrived early and it does it s job . 
what more can you say ?  they work well . 
they are blue or red ,  but always on . 
i am looking foward to many happy years with it . 
either way the case looks great and i really like how it looks . 
it is ideal for this type of repair mobile phones . 
it just seems a little bulky to store . 
they are great for listening to music while working out . 
i process all of our cereal with the electrolux flaker . 
after this i am being buying a couple of them . 
fans of the other shaped le creusets will love this beauty . 
once i received this battery my phone started charging and staying fully charged . 
so i d say go with your normal size . 
had to wait a while on shipping but was well worth the wait . 
this works better than cheesecloth and colander or sieve . 
or i can cut up some potatoes and spread them under the rack . 
i am handicapped and use a scooter and can reach everything . 
it is always on the counter ,  ready to use . 
at first i was skeptical because it feels cheap and flimsy . 
i have used french white baking dishes by corning ware for years . 
this one is built to last !  highly recommend it !  . 
i find it very responsive and battery life seems to be very good . 
this is some good powerful stuff ,  just sucked everything from my carpet . 
it is easy to use and easy to clean . 
this is a nice case that fits an iphone num_extend
i purchased one just like it sometime ago and i lost it . 
it s the texture that gets a little tricky . 
small and easy to store away and great for everyday ironing needs . 
the scale has five buttons along the edge . 
over time it gets dirty ,  but hey ,  its a case . 
this phone is a multitasking ,  num_extend gaming champ . 
this morning ,  the coffee coming out of it is still apparently steaming . 
great for keeping leftovers organized and for storing prepared fruits and veggies . 
i use this to charge both my iphone num_extend and my hp touchpad . 
no blood shot or sore sunken feeling eyes with them on now . 
my husband and i each have different preferences when it comes to coffee . 
i like it much better than the ones with the rubber gasket . 
our popcorn tastes like popcorn again instead of some flavored chewy num_extend
this is a very high quality product at a terrific price . 
the cork on my blue label bottle crumbled because it dried out . 
first off ,  it is very well designed from an engineering standpoint . 
the materials used were just as i had hoped . 
the clean up is just as easy too . 
i got this thing for filleting salmon last summer . 
this case is perfect for protecting the mytouch . 
but it is as good as my more expensive pitchers . 
she s happy with it so that s all that matters . 
i did not use the screen shield that came with it . 
this is the best maker you can buy . 
these work so well and easily with my dehydrator . 
these are truly some of the loveliest dishes and complimentary pieces . 
the slide doesn t wobble when opened or closed . 
and even that little difference is just a decal . 
i submitted the problem online and amazon shipped another set to me . 
it can not be disassembled without destroying it . 
it made for a delicious very smooth smoothie with no chunks in it . 
it s easy to set and we ve found it be very accurate . 
the color is great and the workmanship is beyond my expectations . 
these are very nice for folks who have trouble gripping slick surfaces . 
not a reasonable test ,  but it did happen . 
could have used a hand grater for better and faster results . 
it s just a great kitchen accessory to have . 
it is a very handy and sturdy equipment . 
every one comes out the same :  delicious and perfectly brown . 
i m sure the holster would give the case additional points !  . 
for the most part ,  i no longer use parchment paper when baking . 
wish i had bought one a long time ago . 
nevertheless ,  i still give the machine num_num stars . 
i wanted a vac to use on my laminate flooring . 
that original mat has held up well for the last num_num years . 
there s good bass and the overall stereo sound was nice . 
the inside of the bowl is uniformly round . 
like some other reviewers have already said ,  it s pretty small . 
like all other kitchen timers ,  there is no off switch . 
these silicone spatulas are the highly recommended ones from a leading cooking magazine . 
i purchase num_num and wish i had ordered more . 
one problem ,  the muffin tin is too wide for the toaster oven . 
it indeed fits the num_extend perfectly and looks good . 
i really don t have anything bad to say about this . 
but it is not as large as i would have liked . 
you still can t beat the oster beehive blender . 
they perform as expected and work for him . 
the colors are very alive and this truly stands out with statement . 
this works just as i wanted it to . 
purchased three of these origininally ,  another three thereafter . 
separator is very good with little fat carryover . 
the spring loaded feature makes  installing  them in your drawer incredibly easy . 
i like the temperature control ,  especially for sf weather . 
i coated it with a clear protective coating to avoid rust . 
i threw away my toaster oven and microwave . not needed with this . 
i have cooked personal size pizzas and they fit nicely . 
the lovebirds can be seen on all blue willow designs .  there then . 
there are nuances of good flavor without the bitterness . 
it does  not  automatically set the  driving mode  on . 
whilstcharging ,  the unit becomes slightly lukewarm; not alarmingly hot like somedevices . 
according to the sticker on the back ,  they are made in china . 
i needed one and this was priced similar to the discount stores . 
washing by hand is preferred although you could put it in the dishwasher . 
plus ,  i then store the salad in it and it is perfect . 
adds up to about five gallons a day . 
its dimensions are num_extend length x num_extend width x num_extend thickness . 
makes cookie baking so much quicker . great product ,  great price . 
but besides this ,  the keyboard is just amazing . 
the person on the other end never complains . 
i love it !  it is dish washer safe . 
it comes with a stock num_extend phone battery . 
it seems to work good now after using it for a few months . 
it has the feel of a professional s tool . 
i only wish they covered the entire phone face . 
the handset fits snuggly in the base with no play . 
i got them to replace a very old set of henkels paring knives . 
use it to bake biscuits or anything really . 
charged them up and now listening xm from my iphone num_extend
work great ,  stay white after baking and just the right size . 
will buy again once i run out of the ones i got . 
i need it to listen while at work from my android phone . 
best ever and a must have for anyone who cooks routinely with garlic . 
the issue is with the receiving ear speaker . 
i have another knife like this one that is num_num years old . 
this thing is amazing ,  works like a charm . 
other than that it is a cable for very cheap and it works . 
you can set the slider switch to get the waffle you want . 
i love the way food tastes cooked on cast iron . 
it works great when i need to work on larger pieces . 
i m accustomed to the heavier calphalon commercial pots . 
num_num from a complete stranger ,  one from a friend .

there s almost nothing i can add to the reviews that precede mine . 
loved this product !  made my phone more sophisticated . 
i use it with an iphone num_num in a lifeproof case . the num_extend
i realize that some people pay top dollar for top of the line . 
i can t say enough great things about this two sided griddle . 
i suppose if it s too annoying i can bend one prong slightly . 
i would look elsewhere for a better price . 
i was so surprised when i received this tool organizer . 
i have not had any problems with the three that i have ordered . 
i m not easy on them either ,  especially the green one . 
these might be better suited for a milder climate . 
so i decided to purchase some for myself . 
this is far and away our favorite one to use . 
i can wash it easily after frying chicken .

easy to use and works fine so far . 
looks just like hello kitty  i ve seen others that don t  . 
this particular mug is a great one and a classic really .

nothing to complain about when the cable works like a charm . 
came from amazon bent up due to the box being beat up . 
i just followed the belgium waffle recipe that came with the packaging . 
i have multiple cords all around the house . 
i also bought the num_extend female to usb female to charge the transformer . 
can t wait to get more use out of it . 
it s easy to install just be patience and take your time . 
my greatest appreciation is the design of it . 
these pans are perfect for making vietnamese sizzling crepes  banh xeo  . 
it will result in a home made beer you can be proud off . 
this is my num_extend screen protector on my samsung galaxy s num_extend
in use ,  it s faster than the epic s hardware keyboard . 
five stars for an inexpensive but eminently useful kitchen tool . 
i m having serious a goldilocks syndrome on screen covers . 
also has caller id  will read you the number that s calling  .

i am using the belkin stylus with my acer iconia num_extend android tablet . 
i got it to have a hands free headset while driving . 
they loved the colors and the designs of the cranes quite a bit . 
this allows me to charge more often and also acts as a spare . 
they are great pans ,  no problems at all . 
it will serve me well during the summer . 
still ,  i like the price and that amazon prime convenience . 
it s not a massive temp shift ,  but it is noticeable . 
easy to handle large buttons and dial when wearing gloves . 
a bit pricey ,  but built to last and attractive . 
everything must be put together just right for it to work .

it s great to know that amazon was so cooperative . 
i don t know what you could possibly do with that many . 
i wouldn t bother with herbs unless you have a lot of them . 
it looks and feels like a large fireplace . 
buy this case it worth it and the company rocks . 
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews . 
the motor seems to be able to hand the grind without slowing down . 
the key is not to try to do it in one big squeeze . 
 i do this while waiting for the water to num_extend
i simply rinse this under the faucet and add coffee . 
le creuset continues to surpass my expectations with their quality and perfection . 
i knew this skillet was going to be large but it looks enormous . 
just like the one at the sprint store and far cheaper too .

i love this spatula and will buy more . 
i ve found this whisk to be just that . 
so ,  i decided to try a different way of making coffee . 
the world it s in your hands now that you have the nokia num_extend
this is best simple invention ever !  we use garlic a lot . 
and got it a day earlier than estimated . 
it s also well priced and it gets sent quickly . 
i can use my ipad without having to worry about stretching the cable . 
do not try to put raw foods into it and expect juice . 
it comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook . 
this spatula is exactly what i ve been trying to find . 
i consider this method far safer than using the chef s knife . 
great fit with an open bottom which accommodates the new chargers . 
i ve had this epicurean garlic press for many years . 
i will by more of this fiesta bowls . 
it was a great deal and still using it after some time now . 
i use it for just about anything that i need a saucepan for .

i love the brita so much and drink so much water . 
i appreciate the ability to change the air flow direction . 
my local mall was selling theses defenders in basic boaring solid colors for $
and this is the only case i used on my num_extend
the droid bionic is such a battery hog . 
i stupidly pulled something off my counter that had the phone on it . 
simple ,  easy ,  convenient way to get tasty bacon !  . 
i plan to purchase another set so that i have two sets . 
this little chopper is fantastic and is different than others i ve used . 
it has made the storage in my kitchen more efficient . 
then chances are that this charger will work for you . 
it was very bulky ,  but the protection that it provides is unequal . 
the battery life is truly superior to other headsets i ve had . 
i ve also sprayed some solution on my screen . 
buy this if you like to take pics and want more options . 
it s a big grinder ,  but works like a champ . 
the example the reviewer used was  strawberry pizza ,   pg num_extend
but with the wifi repeater ,  it s usually not a big deal . 
most of the electic tea kettles require it . 
i simply wet them with a little water and they stuck perfectly . 
but for the price its a good deal . 
i use it for smoothies a couple of times a week . 
blends sauces well ,  and is well worth its cost in multiple uses . 
i guess i should have know that from the get go . 
i used it for years and sold it at a garage sale . 
i use this rotisserie at least once a month . 
i am a bit biased as i insist on having a physical keyboard . 
i have owned he four star series for many years . 
this makes the most tender ribs you ll ever ever ever find . 
excellent product ,  works perfect ,  easy integration with iphone . 
the only thing to be careful of is that they are not unbreakable . 
well the phone it is worth it the extra money . 
i have owned several stick vacuums in the past . 
this was added to the grill i purchased for easier handling . 
i m still using the filtersthat came with the original unit . 
i had a frydaddy fryer that i really liked . 
i think they are well worth the money . 
voice and music comes in loud and clear . 
i m limping through with it until i choose and obtain another coffeemaker . 
these are standard sticks and work well with suckers . 
i adjusted it and it took care of the problem . 
it s rather  big in the bowl  and cumbersome . 
it would be nice if it stayed stiff . 
it fits my iphone num_extend perfectly and looks adorable . 
the smooth glass design is attractive ,  easy to clean ,  and stackable . 
bought five of this  consist black and white  num_extend
she loves being able to see the phone at that level too . 
it is completely reversible if you would need it . 
i might try a bit of super glue . 
the size and weight make the device easy to pack for travel . 
i don t really know what to say about this . 
the rubber grippers on the handles are a nice touch as well . 
this is an easy to use tortilla press . 
there are two  tricks  to using the device successfully . 
eventually after a few days i finally got them seated properly . 
i am confident it will hold up fine . 
this stylus set was a great deal ,  they were very cheap . 
well give one a try with a lid . 
a whole package of bacon almost fits on the surface . 
i etched some names and designs on this as a wedding gift . 
altho this is more of a utensil holder .  .  . its big . 
perfect for soups ,  stews ,  overnite oatmeal or hot dips . 
the plastic doesn t get dirty easily ,  despite its white color . 
this tupperware has been easy to use and clean . 
someone like me who buys these things impulsively may prefer the other brand . 
i thought it was larger than it looks . 
i think it may be better on the battery than the iphone num_extend
it will make the task of cutting a lot more pleasurable . 
it is easier to clean than others too . 
it however does not work with motorola droid . 
i have collected fiestaware dishes for almost five years now . 
when are we going to get an ethernet or wifi connection ?  . 
and it didnt take long for me to get it . 
i bought this to use on my induction cooktop . 
the plastic sides are still sort of tough to clean . 
thought they might be a little bigger ,  but work just fine . 
the rings look and fit like the previous ones . 
highly recommend it if you want a quality product !  . 
the phone itself is responsible for asking for the current . 
i tried at the beginning a small bag of  gourmet  popcorn . 
the same holds true for reheating a pizza . 
i must confess ,  i didn t read the directions . 
after num_num minutes of use i barely noticed it in my ear . 
i am especially pleased with the perfect fit . 
i initially chose cuisinart num_num month ago ,  for the durability and showmanship . 
i was a bit leary as my food processor is years old . 
this one is very sturdy and well made . 
i purchased this shortly after getting our first dyson vacuum . 
i carry in my purse without any damage whatsoever . 
but you definitely can t beat the customerservice of the otterbox !  . 
my wife can change up her case like she change her mind . 
as expected from kensington this works very well . 
i did really enjoy it when i had it . 
over all i would rate it a num_extend
plenty of oils out there just as good . 
well worth the expense i will be purchasing these again . 
this is my second version of this can opener . 
had quite a problem with amazon shipments of various fiesta plates . 
powders coffee and spices in a few seconds . 
this seems to do a better job holding a charge vs . 
can t wait to use it to make homemade ice creams !  . 
draw backs to this would be the earbud which reall sucks . 
too bad an iphone with a case cant fit on this . 
but the phone is so slippery ,  a case is a necessity . 
these would probably be excellent for camping as they weigh nothing . 
works perfectly and has a nice feel to it . 
as far as carpet vacuums go ,  this one is outstanding . 
i like it very much and am very glad i ordered it . 
it is sized just right to hold a men s dress shirt . 
which lowers the time required bake a batch of cookies . 
having a handle on both sides was a good feature ,  too . 
if this is your first screen protector then do the num_extend
they do the job ,  and are very stylish too . 
if they could make this binaural that would be even better . 
i don t know how anyone bakes anything without them . 
so for the price you can t beat it . 
out of the box ,  the knife almost feels flimsy . 
bought this for my husband s phone and it fits perfectly . 
i have owned several coffee grinders and this one has been my favorite . 
for num_num bucks and from a reliable company you can t go wrong . 
it can also be used to microwave other goods . 
they use it often to make chicken ,  and roasts . 
they mislaid it so i just got him another . 
easy enough for children to use and clean up . 
thanks to the other reviewers ,  i purchased this wonderful popper . 
it s durable and i ve had it or num_extend years without incident . 
we picked up some  but not all  clutter  and left for lunch . 
made my first call a few seconds after that . 
great product and an excellent buy for the money !  . 
i found it fit well in the hic porcelain no . 
one of the smallest i have ever seen . 
i plan on using these for many years !  !  . 
the rest of the main face is taken up by the screen . 
the general consensus is that this juicer does everything fairly well . 
in fact my coffee tastes better when made at the right temperature . 
now i need to buy me one !  lol lol . 
i have zero complaints and am very happy with the price and quality . 
i like them because they are stout and rather affordable . 
i have to work and work to get them on . 
no more putting my ear next to my gadgets to hear my music . 
great smal baker for side dishes or individual dishes . 
i d like to add that the customer service is also great . 
they are not the $ holders but do quite well with daily use . 
its transparent enough that the htc logo is visible from the num_extend
moves a lot of air for a small fan . 
your great grandchildren will be fighting over this pan someday . 
i don t use the salt part at the moment . 
these stylus work great for the price you can t beat them . 
this is a nice looking case and definitely protects the phone . 
it is light weight and easy to use . 
but ,  for the price ,  it s a pretty good kettle !  . 
for the price ,  you can t beat these protectors . 
just make sure you check that everything is still there . 
it took a couple hours to fully charge . 
now if only it were a bit easier to clean . 
the whisk is great for egg whites and making whipped cream . 
easy to apply and easy to peel off . 
i m sure i ll have this one for another num_num years . 
the vent is hidden in the handle which works perfectly . 
i definitely pushed and scrubbed harder with a normal mop . 
all in all a very useful and functional bluetooth headset . 
this screen protector is just a wee bit better than the zagg protectors . 
we purchased num_num of these for our cars . 
i purchased another different one ,  and really missed my old one . 
i haven t tried a full load on this yet . 
they also have a rubber bottom to keep them stable in the shower . 
it works !  got this thing applied first time without bubbles . 
i do not keep the mitt on the handle while cooking . 
these are cheap ,  buy in bulk and save . 
the battery choice could have used some tweaking as well . 
then my eye was drawn to the underside of the water reservoir . 
because of this ,  i purchased this krups spice and coffee grinder . 
purchased this usb cable to connect my samsung smartphone to my laptop computer . 
it hangs on a hook above my stove . 
as a result ,  she drinks an enormous amount of water . 
i m not accustomed to off the neck headphones or headsets . 
these containers keep everything fresh and are very convenient . 
it s good to have several cases to choose from . 
the extra battery charging slot is great ,  too . 
fits the handle of a cast iron pan perfectly . 
this stainless steel countertop compost keeper was purchased as a gift . 
we purchased this from amazon in num_num and have used it frequently since . 
i increased this to num_num stars for standing by their product . 
the grips on the handle are also nice . 
the rings work great to make my eggs for eggs and muffins . 
very solid feeling pot ,  as one would expect . 
i think the safety features are its  best selling point . 
there are no false touches present; only the authentic remains . 
i will probably have to order another one . 
but these lids make opening and closing the jars a cinch . 
also ,  the thickness of the ceramic helps keep its contents warmer longer . 
since it has no belts ,  it s probably a broken gear . 
built like a tank ,  great warranty ,  maximum output per turn . 
the case is easy to snap onto the phone . 
one thing; be careful not to tighten them with a heavy hand . 
the base does hold num_num egg whites at a time . 
it does what i want it to do . 
is easy to put on and take off . 
this corer does exactly what it s supposed to do easily . 
hopefully ,  i remember them next time i need some screen protectors . 
this is the first cast iron skillet i have owned . 
this is a really nice little sushi set . 
take your favorite smoothie and turn it into a smoothiecycle ! kc . 
can t beat this price for an oem blackberry car charger . 
if i do to much netflix i have to use it less . 
this is an oem motorola battery with warranty . 
it is one molded piece ,  that adds to its  durability . 
so use the one that comes with your phone . 
i also like how it rests on my ear . 
i had an oster for num_num years and it broke . 
i use this all the time so i bought num_num of them . 
that machine survived num_num years until it started to leak like crazy . 
i whisk whatever needs whisking ,  and it does the job very fast . 
when calls come in ,  i only need to touch it to answer . 
however ,  i was dissapointed to see that they were made in china . 
there is absolutely no white dust on anything when using this unit . 
they probably should made the hard case white and the silicone pink . 
ordered a second pair because my husband wanted my first set . 
but none of these cons makes me rate it down . 
this occurred when i use a real  steel  on it . 
i was excited to get this speaker phone . 
the products arrived on time in excellent condition . 
it does such a great job of slicing vegetables and making french fries . 
works good on anything from a feliet nife to a machette . 
the belt clip is not necessary to keep it protected . 
the blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor . 
never had problems with any set i received . 
i just bent the tabs down on my door and made it fit . 
if you want nice dinnerware ,  please keep moving along . 
i like this pitcher ,  it has a well fitting lid . 
it would not be good for extremely dense heavy items . 
but since we all have different needs make it adjustable . 
i was debating between purchasing a pizza stone or this pizza pan . 
it meets and exceeds the motorola standards that we all respect . 
i like to make muffins on weekends sometimes . 
a short cable should be provided with the manufacturer . 
i had the container  jump off  the base once . 
the lid stays on tight even when the soup is boiling hot . 
good quality and has failed on me yet . 
i ordered one and liked it so much i got another one . 
norpro makes a great ,  high quality product that lasts . 
note only is it beautiful but it protects my new iphone num_extend
this presto timer seemed to be what i needed . 
this product arrived when promised and in the condition promised . 
it has a little weight to it ,  which i like . 
only thing different i would do is buy a cover for it . 
how well they slide on the touch num_extend
they lock closed so are easy to store . 
i love cooking with cast iron skillets and have several . 
how amazon offers such great prices is beyond me . 
they do require some lift in your arm to use these . 
i ll definitely keep this item in mind for future needs . 
this would be the perfect vacuum for a professional wrestler . 
the reviews that knock that fact are not being fair . 
microwave popcorn has too much salt ,  preservatives ,  etc . 
i chose this model based on amazon reviews . 
i purchased num_num additional disk and it fit in there as well . 
balance didnt seem to be affected when sitting onthe counter . 
a great little strainer that is well made and easy to clean . 
typically ,  if i want something chopped ,  i chop it up small . 
i bought this chicken fryer along with some pans back in num_extend
at some point the suction cups would probably need replacing . 
it cooks fairly quickly and the fat that drains out is really gross . 
i may use the plain sheets to make lasagna soon . 
however ,  the new one heats evenly and is easy to clean . 
protects the case all around and in the back . 
why ?  because i want to use this pan for deglacage . 
 i read this on the company s site i really like this case . 
this potato ricer is a very sturdy ,  dependable product . 
its great product and no problem at all nothing !  . 
i feel this one has the fewest cons and is the best product . 
i like it that this is really strong . 
a removable clip with a strong hold ?  perfect for so many things . 
we like the grips more than anything else . 
she uses them with all her blue tooth things . 
how much can you say about a can opener . 
i purchased this pan as a gift for my children for christmas . 
i didn t find the handle so hot i needed a pot holder . 
that s not an issue for me but it might be for some . 
it isn t as high quality as this towel holder . 
one side is labeled num_extend and the other is labeled num_extend
so far i ve managed not to break anything . 
 they literally have to be soaked with wet paper towels .   . 
i just love my new pots and pans . 
of course you can still use the magnetic pick up with this also . 
only con is that it is incredibly loud . 
i cannot be happier with the quality and durability of this case . 
just remember to watch your very first batch . 
that means there s more than num_num latches on the pan . 
neither came close to the quality this screen protector provides . 
we have had no problems with this ice cream maker . 
i got one when i purchased my current htc phone in num_extend
we have very hard water and that s probably adding to the situation . 
jabra makes fine products :  stylish and well built . 
this works well for cleaning shrimp ,  as advertised . 
i have recommended it to my friends already . 
works perfectly for burgers and other grilled meats . 
one is the num_num which sells for about $
for the price it should last a lifetime . 
fits fine in the misc kitchen drawer and the wood handle stays cool . 
i bought two of these when they were on sale for $
a plug like this in a store would be ten bucks or more . 
i like how the knives are identified on the bottom . 
so ,  i gave it to my kid starting up his new house . 
so ,  i purchased it and it was great . 
this is actually the second one of these i ve owned . 
the fabric this case is constructed from wipes clean with a damp cloth . 
i was intrigued by the fiber mesh construction at the tip . 
has make simple work of the stuff i tried so far . 
so as far as i m concerned i love it . 
i got this as a gift for my mom . 
i have no problem at all connecting these to my iphone and ipad . 
i bought these back in num_extend and still use them every day . 
i still decided to use the one provided . 
the pot heats up quickly and cleans easily . 
if you have expensive ,  quality china ,  you need to buy these . 
i ordered this and it gets a decent rating for the price . 
also love how much i save on popcorn now . 
doing this will help keep the paper pulp taste out of your coffee . 
they are easy to handle and work great on the kindle fire . 
my advice is to use the clips to hold a thing . 
i like that it truly wraps around the phone . 
when used properly this works well with the thermapen . 
this forum is to review the actual product . 
so this set is just right for me . 
you can also hang it on a door . 
great to dry delicate pices of clothing in home . 
you can make it thin  like a smoothie  or thick . 
i was thrilled to see this and bought one right away . 
don t try cooking an egg as your first test lol . 
yet it might be if you have a wider grate tray than mine . 
we used it on all of our phones . 
this is the standard by which grill and griddle pans should be measured . 
this mortar and pestle is the best mortar out there . 
i prefer a switch rather than holding a button . 
mind you ,  i am a very gentle user . 
if they could go in the microwave ,  they would be perfect !  . 
it works great for my daugher s ipod touch . 
there are a few but they are expensive or pugly looking . 
this was also ordered for my other granddaughter . 
the back leaves the apple logo exposed but recessed to avoid scratching . 
this is one area where i think they ve nailed it . 
i  , m looking forward to my next kitchenaid mixer . 
since cuisinart is top of the line ,  i chose this model . 
the battery works great and holds charge fine . 
great to cover jars of pickles or other acidic contents . 
similar to a table saw kicking out lumber back at you . 
flash drives work as well ,  which is surprising . 
it s good to see him enjoying the phone . 
i highly recommend it as well as all the multiclad line . 
well recommended . i hope this was helpful to you . 
i have been using this product for about num_num weeks now . 
the cloth is very helpful in keep the protection clean . 
the unit includes one filter and a replacement reminder sheet for the fridge . 
i owned a num_extend qt kitchenaid mixer for a little over a year . 
it s always a hit at parties and clean up is a breeze . 
i love it !  it fits perfectly and looks good . 
this is the reason for the small board . 
that was the main reason i purchased it . 
compared to the a same size num_extend num_extend phone  ex . 
it works effectively on my back up batteries to my phone . 
i happend to see this same unit at local grocery store today for $
i kept a few for my self and have a few away . 
this little grinder rips through those hard spices in num_num to num_num seconds . 
great device to keep in your car in case of num_extend
i needed a metal one for hot liquids . 
i m sure i ll be buying more once i run out again . 
the num_num is ,  by far ,  the best option . 
this was a gift for my hairdresser who is also quite a baker . 
this is the best ice cream scoop i ve ever seen . 
it can handle anything you can think of blending . 
they re also under $ nothing wrong with them . 
was a bit short for needs but still works great !  . 
case has unique smell to it when you notice it at first . 
i have two peelers and use them constantly . 
it is one single piece so there is nothing to break or misplace . 
when you spin this gizmo doesn t even walk on you . 
where you set num_num fan pilling air and the other pushing air out . 
loud enough ,  no clicks or pops  ,  and num_extend comfort . 
it is not hot on the bottom so that s no problem . 
i make sure my knives are completely dry before storing them in it . 
could not find my receipt and could therefore not replace it . 
needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime . 
i do let it raise twice ,  because i can . 
this is what i did with this board . 
every application ,  even num_extend party ones ,  work this way . 
it fits the itouch num_extend generation perfectly and is a simple design . 
i m trying to decide on kneading in the kitchenaid vs . 
this can allow a very small amount of grounds escape confinement while plunging . 
it all comes in a box about the size of a briefcase . 
it s title is  petite .  .  .   and it is just that . 
the popped corn is better than that from a microwave . 
they just needed to be replaced once per month or less . 
i just wanted to get something that apparently nobody makes . 
smartest move i ever made !  no need now for more burners . 
i like the selection of covers as well . 
very good price also ,  i would recommend buying . 
it is quieter than my hoover vac by far . 
but it is something that i will use for quite some time . 
i have owned kitchenaid products for over num_num years . 
the plastic was cloudy and obscured the contents of the dish . 
the removable cap that can easily be lost isn t my favorite . 
also comes with a small pouch to store everything in . 
just press and hold and siri gets activated . 
i cannot recommend these knives highly enough ,  especially for everyday cooking . 
the mouths are open wide and the seals are good . 
i could not find a single store that carried these . 
i knew i wasn t going to get let down . 
like any container for coffee ,  it may get build up over time . 
i had been looking for a good bluetooth headset for work . 
for the cost ,  this is the best i ve found for these . 
i have had a presto power pop popper for many years ,  now . 
food cooks so much better and stay warm for so long . 
used it to shred up a bunch of zucchini for zuccini bread . 
this little think is perfect for what i needed . 
we recently replaced our humidifier with this model . 
i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it . 
a winner as recommended by americas test kitchen . 
this is actually the second honeywell air purifier that i ve purchased . 
hangs on the back of the bedroom door . 
i had another one just like this and it last num_num years . 
one draw back is the plastic window part . 
makes great coffee ,  no grounds in my cup . 
the many colors make it very easy to accessorize your table . 
i m writing this review almost a year later . 
it has since turned into an indispensable part of my kitchen . 
the oxo easily opens cans of all sizes in a flash . 
very pleased with its quality and with this purchase . 
maybe that is all it was designed to do . 
some bubbling of course ,  but not too bad . 
i make my own recipes and don t bother with envelope mixes . 
if i need another one i ll get this one again . 
the mixer is well built and well designed . 
i received the slicer and realized i could do so much more with num_extend
i like it as itis one piece and fits well on my counter . 
i have num_num of these scoops ,  small ,  medium and large . 
coffee cups are standard . that s just about the set ,  though . 
i bought mine at verizon so i paid way too much . 
much sturdier than the picture makes it look . 
i bought this for my father and he absolutely loves it . 
love making my own pasta since taking a class last summer . 
i recommend this phone to anyone who wants an android . 
have had since fall num_extend no problems so far . 
cheap price ,  delivered to my door and works as advertised . 
when i d really need a headset like this is on the road . 
love how long this is ,  it was fantastic . 
they are exactly what they say they are . 
worth paying a few extra bucks i would think . 
when they arrived ,  i told him to put one on . 
it was only $ so maybe it won t work worth a darn . 
but then maybe i m just a weird dude . 
and over num_num years later ,  mine are just getting broken in . 
i take it whenever i can when i travel !  . 
works great was easy to use and great direction . 
this could be quite confusing for a first time multimedia phone user . 
now ,  i don t open a dozen cans a day . 
a good quality saucepot at a wonderful price . 
after i ordered this i ll find someone that could use it . 
i haven t found anything to gripe about ,  i m totally satisfied . 
i buy them all the time to make bling cases . 
the pan is heavy duty and has a lovely design . 
a bit pricey but hope that they will last a long time . 
would give num_num stars if it had num_num usb plugs . 
this is the best car mount ever that fits almost any smart phone . 
friends who dont have screen protectors have not been as lucky . 
a water filter reduces chlorine and prevents calcification . 
no problem with the stone arriving in one piece . 
my kids love homemade potato chips and my previous option was a mandolin . 
to do so ,  i purchased the oxo softworks meat tenderizer . 
makes a very impressive cookie or pie crust that is deceptively num_extend
the handle is strong and has not warped on the fire . 
i can make my eggs in peace now . 
rosemarie is a quiet pattern that really sets off a setting . 
if you don t do this every time ,  it will rust . 
the quality and elegence of this press is unrivaled in its own right . 
i think this one will last much longer . 
it sticks on pretty firm as well ,  so it won t loosen . 
i like to carry a spare battery for my cellphone . 
the bubbles were easy to get out that formed under the screen . 
i seasoned both pans according to another reviewer s instructions . 
works with white potatoes as well as sweet . 
this mixer is by far the best out there . 
purchased this to keep a broscilate tea pot warm on the stove . 
it s a minor flaw that can be ignored for the price . 
i put the yogurt in and put in the fridge . 
and it is much easier to apply than greasing and flouring . 
this popcorn popper pops as quickly as the manufacturer says . 
i wanted this for making big batches of stuff . 
i m looking forward to those camp meals ,  tho . 
the problem is that the battery that came with it is worthless . 
its very easy to remove and and put in phone into case . 
then ,  using a wooden utensil ,  get the ice cream out . 
used it on some chicken breasts and they came out well . 
that aside it does work just as well charging my ipod . 
vertically i don t see that it would be a problem . 
for them this would be an excellent product . 
i don t see myself ever buying the individual bags again . 
i got it out of the box and used the enclosed recipe . 
it is a fantastic purchase for the price . 
i do like the holder that comes with it . 
in particular the steel spatula is pretty heavy duty and well built . 
the device arrived partially charged at a little under halfway . 
i purchased two ,  one for me and one for my husband . 
never owned a dutch oven before but have friends with it . 
for the price ,  it was a no brainer for me . 
i would recommend buying a screen protector with it as well . 
loved it so much that i bought one for my beach house . 
with the plantronics i can ramble away and she hears me clearly . 
i truly think they save on cleaning the coffee pot every other week . 
amazon shipping was fast and cuispro quality is great . 
other than that ,  it does what it should . 
over all though its a great case for the money . 
this functions just as well if not better than a normal whisk . 
it s easy to use and easy to clean . 
it keeps the tea very hot for long time . 
this is the cutest dutch oven and so functional . 
i bought this food processor almost on a whim . 
needed an extra skillet and this one works just fine . 
recieved it quickly ,  but drains just as fast in this phone . 
at this price ,  it isn t a huge risk . 
i am not professional to sharpen our knifes . 
these gloves work very well with my iphone num_extend
frankly i never had a issue with it . 
i plan to pick those up from the hardware store and add them . 
it is sturdy and comes in different colors . 
lodge is still better than most foreign imports . 
generally set phone on exercise machine or on floor so rarely occurs . 
it is like a razr num_extend with a full qwerty . 
we have used a brita pitcher for about num_num years . 
the touch pad control is pretty simple to use although not entirely intuitive . 
this angled measuring cup is so much easier to read . 
hence it only gives you the option to hold it with one hand . 
i don t mind that it doesn t have a lid . 
also ,  food looks very pleasing and appetizing in the beautiful glass containers . 
i ve been brewing coffee for decades in a chemex coffee pot . 
this strainer is large enough and filters well enough to do this task . 
this is one sharp knife ,  right out of the package . 
i use this antenna inside my rv near a window . 
the  shot glass  description on these is way off . 
it cooks perfectly evenly and distributes heat throughout . 
when i got this one ,  i was amazed at the difference . 
it s quite large ,  so easily holds two cups of grain . 
the only can opener you llever own once you use it . 
first let me say that i am extremely fussy . 
i ll buy more of these as they are the best !  . 
i tried to make my own and had poor results . 
i tried a $ air popper from target and it was almost worthless . 
the feel of the case is light and silky . 
instead it expands beautifully for a great rich foam . 
i purchased this to use my iphone in my car . 
it does what it should do and is built very very well . 
i can hear people very well and they can hear me . 
it worked perfectly allowing her to watch videos without a wire . 
if you like chrome cases ,  this is an excellent case . 
it s minor ,  that s why i m sticking with num_num stars . 
my wife was very impressed with that one touch rewinding the wire feature . 
this case is more of a rigid silicone but it is still protective . 
still ,  for the cost ,  it s a great choice . 
it is the  cadillac  of pressure cookers !  i really enjoy it . 
all in all i m please with this cover . 
i personally was sceptical because of the price num_extend dollars !   . 
when you follow the directions the results are sumptuous andquite healthy to boot . 
no sticking ,  no under cooking ,  perfect bundt shape and crusting . 
everything you need to start making some great mozzarella . 
the installation method though is a bit tedious at best . 
the cleaning is really not too bad once you get used to it . 
enough for a family ,  i would think . i have two gripes . 
i love that you can take them apart for easier cleaning . 
it makes fabulous popcorn if you use white popcorn . 
i didn t think i would need a skimmer . 
it has a nice little sleeve to keep it in too . 
i love these for single servings of fish ,  never any frost bite . 
first one wore out because of a plastic part in the grinding mechanism . 
a nice cordless can opener but be aware it has to be charged . 
limited kitchen storage space prompted me to look at pot racks . 
i love my new acrylic cook book holder . 
from spreading fruits  blueberries  for freezing to baking cookies or pizza . 
this feature is what edges out the prime . 
really beautiful ,  like a cathedral in a delicate soft snow . 
i use it from time to time ,  it is ok . 
got it for preparing food for my dehydrator . 
doesn t add any bulk to my phone which i love . 
i ll be ordering the smaller size next for smaller cookies . 
the three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air . 
so i took it and it was so easy ,  moveable and adjustable . 
uniform cut thickness is an easy function of this knife . 
it s kept my products fresh and usable for a reasonable price . 
you ll see what i mean if you have the product in hand . 
it is not an amazing device for a great price . 
you can see the kernels all jumping up and down in the hopper . 
i have been using my kaiser springform pan for several years . 
when i gave it to him he was so delighted . 
it makes the creamiest rice pudding you could ever make . 
i really like the newer shape of this . 
this was highly recommended by the folks at america s test kitchen . 
we use this mainly for making pancakes ,  it really rocks at that . 
but after reading the product comments i decided to give it a try . 
outer hard shell ,  inner soft glove design fits exceptionally well . 
like buying premium gas ,  ,  ,  ,  you don t need it . 
the blades are sharp and tough; they have a rockwell hardness score of num_extend
i ve been fighting with my grill pan since i got it . 
the nonstick coating is also the nicest and most durable i ve used . 
i even use its ample flat surface for steaming . 
and at last ,  they are pretty sharp for cheap knife . 
we eat three times as much rice as we did before . 
this does a great job of julienning almost any vegetable . 
great for soups and sauces easy to clean . 
i also like the fact that it s not too cumbersome to use . 
exactly what i wanted and expected and at a great price . 
the big drawback for me is that the edges need to be sanded . 
on a whim ,  i decided to try it on my iphone . 
it s an excellent stockpot and will serve well for a lifetime . 
i use these for the handles on all my logic cast iron ware . 
it tends to go on and off pretty easily . 
i do like this filter over the brita filter too . 
the nokia num_num is more fun than a blackberry . 
however be aware that the num_extend generation ipad will not charge with it . 
i have a few other simplehuman items in my kitchen area . 
unlike some serving dishes ,  fiestaware cannot survive even moderate impact . 
but the jawbone num_num had certain things going for it that i miss . 
it really moves the air and is very quiet . 
my wife loves to use this to make apple cider . 
it has a plastic top coat to keep spills from going through . 
however ,  the steaming wand takes a star away from this machine . 
i have no problem with the size of the bowls . 
easy to clean ,  takes up very little space . 
this provide a very economic way to make your own yogurt . 
this device seems to handle that pretty well . 
it has gone up $ in the past week . 
however ,  the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup . 
but with this gizmo ,  i can julienne veggies in a flash . 
it was handy to use in an emergency though . 
they are certainly better than the standard apple earphones . 
thanks amazon for including such a quality product in your line up !  . 
they worked just fine and made it very affordable . 
she has an htc sensation and i now have the iphone num_extend
as regards the price ,  i have purchased two of these num_extend
cause if not i would haven t experienced this marviolious work of wonder . 
makes just the right amount for a single serving or two . 
i only wish it was a little bit larger . 
i dont care that this makes my phone look bulky . 
the cover is used after the first five minutes . 
it is well made and constructed to last . 
this is the first trackball i purchased when she lost her original trackball . 
thank you so much for a lovely case . 
i ordered two of these boards and really enjoy them . 
excellent replacement to my old carafe without replacing my entire coffee maker . 
great little device if u r on the go . 
it is nice and stable ,  hasn t fallen on its own yet . 
the pan got here really fast and we used it the first night . 
this is the best wine opener i have ever used . 
you don t cook spaghetti in a spaghetti strainer . 
the first machine we had ,  everything was burnt . 
the cheese was oozing and the outside had a nice crunch . 
have had a problem with plastic basters as they always cracked . 
i use these every day ,  and love them . 
almost non stick when seasoned and this one came already seasoned . 
this steamer does a great job for moderately wrinkled clothes . 
this little guy is awesome for home or traveling . 
these ,  however ,  with the oval shape ,  sneak right in . 
i use it to make bread and pizza . 
i left ,  came home ,  and they were still playing music . 
we use it nightly and as a white noise generator . 
thumb and middle with the index over top  . 
i already owned one of these units when i bought this second one . 
i m connected to minimizing the harm done to our planet . 
roomba is one of the greatest conveniences to come to my home . 
for almost every other device this little sleek fellow should suit you perfectly . 
case is nice and solid ,  easy to put on and take off . 
this scoop is easy to use ,  comfortable ,  and produced great results . 
but any microwave steamer meant for veggies has this same problem . 
most cooks will get by just fine with the num_num inch utility knife . 
i am very impressed with the foamy froth produced by this small appliance . 
it does not have the made in china stamp on it . 
this armband is good for small and large arms . 
the wusthof knives are the best in my humble opinion . 
i think amazon has the best price on both of these . 
easy to use and clean and keeps coffee hot long time . 
it s not very long but long enough for normal charging purposes . 
there are four different buttons ,  two being a `rocker  profile . 
it draws just num_extend when powered by two nimh cells num_extend
i prefer a one piece charging cable i bought as a num_extend
i can fry an egg on low and it comes out perfect . 
i only wish i would have purchased one years ago . 
very sturdy case ,  feels like the phone is well protected . 
i hand wash ,  but the pan is dishwasher safe . 
i downloaded another app and now i have voice command . 
so i am very satisfied with my headset . thank you !  . 
when the covers get dusty i just toss them in the washing machine . 
it is light weight and has good volume levels and battery life usage . 
with any other silicone case though ,  this happens as well . 
no feedback ,  no static at all and the volume button worked perfectly . 
they lose their oompf after about num_num oz . 
i own many of the cuisinart pots and pans . 
the sheets are very easy to clean with a rough sponge . 
i bought this for the wife to use in her car . 
connect your headphones or speakers inside the audio port . 
this might work better for a dryer batter . 
now i am adding my voice to theirs . 
it does everything it s supposed to without any problems . 
this thing keeps your phone extra safe ,  and fits the phone great . 
i needed num_num replacement parts  which were broken  . 
i would definitely recommend it and it comes in a ton of colors . 
seems a shame to throw it out if you re straining yogurt . 
easy to switch between vacuuming and using the attachments ,  too . 
i only wish it was a bit larger . 
i had used toothpicks to test my cakes for years . 
i can see at a glance the amount of ingredients i have . 
this is the last coffee maker i will buy . 
my husband told me to get it for my birthday . 
the taste did not change and the temperature was perfectly hot . 
good balance and construction ,  especially for the price . 
i use it a lot for leftover soups from home ,  too . 
as others have stated ,  don t bother with the included strainer . 
looks nice !  ought to protect against any pests and well as dust . 
it is smooth and cuts the lid off well . 
you really can t go wrong for the price . 
actually got these for use as kitchen shears . 
i have used this product for many years . 
i have had my droid too long not to be using this product . 
the batteries fit inside the phone perfectly and last a long time . 
this is a very good product for the price . 
it is pretty durable so far no problems . 
my only disappointment was they were made in china vs . 
if used properly ,  it conserves wine for days !  . 
for the price ,  you really can t beat  em . 
i also use it to cook other stuff . 
upgraded to the  professional  series for the metal frame . 
this is the third umbra flip hook that we have purchased . 
i just bought this for my husband s birthday and he loves it . 
that leaves you with a total of num_num pairs . 
metal changes when it heats ,  that s just the way it is . 
 not perfect if you dont have a carpet and use the carpet pins  . 
this is a great way to steam corn in the microwave . 
said it s the best thing i every got for her . 
bacon is a mess ,  but it is on anything . 
the light appropriately glows when the unit is charging and charging a phone . 
i recommend starting from the middle and slowly working out from there . 
great for when i m out and need to charge the ipod . 
there was num_num problems i had with it . 
it looks great on my counter and tost s bread to perfection . 
i did think it was a little darker but it s fine . 
from plug in to make num_num cups of coffee . 
currently ,  do not have any issues with this product . 
i feel like they should put this with my ashes when i die . 
we don t really buy the big cans of soup . 
once hot though ,  you can bake one waffle right after another . 
i also think the finish is easier to clean than in past models . 
each sheet holds about num_num cups of liquid . 
usually a little mrs meyers does a great job . great investment piece . 
it took a little time and it s actually super easy to use . 
the mixer arrived sealed in the factory box . 
you see ,  neither the num_extend nor num_extend come with a dsi adapter . 
we love the set ,  and are very happy with it . 
purchased this case in conjunction with the seidio extended battery . 
this cabinet looks nice ,  but isn t extremely sturdy . 
well i am still hooked on four star . 
and sprays cold water just like a hose . 
i purchased this to work with my waterproof case . 
this press works really well and is very easy to clean . 
they come apart easily and are are easy to clean . 
i got the basic idea and was lucky that it worked num_extend
in fact it s perfect size for typing on . 
i purchased a unlocked nokia num_extend and was back in the nokia fold . 
i have three of these racks and use them everytime i bake . 
i ordered a few to keep my homemade water and milk kefir in . 
most cannot believe i am on a device at all . 
spatula came as expected with a nice wooden grip . 
these are real good ,  easy to put on . 
i love the blue light in the charger . 
you can release the lever on the cup and it still stays stuck . 
it s a small slider ,  but serves the purpose . 
again ,  it s just a matter of reading the instructions . 
my kitchenaid stand mixer is num_num years young and works like new . 
took out only the area we wanted without chopping into the flowers . 
it fits great and she did fall in love with it . 
purchased these for my wife and she loves them . 
it looks nice on the counter ,  goes with everything . 
this is an ideal screen protector for the droid x . 
i just love it and so will my daughter . 
the number given in the magazine was different . 
at that point ,  i would have given it num_num stars . 
i have yet to see any filter remnants in the water . 
but they re sturdy and have just the right feel . 
this is one of the best car chargers i have used thus far . 
wanted these for storage ,  not for preserving food . 
i ve had absolutely no problems with this toaster . 
reset itself when it cooled down ,  nice safety feature . 
the company is excellent at standing behind them also . 
it s super well made and super easy to clean . 
the small vibration is due to slow air buildup across hepa filter . 
case lasted a while without fading or peeling . 
they are small and so not easily seen . 
i find myself using it more often than expected . 
finger tight means just that and the glass can handle it . 
i ve never cared what temperature my food is . 
the tool is easy to control ,  and a snap to use . 
it is an oem battery for the bold num_extend
do suggest getting the tip cleaning tool in addition . 
also it is not as big as some of the newer foreman . 
i took off a star because the plastic gels feel a bit weird . 
this is emptied by simply unplugging two plastic plugs . 
the devices recognized the power source right away and started charging . 
i would have to look at the manual . 
both of them seem to filter the water just fine . 
i have used it and i love it . 
generally have enjoyed the grind n brew over the past num_num months . 
its very good for cleaning tight places ,  especially cars . 
these glasses are great as your regular drinking glass . 
fiestaware is as practical as it is beautiful . 
i thought was going to be cheap and break easy . 
great screen protectors ,  they came on time and just as described . 
if anything ,  this device has dulled my own knife skills . 
i have been and still very happy with this purchase . 
i like the kitchen shears in this set . 
it is a good case ,  and fit pretty well in my phone . 
i use it to grind herbs as well as coffee . 
this demanding cook could not be more pleased . 
it cleans up very well most of the time . 
this was exactly what i was looking for . 
love it and plan to get one of these for my future phones . 
i feel much more comfortable operating the phone with one hand . 
i keep coffee and other things in it . 
can cook ,  freeze ,  microwave and store food in them . 
this backup is a nice size for portability . 
this cable works great ,  even with my underpowered usb ports . 
the phone that works for me has to be a workhorse . 
it s also pretty lightweight ,  making it very comfortable to wear . 
this one works out well for smaller portions and smaller cuts of meat . 
with the iphone num_num there was no exception . 
this allows me to swap out the two batteries that i purchased . 
it works very well ,  will take up to num_num cups of flour . 
no problems noted as of yet with this product . 
we have used it quite a few times with great results . 
it fits like a glove and very substantial . 
this small thing packs a lot of power . 
its definitely an eye catcher ,  and quite adorable . 
we ve had it for num_num wks now and really like it . 
very versatile and i was using it in multiple vehicles . 
compared to other grinders i have owned this is the best overall . 
i am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone . 
tricky to get on but they all are . 
it feels like it was made from recycled plastic parts from other merchandise . 
this is a very good product and will keep on purchasing it . 
i ve been using this mill for about a year now . 
other than that ,  the color is awesome and the case is phenomenal . 
the magnets on this are strong enough to hold probably any towel up . 
for the price ,  it is just an amazing cellphone . 
otherwise i really like it and would highly recommend . 
this fan is not as quiet and there is a very good reason . 
i make the standard white bread recipe they offer with % success . 
the price on amazon is about half what it is in retail stores . 
we take it with us on trips wherever we go . 
simply turn the shelves over every few months . 
and now ,  i m ordering a couple of them for christmas gifts . 
but the battery only requires recharging once every three or four weeks . 
it works great to grind my morning coffee . 
upright handles make the pan easier to lift . 
needless to say ,  i miss a lot of calls while i drive . 
used this pan for several different batters without leaks . 
this one so far has sliced well and is easier to clean . 
excellent little knife to use in all my silicon coated pans . 
they clean up easily and heat seems to be distributed well . 
the curved handle makes it easy to use . 
they are pricey ,  but they do save in waste . 
quickly becoming one of my favorite most used devices . 
you turn your telephone on and activate bluetooth connections . 
seems to hold up well and is dishwasher safe . 
otterbox provide several great cases and this hybrid case is no exception . 
i bought the num_extend screen protectors for iphone . 
if your knives are like mine ,  they re heavy and sharp . 
the call quality is pretty good ,  and reception is better than average . 
i ordered this because my moto q global stopped charging . 
the carafe is extremely well built and feels good to hold and pour . 
never had one fail on me even when running at rated capacity . 
then it was repacked again in another box . 
i replaced a different small desktop tower type fan with this one . 
there is just one not so trivial problem . 
one of those i purchased lasted one block of cheese . 
i have used it for cooking bacon and was happy with the results . 
the lids are dishwasher safe  top rack  and never rust . 
this top fits fine in a standard saucepan . 
the otterbox forces you to use its built in screen protector . 
it also lends itself to a retro look . 
everything is designed so well to perform its function . 
bought num_num of these shelf organizers and they have worked great . 
a few organic beans at your local grocery is likely to run $
it works but pick ups a lot of wind noise . 
it protects my samsung captivate and gives it a stylish look . 
it is so worth spending a few extra dollars to get crystal film . 
i was so happy to find these tortilla bowl makers . 
if you have a standard microwave this will undoubtedly impress you . 
i love the camera ,  takes great photos ,  the flash is functional . 
i have to say this exceeded my expectations . 
i can easily go num_extend hours on the built in battery . 
these bowls are beautiful and wash well in the dishwasher . 
it s wider and will hold more silverware ,  plus it s compartmentalized . 
set the temp at num_num degrees on the controller dial . 
in everything i do ,  i expect them to perform . 
the lid is also a bit shaky ,  but conveniently heavy . 
noisy as heck when it comes to steaming the milk . 
one port is for iphones and the other for android . 
it gives you the freedom to move around . 
we are going to love this item for a long time . 
this is great for making melon balls or scooping out an apple core . 
the little pull tab is ingenious and seems durable  so far  . 
it does exactly what it is designed to do . 
a lot of case will make the phone bigger than what it is . 
the toast function is very reliable and provides even toasting on both sides . 
a must when removing a hot skillet from the oven . 
i do have cereal in them and it works just fine . 
i could never tell when to use  frappe  instead of  crush  anyway . 
so this waffle for $ bucks was a great price . 
the only potential problem is if you carry your phone is a case . 
thanks to the astro num_extend i am not concerned . 
i like the little box it came in ,  still using it today . 
this car charger works for several different cell phones that we have . 
like it as it has even heat and clean up is easy . 
my family prefers rolls so i mostly use it for the dough cycle . 
the hard plastic clear cases do not offer proper protection . 
the display cannot accidently slide open while in the holster . 
anyone looking at this product should go ahead and buy it . 
the knife came out with nicks all over the blade . 
i would definitely recommend this whisk to anyone . 
and by saying  answer  or  ignore  ,  the call is connected or not . 
it s fine for the price for a quick froth . 
great product and i am glad that i found this item . 
we ve used this a couple of times already and it works well . 
the smaller containers are not too small to carry anything significant . 
now only if i can find a charger . 
dust ,  lint ,  sand in your pocket ?  hairline scratch galore . 
after some research i finally decided to buy this power bank . 
most importantly ,  they help you avoid plastic which leeches chemicals into food . 
it grinds really fine and fairly quickly ,  too . 
this thing is supposed to pop corn with hot air . 
it really hurts my wrists a lot and i m num_extend and strong . 
the screen is not large ,  but it isn t small either . 
pressing the button near the leds would not do anything . 
it is nice not having cords hanging around all the time . 
hardly anyone goes to the store to buy one for themselves . 
i often forget this and burn my espresso . 
it was kind of hard pulling the iphone in there . 
they needed a basic phone but with a keyboard to make texting easier . 
i purchased these knives to replace another brand that i was unhappy with . 
i think this is an very nice tool to have . 
i actually just ordered a second rectangle one . 
it doesn t steam for all that long ,  but is easily refilled . 
it has my chopping so much easier for me . 
it works as expected and is a good value . 
had to replace after some time because got slick ,  would use again . 
there is even room for my small stylus . 
it is a good value for the money spent . 
i would highly recommend this phone to anyone that enjoys apple devices . 
they are packaged well with a piece of thick cardboard backing . 
makes a ton of noise so people leave the room . 
it s a nice complement to my other coffee making devices . 
then i coated it a couple more times . 
i have to have my coffee very hot . 
all in all it was a great purchase for the price . 
so i have num_num days to check it out . 
just tip it to drain the bowl first then clean the well area . 
it cleans up in the dishwasher just fine also . 
the hand held grater is a great choice for what i grate . 
and do not have easy access to a charger . 
two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy . 
this one is great . never be without one again . 
new batteries in once or twice a year . 
i aimed a little more carefully on the second clove ,  and voila . 
the lids fit tightly and they store in the cabinet easily . 
i keep the one at home on my nightstand by my alarm clock . 
i put the big ,  bulky shoes on the bottom rack . 
well made ,  i love the cloudy white instead of clear . 
the auto shut off feature is a great feature . 
there s definitely an art to getting it to froth quickly . 
we liked it enough to order another one . 
very easy to replace and would recommend if replacing parts in your phone . 
the juice pack battery is preferentially used over the internal iphone battery . 
also bought one for my daughter who has a houseful all the time . 
she usually oils the inside of the ring to prevent sticking . 
the only question is how it will hold up over time . 
when i found it on amazon ,  i bought it immediately . 
bought these when i bought my coffee maker ,  both from amazon . 
i would more than highly reccomend this oven to everyone out there . 
the handle feels like cheap plastic and is the only negative . 
i called them and within a day the problem had been resolved . 
i am set for over a year now . 
not what a knife is supposed to be used for . 
it s not a smooth feel like a regular screen . 
saw a review of  cooking string  types on america s test kitchen . 
i have been caught several times using it and running out of batteries . 
i have been using this kind of filter for years . 
most people are impressed when i pull them out of the freezer . 
the case properly protects the iphone from sweat and detrius . 
i have used the bags and they are fine . 
moved off heat ,  covered pot for num_num num_extend
no big kettle and hot water to deal with . 
the blue air machine how ever is not quite up to par . 
now i see that they are much more useful than i thought . 
when charging my ipad it seems like it took forever . 
this will also work on a grill for camping . 
it s a very affordable work horse ,  making cup after cup . 
charging flap can be tricky sometimes ,  but not a big deal . 
no exaggeration ,  you cannot go wrong with this battery . 
minor pain ,  but the split shipping was worth the cheaper overall cost . 
cannot find anything with the same quality for the price . 
secondly ,  this coffee grinder grinds your coffee beans to a coarse grind . 
belt clip is great to have; less crap in my pocket . 
would recommend this roaster for anyone loving roasted chicken . 
i switched back to the num_extend at lunch . 
the original ,  baked enamel finish on this skillet works great . 
so that s why i also got the num_extend
it is so easy to use and works all the time . 
the adjustment dials are very easy to use . 
the feet on the bottom of the board keep it from slipping . 
the range is as good as any headset . 
this case fits perfectly for my droid x cell phone . 
she s had it for years ,  and it s still going strong . 
i like it better than the plastic or aluminum ones they sell . 
it pours easily and is easy to wash . 
i use it daily for smoothies using frozen fruit and ice . 
it pops really well leaving very few kernels . 
i gave my housekeeper my old classic one . 
the vacu vin keeps the wine fresh for a longer period of time . 
the muted colors of fruit and floral design are very attractive . 
it is simply designed easy to put together . 
i like the fact that the case comes with a screen protecter . 
i bet he won t buy accessories from the sprint store again . 
i will never give this mixer up it s great for everything . 
this one does it all and does it perfectly . 
packaging was in bubble wrap and i had no problem . 
so i bought the batteries as a gift . 
awesome charger !  i ve had zero problems with these things . 
item was shipped quickly and arrived as described . 
i keep items that i use frequently and find it wonderfully convenient . 
we used the griddle for pancakes and it works great . 
i m not going to get into too much detail here . 
wait for the orange heating light to go out . 
this unit s bowl already shows fracturing as did my old popper . 
the color is great and the glasses are fine . 
just place it on and you re good to go . 
recently my husband and i upgraded most of our small appliances and cookware . 
it is built alright and works as intended . 
and the pen is so smooth and useful . 
it is often a topic of conversation with it s unique styling . 
i will recommend this as a great buy . 
believe me i know good steel when i use it . 
i decided to keep this product because i love it ,  love it . 
however to each their own on that one . 
i ll definitely purchase several to hold different types of oil . 
i reflected on problems i had with the hamilton beach . 
this is a snazzy looking case that fits the samsung galexy num_extend perfectly . 
this is the perfect size spatula for me . 
belt holster can hold phone screen  in   against clip  or screen  out  visible . 
i saw this one with a great price to replace my spare . 
i would expect this ,  since it is not made for playing music . 
i used these under my sink and in one of my narrow cabinets . 
the chraging time isn t bad at all for an extended battery . 
sometimes a video is faster than a book . 
it is very well designed and made of rugged materials . 
items arrived quickly and happy with the change . 
from what i have been told ,  these work great . 
this is a great pressure canner at a very economical price . 
but the quality is there nonetheless and the grip is very good . 
even the most expensive still produced just a sandwich . 
this is by far one of my favorite purchases for my kitchen . 
they also won t mount in some docking stations with the case on . 
we use it daily and leave water in it all the time . 
this could be the phone or the headset . 
now i have greek yogurt from straining my ordinary yogurt . 
as always wilton products are well made and designed . 
will have to sacrifice that and use the case supplied with this kit . 
this is the standard samsung oem car charger . 
it looks professional and is easy to use . 
i use these with an old popcorn popper my parents had for years . 
lastly yes there is no hole cut out over the front camera . 
it arrived in the two day shipping as promised . 
a case that protects your phone from oopsies on the ground . 
so we used it when we couldn t find a regular thermometer . 
we use this more than any other cooking item we have . 
with no doubt ,  must have item for every house . 
it came promptly and arrived in a sealed packaging . 
audio quality is fair and could use improvement . 
this shaker has worked very well for me . 
i noticed that the box itself looked nothing like the amazon photo . 
cool for daytime i guess ,  but really excessively bright at night !  . 
it did not taste like the original english muffins . 
we already had a set from years back . 
i had to opt for this one because i have a num_extend
in fact ,  it will fall off if not held in place . 
i received this at no cost through the amazon vine program . 
with the force of an executioner i slammed the hammer down . 
guaranteed to be your most useful kitchen appliance . 
it comes with num_num different sizes of soft silicon ear buds . 
i use it every day and couldn t live without it . 
no special twisting or unscrewing or having wires attached . 
the salton s lid comes off too easily for me ,  too . 
they are also great for normal headset use and for cell phone use . 
excellent ,  size perfect !  nice space saving for our counter . 
i really like the matte finish ,  which reduces glare very well . 
i put this on my wishlist and received it for christmas . 
this item looks great on my iphone num_extend
love this case and the built in screen protector . 
it s great to use when baking veggies to get all sides crispy . 
purchased this one to go with the larger i already had . 
i have had my cobalt blue mixer for about num_num years now . 
it is also lightweight and cost efficient as a cpap battery . 
somewhat larger than i thought it would be . 
this design comes in many different sizes ,  and matching napkins . 
i recommend it to anyone who uses electric to cook with . 
there is also no etching from the dishwasher . 
i settled for a credit back on the differences between the two models . 
this is the original product ,  not a fake imitation . 
i usually soak it for a fewhours before i can get it clean . 
it sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome . 
it should be cheaper !  i plan to update the included weatherbug widget . 
if you re going to hang them that s not an issue . 
otherwise ,  it does exactly what it says it does . 
stay away from them and buy these instead !  . 
it goes from whisper soft to very loud . 
they are medium weight metal with a black coating . 
the case is made of smooth rubber which provides a firm grip . 
you have to wait for it to ship for like num_num weeks . 
oh well ,  not like i use my phone while im sleeping . 
a soft scrubbing pad and dishwashing detergent and the cups are clean . 
all lights were on but motor wasn t running . 
i like the feel and the dark shade it has to it . 
so we tried the cuisinart stainless steel pan . 
this is the only case i use for my phone . 
this corkscrew is well constructed and easy to use . 
microfiber tips are not so squishy that everything is sloppy . 
the feel and look of the item was good . 
we had to replace our old bissel which was num_num years old . 
they re simple plastic measuring spoons that measure stuff . 
much cheaper than what i would have paid at the verizon store . 
not a big deal . all in all ,  good buy . 
it probably depends on how you handle your phone . 
they needed one at this place and one here ,  one there . 
love these anodized pans ,  will definitely be buying more of them . 
it catches all the smell and oil from the fryer . 
i just rinse them with water and wipe with a paper towel . 
i can still use it but cannot keep it standing up right . 
love this case ,  i ve gotten so many comments on this one . 
we have had no problem on skype when she uses this headset . 
the stand is solidly constructed ,  quite stable ,  and protects the tabletop . 
i purchased for under $ so it was a very good bargain . 
i choose clear glass because i know what s in it . 
very solid and expensive looking with a great  amoled i think  display . 
the size of the bowl is good for making decent quantities at once . 
large capacity is used often in my kitchen . 
these are much better than some i have purchased for older phones . 
because it is not soft ,  iphone stays inside securely . 
pricing was very fair and the quality is adequate for my needs . 
i got the gold color ,  which matches my hair and skin color . 
love fiesta ,  and was so happy to find this in white . 
what can i say ,  it s a battery and it works . 
it ships with an num_num gb microsd card . 
farberware has become my favorite brand for cookware . 
i would buy more of these in the future . 
but now i use them for most of my chopping and cutting . 
i honestly dropped my iphone many times and the case never chipped . 
the clip is strong and it stays put . 
for the price i don t think you ll find a better case . 
they are very easy to get at and change . 
i don t think that was available six weeks ago . 
decent price for the convenience of purchasing online . 
if you push the top down it just raises back up . 
 i remember the commercials from num_num years ago  . 
thanks for an easy transaction and a good product . 
rolling dough and working it on a marble board makes it much easier . 
if any thing changes i will update this . 
i will honestly say its worth every penny . 
the ipod however does not charge with the adapter on it . 
these do pretty much exactly what i need them to do . 
this phone provides a sturdy rubber case and is smart looking too . 
i buy about % organic or more whenever i can . 
for small spaces and small families ,  this is a great option . 
this truly might be the best product i ever brought in my lifetime . 
once i got pass that ,  the charger worked great . 
simply an ingenious design that has yet to be improved upon . 
i recommend this product and would purchase it again . 
these were advertised as oem panasonic belts but came in generic pouch . 
i got one of these from an overstock website a few weeks ago . 
it s tiny but much better than a sack laying on the ground . 
a good knife should never be serrated so it can be sharped . 
i actually use it for baking chicken and fish and not cookies . 
quick to charge when you really need them up and useful . 
you will also see how much memory the programs are using . 
i highly recommend this seller for their speedy and excellent product . 
the price went up $ i wish i bought more before . 
lightweight ,  but still feel substantial ,  because they are hollow . 
she seemed to besusceptible to various things in the air . 
this thing is powerful and puts out pepper like a champ . 
it looks good and the dimple makes it easy to unplug . 
i don t see how the over all functioning can be improved upon . 
the antique white has two different table settings available . 
you didn t see where the highlight shifted at the last minute . 
all four of these positions are useful in reducing my pain . 
buy more for the same shipping charge ,  and share with friends . 
in this case ,  tea is made well ,  and guests are impressed . 
she has used this product multiple times and loves the divider . 
my friend had purchased one for me over num_num month ago . 
hopefully it will last some time since we use it every day . 
i just don t care for the way it feels . 
shipping was reasonable considering i ordered it at the peak of christmas shipping . 
it was a great product for a wonderful price . 
i do think the texture is better too . 
i really want to say  duh  to that . 
so for a single person talking in the car ,  this is ideal . 
it s a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust . 
this is a tip i learned from nick malgieri . 
holds up well so far in the dishwasher . 
these are great for serving butter with meals . 
we registered for a set of these over on crate and barrel . 
it does exactly what i need it to do . 
getting the corkscrew to go in is no problem . 
calls using the puretalk network are clear and easy to hear . 
it works great ,  gets a lot of stuff out . 
it will more than half way charge my ipad num_extend
hopefully the paint won t peel like my incase did  iphone  awhile back . 
only problem is if the pasta is too thin it will tear . 
the double fans are excellent because they really do move the air . 
i really would not want to be without this shelfs now . 
everyone has a scale in their home ,  usually kept in the bathroom . 
i don t bother with the blue tea bag holder thing . 
i have put these in dishwaser by accident and seemed okay . 
for the money it s a great essential kitchen tool . 
lots of reviews already ,  so let me get to the num_extend
this pan should work great in our large big green egg . 
bought this for my granddaughter for her iphone she got for christmas . 
this is as good as it gets with coffee . 
easy to use ,  takes the lid right off . 
here is the good and the bad as i see num_extend
i despise a baking sheet with rounded corners . 
that s about all i can really say ,  lol . 
a gift someone usually does not buy for themselves . 
so ,  it had num_num ways it could have broken . 
green is for veggies ,  yellow for poultry ,  etc . 
i simply love how i can now truly soak . 
my first use was on some inexpensive pork chops . 
the lid will last a very long time that way . 
i ended up using it for a lot more . 
boils water plenty fast ,  i have no complaints . 
i plan to take it with me everywhere i go . 
this would be a great gift for your ipod or iphone enthusiast . 
this is the measuring cup that any kitchen needs . 
i love the vibrant red color of this case . 
i have used everything in the set except for the scissors . 
also they act as a display of clock when charging . 
the case on the picture looks the same on my case . 
bought this coffee maker to replace a mr . 
looks like i will be replacing my other num_num going forward . 
i m using the $ unltd plan with $ international . 
or for about num_num bucks you can buy hard copy . 
it actually works as advertised ,  easy and accurate . 
seems well constructed and has an attractive appearance . 
nice looking ,  very sturdy and great for serving . 
it came with some extra little goodies and that a surprise . 
i bought this for my wife and she loves it . 
it is horribly bulky ,  but it got the job done . 
i ordered another set to keep on hand . 
do not be tempted to use your hands to save time . 
i only use it to mash certain food items when i cook . 
i purchased this item for my  cool daddy  fryer . 
i got all these great ideas from this book . 
i love this thing it charges my evo where others have failed . 
would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheapo car charger . 
it fits perfectly and looks good on the phone . 
i bought num_num of them and two of the containers were broken . 
a good steel is vital for keeping knives sharp . 
all opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone . 
and the disks slip in and out easily . 
i was used to renting the rug doctor from a supermarket . 
funny how people can get so attached to a knife . 
have used this multiple times when out and about ,  traveling ,  etc . 
using the highest setting this went super quick . 
it looks as clean as the first day . 
i can t say enough good things about these jersey sheets . 
i just ordered these and they came in the other day . 
i d definitely buy another kitchen stainless steel product of theirs . 
the volume is a slider on the headset . 
may not be the best quality but havent had any problems . 
i wouldn t say it s anything that bothers you though . 
tilia ,  the company behind villaware ,  also sells foodsaver . 
i got these to have nice ,  straight sides on layer cakes . 
if i experience any problems i ll update this review . 
it is a very versatile kitchen tool and looks great too !  . 
the price is under six dollars which is just okay . 
i actually had trouble finding a decent sized doughnut cutter locally . 
for the price ,  this is a very good deal . 
 u need the foodsaver sealer along with it to use it . 
but ,  this little machine is not only cute . 
often used with mio or similar ,  and always tastes great . 
the point of a screen protector is protection . 
well ,  gambling four bucks was no problem ,  and it paid off . 
the headset sits around your neck resting on your shoulders . 
the wireless headset was suggested by a blended son on thanksgiving day . 
just be aware of the usual little static and grinder to receiver problems . 
i even got a second one i use for cooking now . 
that third taste seemed identical to the previous taste . 
i was so happy with ease of use . 
it s a lot smaller than the picture might imply . 
unique sizes and shapes ,  quality bamboo  no splintering  ,  modest price . 
its not a universal storage for all knives . 
i bought this mixer for my wife and she absolutely loves it . 
this moka pot does the iced drinks perfectly . 
however ,  the reception varies from area to area . 
you can pull it out of the closet anytime and do spot cleaning . 
not all sheets regardless of who makes them are the same . 
it works very well with my iphone and now my iphone is safe . 
bowl to speed up the baking assembling process . 
thats a lot for a case this small . 
i m not often impressed with everything i get ,  but this device . 
it works great  !  very good product !  easy to clean . 
like the caster wheels ,  for easy movement around the num_extend
you receive what you paid for ,  good value . 
cons :  only num_num case for credit cards and it is partially exposed . 
america s test kitchen gave it very good rating . 
i imagine in time it will lose some of its initial sharpness . 
but it had a plastic film covering it . 
it walked off the counter and fell on the floor . 
i just received this item promptly yesterday and began using it this morning . 
ditto for while it was in my purse . 
but these are only minor gripes ,  and overall i m extremely pleased . 
small price to pay for a great ,  inexpensive coffeemaker and travel mug . 
it s also pretty easy to clean and fascinating to watch !  . 
it appears to be slightly more sturdy than previous ones i had purchased . 
it cooks just like the big one ,  really fast and grease free . 
so far no issues or disconnections with it . 
i love the quality ,  edge ,  and feel of this knife . 
try one hand only if you re trying to show off . 
have been frying chicken in my shallow cast iron pan for years . 
much better than the ones that came with the bb . 
as another reviewer stated ,  the title can be very deceiving . 
all but one was inferior either in performance or operational convenience . 
i ve had this case since the first week of november num_extend
the feel is heavy and has held up great inside and outside . 
however ,  i will have to say the difference is subtle . 
i have two gusto bowls ,  in peacock and shamrock . 
haven t had a chance to use it yet on the road . 
makes great cheesecakes !  cleans easily and is a great value . 
can find plenty of the small ones here but not the large . 
if you do; then this is the best one going . 
for me ,  it was much harder to master an espresso machine . 
slight echo of myself when using it on the num_extend
some users suggest tamping the espresso while others suggest to not do it . 
i bought this after i lost my original apple ipad charger . 
the ear bud fits kind of snug in my ear . 
we love tea ,  but hated the tea kettle on the burner issue . 
i really like this and didn t know that they were available . 
i would highly reccommend this to anyone that has a kitchen . 
i recommend this to anyone who desires quality china pieces with butterflies . 
it is easy to use and does an excellent job . 
it makes a wonderful num_num grain healthy bead . 
it s stainless steel and very sturdy ,  same great kitchenaid quality . 
i m an avid amateur cook ,  and love entertaining . 
my phone is full of electricity ,  i ll tell you that . 
santoku knives are currently very trendy in the foodie world . 
you cannot deglaze after searing something ,  since wine is usually acidic . 
comfortable handle that seems pretty solid ,  and it s a good size . 
the one thing i do not like is how easily the top scratches . 
the dual mics definitely decrease the amount of background noise . 
somebody said they dropped theirs from num_num feet and it didn t break . 
this is very comfortable and you tend to forget you are wearing it . 
i owned one of these and lost it . 
this one is probably my fav right not . 
shipping was a little slow ,  but the package arrived without damage . 
i bought this for my wife because her iphone num_extend is constantly dead . 
this apron fits well and has a nice adjustable strap . 
in fact ,  i am grateful for the smaller size . 
i wound up giving it away to a friend . 
i wanted a rack big enough to handle my giant cookies . 
comes in a variety of sizes and napkins too . 
i think it works really well for measuring . 
a quick ,  efficient way to brew your coffee in the morning . 
after seeing it in person my husband wants one as well . 
i am giving these num_num stars for the headphone design and sound . 
i haven t used it long enough to comment on num_extend
i used this every morning to grind coffee beans . 
my mother had one just like this so i bought my own . 
haven t tested myself ,  but he says it produces tasty coffee . 
they are not fussy ,  but make eating steak and pork a pleasure . 
it is really very well made as well as being a excellent value . 
i have used these wonderful square boards for years . 
works for dta transfer pdanet ,  an probably for whatever you need . 
i used this case for num_num months before switching to the iphone num_extend
i protects mt device without taking away from its form . 
it ,  being all glass ,  looks fantastic with fresh juice in it . 
i ve been using it for all sorts of cooking . 
if you need the filter ,  not so much . 
i posted the pictures on this page under customer pictures . 
my wife used these for a cupcake shopped she started num_num years ago . 
these phones work very well and are more durable than the add stated . 
this product was a great price and works well with my ipad . 
nice hard case that fits iphone num_num perfectly . 
the fit every bottle i ve had and i use them constantly . 
a num_num month would make a lot more sense . 
these nylon mixing spoons are the only ones i use anymore . 
the controls ,  multiple functions ,  cord holder ,  attachments ,  etc . 
and a little disappointed on how my burgers stuck to the pan . 
  .  .  .   . the razor is simple phone ,  a good phone . 
i am tired of buying vacuums that break . 
i plan to use this for grinding seeds ,  nuts ,  and grains . 
i use this little gadget while riding motorcycle . 
the blade is made by solingen ,  a german knife making firm . 
no hunting for cords ,  just place it on the mat . 
need to replace a battery maybe every num_num months . 
i will update review if i notice anything different with extended use . 
this color combination looks nothing like what is shown in the images . 
but it is pretty easy to do . it really cleans well . 
it used to be covered with dust ,  which i am allergic to . 
pay attention to the current draw on your device . 
i a so glad someone told me to look here . 
this is one of my kitchen gadgets i cannot be without . 
after a week of reading reviews i decided to go with the krups . 
i m so happy to have found this item . 
this is well constructed and works better than the last three i had . 
it came in a timely fashion and well packaged . 
the offset design keeps your knuckles out of the way while slicing . 
they are long enough i don t have to get my hands  involved  . 
perfect for pounding chicken breasts and other meats . 
which seems pretty cool ,  if you need that service . 
bought this to go with my new cutting board . 
a great mixer for all your baking needs . 
i took the clip from my other bluetooth to keep it in place . 
the phone feels so easy fitting in one hand . 
the call quality of this earpiece is amazing . 
i ve seen no fading that i can tell . 
it was really easy to install as well . 
they are sturdy and high quality ,  with leveling feet . 
it also makes it feel less humid in my central florida bathroom . 
this is the third time i have purchased this waffle iron . 
it developed a leak at the base of the water level indicator . 
it has the cuisinart quality and a good price on amazon . 
doing coffee that way was just too much work anyway . 
it was really easy to use and did a great job !  . 
however ,  i consider this a feature ,  not a bug . 
it is easy to use and works works perfectly . 
also has a check light for reminding to check your filter . 
i bought from a num_extend party retail off amazon . 
this is the second one of these i bought . 
the manual humorously mentions that  your first espresso is probably not very good  . 
i am sure i shall find out soon . 
bought this for my car charger since the one i had stopped working . 
an amazing addition to our set !  fits perfectly into the block . 
you can peel anything that needs peeling ,  of course . 
makes perfect little loaves ,  ideally suited for singles or couples . 
i had to order the smaller size to fit on the shelf . 
lines are smooth and more thin than other stylus pens . 
in the lving room which is around num_num square feet . 
i ll go back to the app store to find replacements i like . 
it s not a big deal . the quality is excellent . 
can t beat the price for the quality and storage capacity . 
i may just order the latest version at that time . 
i took a chance and ordered this bowl . 
will last forever ,  no more cheap spatula s for me . 
i was so impressed with the num_extend that i bought a num_extend santuko . 
she loves wilton products and has a lot of them . 
so ,  not much of a leap to a lodge pro pizza pan . 
i don t go through many but they work . 
very easy to use; tablet  clicks  into place easily . 
both of these products combined really make for an almost indestructible phone !  . 
moving air in the apt makes a huge difference . 
you can stick them in the dishwasher no problem unlike some others . 
once with marinade and once with dry seasoning . 
cooking veggies makes them easier to eat but will destroy important nutrients . 
this holster is the best that i have found yet . 
i was very pleased with this little chopper . 
looks very nice and is a great little basket for odds and ends . 
the headset is compatible via usb with both pc s and mac . 
in one pass the floor is completely bone dry and streak free . 
this kitchen tool i use almost every day . 
but ,  it s really it isn t that big of a deal . 
oh how i missed the smooth bold flavor of percolated coffee . 
when i removed the old filter it was dirty and brown . 
good to be able to charge the battery outside the phone . 
the cover is plastic and regular popsicle sticks go in the holes easily . 
my only complaint is it doesnt have a screw lid . 
i had no problem when i ordered myself some . 
you don t have to press very hard or anything . 
i have used mine to make molded jello ,  cakes ,  breads . 
easy access to the rest of the buttons . 
but for what they are you cannot find a more efficient system . 
so i decided to get one for each car . 
don t forget to buy the screen shields also . 
 i only tested it once .   so it is a good inexpensive backup . 
s s s s s s s s s s s . 
they cut even the thickest steaks well and without much effort . 
the instructions are complete and easy to follow . 
i bought this in conjunction with the fruit and vegetable strainer . 
she does like this one and she hears very well out of it . 
this is the second one i purchase from amazon . 
it also comes with a bonus adapter clip for a camera tripod . 
i got this and was able to put it together within num_num hours . 
plenty of spoon room and lids stand up neet and proud . 
and this is why most of my online purchases are with amazon . 
i got this phone for my brother and he absolutely loves it . 
i did by an otter box for it . 
i have had no sticking or breakage like others . 
kensington is a good brand for mobile accessories . 
just wipe it down with a wet paper towel . 
it was great !  i can t wait to try seafood . 
hopefully lasts a long time .  .  . so far so good . 
i ll be cooking a prime rib in just a couple of days . 
the elago slim fit case was a perfect match . 
it s the little things that make me happy . 
this will give you a much sturdier pan hangar . 
must have for any motorola phone with hdmi . 
now i am installing them in the other two bathrooms as well . 
for my purposes ,  that was a big mistake . 
i bought this for that purpose and it solved the issue . 
i have an older version of the same pan . 
just wish there was a longer cord to it . 
they really did make a case that protected the phone real well . 
the cake released like a dream ,  and the cleanup was effortless . 
i ordered this in early december and it arrived yesterday . 
ordered it on monday ,  and received it on tuesday . 
as usual oxo has a good ,  high quality kitchen tool here . 
not from the grill ,  but from the food and drippings . 
instead ,  it s the best buy on the market today . 
bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick . 
place it the jug ,  which is then placed in the preheated container . 
i have been looking for something like this for a while . 
and this is an easy way to get started . 
never had chicken or beef that was better than this item produces . 
easy to bend and dump things into the pot . 
the design is compact running about num_extend x num_extend x num_extend high . 
this charger is better than most of the cheap knock offs . 
i like this product because it really protects my phone . 
the online banking application does everything for you . 
i should have had one of these years ago !  . 
been looking for this like my mom had forever at a good price . 
i didnt buy this from amazon ,  it came packaged with my num_extend
they are easy to install and soft to the touch . 
you can t switch tips without changing the bag . 
clearly did not want a battery powered piece . 
knowing what i know now ,  this is a pretty decent case . 
it came quickly ,  and the price seemed reasonable to me . 
i tested this belkin professional stylus with my kindle fire . 
that comes in handy in airports or other noisy environments . 
i love the reusable filter for so many reasons . 
that way ,  you get the best of both worlds . 
this has a beater bar function for light duty vacuuming of carpet . 
i will never go back to the george forman grill . 
so far the battery is holding charge long enough . 
after a few other purchases  and returns  we are happy with this model . 
follow this and it won t rust . made in the usa . 
fits my htc rezound perfectly and protects from scratches . 
this item came in a generic cardboard box ,  which was nice . 
it works fine ,  of course ,  as it is not moved . 
we had the old version of this spinner and it finally broke . 
you should not expect oem retail packaging though . 
great in coffee ,  hot chocolate ,  hot oatmeal ,  everything . 
i listened to a youtube videos of it . 
this is not solid maple but a mixture of different hardwoods . 
really easy to clean and easy to use !  . 
it does its job and im happy to use it . 
i use this meat grinder on beef ,  pork and veal . 
this is the skillet to have on a number of fronts . 
was looking for this type of case for a long time . 
over time ,  these arms have cracked off at their bases . 
this was an easy and practical way to fondant it up !  . 
i replaced a copy cat ikea chopper with this official oxo one . 
i use this small slow cooker to make jellies and sauces . 
this is a rather thick rubbery cover for your nokia num_extend
good for my ipod and ipad . will use when traveling . 
it looks bulky and heavy ,  but the unit is very light . 
the divider accomplishes its purpose of keeping two foods separate . 
it s been charging my phone for the last num_num days . 
you can really feel the quality when you hold it . 
i bought this case to protect my motorola droid x . 
as for the new cover ,  i really like the fit and feel . 
easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  makes great ice cream . 
excellent for cookie dough as well as chilled pastry and raw num_extend
this is the first time this system flopped for me . 
i plan to buy more for other dry goods . 
no more annoying notices for every email you get . 
we re on our second one of these in the last num_num years . 
this was exactly what i ve been looking for . 
in my opinion ,  it beats steaming the milk . 
i think its a nice gift for a stand mixer owner . 
i ordered this item and absolutely love it . 
its very easy to put on and its not bulky . 
decent product for the price ,  and i would recommend . 
the charging port states that it can flow as much as num_extend amp . 
also keeps hands clean pulling dough to the sides . 
put it in the garage for a couple of days after receiving it . 
this knife is true to wusthof quality ,  design and style . 
the three together on a tray look very nice out on the counter . 
if something happens to this ,  i will get another . 
i like that and will probably choose more at a later date . 
i have been using the num_extend for the past year . 
i do not find this to be the case . 
i use this to listen to podcasts and videos when waiting around . 
it finally started charging intermittently so it needed replaced . 
i bought the food saver for my daughter about a year ago . 
i am a very happy customer and recomend this item without hesitation . 
i ve got many pieces and i love them all . 
realy recommended if you want to remplace your original tool . 
it doubles as a carving knife because of it s size . 
overall ,  a good product at a very good price . 
i haven t found a better solution yet ,  though . 
this is not a pan or a microwave or something like that . 
easy to fill ,  longlasting num_extend hour reservior  and dependable . 
i was expecting a light weight plastic caddy . 
a few minor mods and it works for me . 
i bought this at least num_num years ago ,  i think . 
i have used it for almost a year with no problems . 
this hanging sweater dryer is great; just what i needed . 
i have used both stock and aftermarket chargers . 
portable and keeps water cold all day when filled with ice . 
they were so easy to work with and looked so beautiful . 
it still works as well as it did num_num years ago . 
i actually use this right now in my bathroom . 
the material is a little cheap but other than that i love it . 
i have bought so many honey dispensers and they were all a disappointment . 
all in all ,  a great fan for the price . 
not oem quality even though it mimics oem in appearance . 
for a great sleep i highly recommend these sheets . 
note that to get effective chopping ,  you shouldn t overload it . 
function : great for scrubbing pots ,  plates ,  pans ,  and bowls . 
she is going to love hers as much as i love mine . 
i bought this for my daughter s shoes and it s great . 
i make tortillas very often and this press makes it so much easier . 
lightly oil them and put anything you re drying on them . 
i frequently recommend this to friends and family . 
i def would purchase this again ,  if i get another cracked screen . 
the price was reasonable and sure looks oem to me . 
it stays on the kitchen counter for easy access . 
i needed a stovetop griddle and lodge is what i looked for first . 
this caused the enamel to flake off and seriously discolored the kettle . 
good for a starter for ur teenagers or yourself . 
this headset is light ,  compact ,  and easy to use . 
this car mount is the best i ve ever used .
