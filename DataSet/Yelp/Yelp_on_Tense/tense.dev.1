the food here is utterly horrible .
it is disgusting .
waiting room is very small .

_num_ gets two stars from me .
food , nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant .

this place is just eh in my book .
there are so many different places in scottsdale that are better .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .

everything is greasy and not very fresh .
this store though has some horrible associates .
your store employees are pathetic .
the man that works here is horrible .
ok , i get it .
unfortunately , the service is far from perfection .
why it takes the orange table _num_ minutes is beyond me .
most of them are bland .

the food is terrible .
slimy mayo covers the lettuce and tomato .
food is terrible !

it 's like ordering fish at a burger place !
your beer special is a $ _num_ miller lite ?
it 's american food in the worst sense big island meat loaf ?
oh just die already .
this goes for my boyfriend as well .
so , maybe that makes us individually spoiled in some way ?
the miso soup seems like its from a dry mix .
too expensive for what you get .
here is where stuff gets bad .
_num_ minutes later , we get our food .
there is very little fish on the rolls compared to other sushi places .
blew me away that is a $ _num_ roll ?
sorry it 's a bit late .
there is a problem .
this restaurant has a problem .
one star is too high .
is she stupid !
most of the girls that work at this location have the worst customer service .
usually never have a bad experience here , usually really nice girls .

it 's the male bartender that really brought the rating down .
hey , mistakes happen .
i have no clue .
okay , so normally i like courtyard hotels a lot !
the bathroom area is nothing special .
there 's no indoor seating .
every shot they pull is old by the time they use it .
i got a vanilla latte a couple minutes ago : it 's bitter .
generally the afternoons have the most inexperienced and poorly trained staff .
the main barista ( afternoons ) generally lacks in quality control .
this place have such a bad customer service .
this property is desperately in need of an update .
the room smells bad .
however , my bed is awful .
okay , perhaps _num_ is a slight ( gross ? )
this is the exception .
totally bland .
their food is of poor quality and high cost .
this place is a joke , the food is bland .
the cons : the rest of the food is pretty mediocre .
the tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing .
i think pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff .
_num_ stars overall .
it 's that bad .
complete rip off , dont believe the hype .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
there are many great mexican places in scottsdale , so skip this one .
this place is only for cocktails on the patio for the nice local .
they deserve _num_ !
however , that 's about where it ends from our experience .
it 's plain condescending .
that 's `` sir '' , or the name on my gold card .
so this is _num_ star reviewed for the second time in a row .
which is unfortunate , because they usually have a good product .
the tortillas they brag about were cold and tasteless .
this place is horrible - go somewhere else .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
also , walk around the property .
mahi mahi tacos smelly and not fresh .
it was good mexican but not for the prices they charge .
the margaritas taste like a whole lot of water and no alcohol .
they are the low fat kind you buy from the grocery store .

hopefully the next item i go everything runs smoothly .
this is sin for mexican .
super disappointed with this place as it has potential .
dirty looks from at least _num_ people .

it seems like you see the same people there all the time .
seriously peeps ... a country boy like me ... .
the bread is tasteless and light , sort of like styrofoam .
as with the meat , they put only a small cut on each sandwich .
everyone burns a pizza ... it happens .
cheese and butter make an awful combo .
if you use quality mozzarella its not like that .
however , i am a food snob .
this is the area grazie seriously lacks .
here is the problem .
i understand the cheap labor that is available in arizona but , come on .
_num_ minutes later , still no table .
i called the restaurant back , requesting that we add one more .
worst part is that they charge $ _num_ for the damn thing !
a hint that they use cheap cheese .
this place get negative stars !
_num_ minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on .
_num_ hours for pizza and dessert is nuts !
one thing i noticed is also how bad the pizza looked !
food is mediocre .
very painful when you have a starving _num_ year old .
sorry just think this is weird and unprofessional .
the problem is the kitchen .
i 'm still so confused about this place .
the downstairs units are horrid for one major reason .
i mean every step .
- the nurses argue .
this place is an absolute joke !
and i never come to the er for pain i just deal with it .
because the longer you stay in the room the higher your bill .
save your money call your primary at least they care .
they let him sit there for _num_ hours .
they 're rude , terrible service , terrible attitudes .
coming back with the drinks , the server ( allison , i think ? )
there are other flavors besides butter and garlic .
parking is a headache with a five floor gated parking garage .
the motto here is hate where you live .
loud garage if you live next to it .
this is completely unacceptable .
there are better places , it 's expensive for such poor quality of staff .
rude office ladies all the time .
moving out of this place is hell .
the parking garage is a whole other disaster in itself .
this location is so slow .
i guess it 's the man in charge on the evening i went .
`` you 're better than that . ''
this place is such a pile of shit .
holy crap are they slow .
the only good thing about this place is the extremely cheap beer .
is there a negative number for review ?
it is a horrible place .
yes , it 's cheap .
this is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business .
the waitress never starts before about _num_ pm .
it sucks for the patron .
i guess it just make their life easier for scheduling .
i personally hate this place !
it stinks .
i find that ridiculous !
really , is that allowed ?
you know , the ones over $ _num_ .
it looks old and outdated .
it 's dirty and filthy .
this bugs me more than anything else , even the damage to the vehicles .

the manager gave me the bullshit that they are service dogs .
bad customer service and trucks that are in poor working condition .
this is over _num_ hours !
laundry room is horrible .
me : i know , except that this ride is for tomorrow morning .
no wonder the employees are rude .
course is in terrible conditions .
the poor conditions keep serious players away .
which makes me sad .
also the gym is huge but none of the equipment works !
this ends today sadly .
there is no security whatsoever .
who does this , no other apartment complex 's do .
the grass is dead everywhere .
the view from my front door is literally a pile of garbage .
so what if it 's ugly for a few months ? ''
this place is so ugly and disgusting !
this apartment complex has the absolute worst parking situation ever .
it is a compete and total disregard to the tenants here .
they barely have enough spaces for the people who live there .
the walls are that thin .
just not when it actually matters for their residents .
this place is crap !
jesus ; this place has zero concept of time .
the other main problem is that most of the people here are older .
lets just say i wish i went to the many other resorts in scottsdale .
oh yeah , the hotel is old , tired and run down .
this review is strictly for relish burger bistro located at resort by golf club .
anything they say , ask in writing .
it 's terrible .
terrible service is restaurants .
first off , they no longer include mimosas .
this place is absolutely horrible .
i first step in the store it reeks of monkey balls lol .
this business has worst return policies !
the restaurant seating is ok.
me : what is expensive ?
this place is terrible .
the woman who runs the shop is rude .
the staff is helpful and friendly .
there 's another issue : pricing .
this place is disappointing and everybody who works there is useless .
which makes me feel uncomfortable .
sounds to me like she just wants my money .
i guess they thought i was stupid or something .
the pics you see here are nothing like the place .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
major fail !
so i walk away with two lessons learned .
_num_ minutes later i go inside and ask for a refund .
scottsdale ( indian school ) kfc is horrible .
employees are rude and very slow .
the foods here are pretty bland .
every other stalls sell plain tacos .
the non tacos vendors are drinks and chain restaurants .
its not worth what you pay .
for those two things alone , i give _num_ stars .
i really miss this festival !
the staff is ok , not extremely nice but not mean .
fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me !
an _num_ hour grooming appointment is ridiculous and unacceptable .
i 'm sorry to my red bone .
this kind of veterinary care is unacceptable and careless by my standards .
poor thing , i 'm so glad i took her home though .
i am a plumber , asshole .
s e v e n t y dollars .
so anyway , buy nothing but the very minimum of what you need there .
i just wish they were a little less expensive .
this place has a chaotic feel .
they serve potato chips with all their sandwiches , no fries .
it 's so expensive for an unappetizing sundae .
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
this place just sucks .
they charge for refills too !
there are only a few flavors of ice cream .
_num_ minutes go by without any service .
so now after _num_ minutes i also ask for water , napkins and silverware .
old , dirty and it looks smelly .
this place is just awful now .
are we in los angeles at these prices ?
there is a really bad smell as soon as you walk inside the door .
it 's such a shame .
over inflated prices for food that is beyond sub par .
dr. wilson is just unethical .
this places deserves negative stars !
i have had no problems with the friendliness of the staff .
if , like me , your time is precious , stay clear !
this place is awful !
unfortunately , management needs an attitude adjustment .
never buy lv !
the oriental girl that works here is super rude .
although i think the false advertising is crap .
when you walk in , it smells like feet .
the teachers are awful also .
`` you grab their little legs and pull . ''
honestly , taco bell is a better choice .
kind of disappointed in you , los olivos .
it 's sad .
the plates are gross looking .
this is a low rent dive type mexican place .
the food is just plain bad .
this place is just a tourist trap in old town scottsdale .
everything else is pretty mediocre and flavorless .
this place lacks so much .
however , i think the food is pretty bland .
i also think it 's a bit overpriced .
also , the food is overpriced .
the patio is awful !
the food is basic canned beans and standard rice and overpriced .
either way , you 're better off at chipotle .
the staff is so rude !
the service is very bad .
the food is better than most mediocre mexican restaurants but not worth the hassle .
if you go here , go luck .
this is by far the worst mexican place ever .
the others i ate with had food that was pretty mediocre .
they 're bad !
so , that 's it for los olivos .
$ _num_ , if you want strawberry . )
their is nothing authentic about the `` mexican '' food they offer .
taco bell is also better than this restaurant .
los olivos is a long time scottsdale restaurant .
we get home , the burgers are burnt - not edible .
this is the worst burger king in the valley !
first of all they are sooo slow !
that is the only good thing about this starbucks .
this starbucks is terrible .
also , it always seems like their coffee is hella burnt .
there is something on the bottle list for everyone .
i 'm still kind of confused about how i feel about this place .
prices are ridiculous - $ _num_ per glass of unknown cabernet .
not worth a $ _num_ cover , folks .
once again , no kidding , folks .
ps : clientele is as pretentious as they say .
spend your money somewhere where they actually care about their customers .
now i know i hate this place .
however , the staff is rude and unorganized .
the _num_ stars comes form the insanely loud live jazz music .
the wait staff knows nothing about wine .
this is ridiculous !
the food is only average as is the wine .
i believe their service is the worst .
it 's a wednesday night at 9pm and there are only _num_ people here .
cons : cover charge is ridiculous .
this is a wine bar , no excuses .
the place is dead as fuck .
the owner and manager are absolutely obnoxious .
there 's only a couple employees and like one maid ?
there is no tv in the bedroom either .
worst hotel in scottsdale , it certainly seems so .
this place is overpriced , poor menu design and flat out unimpressive .
if you 're cowboy ciao , the answer to all of these is no .
that 's all i really know from my end of the table .
service is very very slow .
$ _num_ later .
free mimosa just ok mimosa .
ambiance is very mediocre and nothing special .
there are hardly any vegetarian options and no vegan options .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
unfortunately , this place is a little pretentious for my liking .
i love nordstrom , let me start off my saying that .
most places typically charge $ _num_ with a one week turnaround .
the people who work there are so so so so so rude .
way too pricy for what you actually get , for sure .
this place is just ... ick .
the food is ok but the service just sucked .
this is the most pathetic excuse for dining there is .
the food is awful .
this is the worst food ever .
white trash people you now have another gathering spot besides the greyhound bus terminals .
everything on my plate , a regular slam , is cold .

the kid is definitely odd and a bit rude , i.e .
this is nothing but a greedy money making scam .
who closes for maintenance ?
they make their pancakes with peanut oil .
which makes me sad , because i 'm allergic to peanuts .
after about _num_ minutes , my pancake arrives .
place needs a deep cleaning and training in customer service .
there is an atm that charges a $ _num_ fee , yay .
for what they charge , yes portions are a bit on the small side .
the manager is a dishonest dealer .
the no credit cards accepted is a bit ridiculous in this day .
rather they charge you double for this luxury .
i never had a place burn my eggs before .
the food here is mediocre at best .
it 's very small inside , the atmosphere is rather boring and bland .
just for the rudeness they get a _num_ star forever .
oh one more thing this place hates cell phones .
i like diners and this feels like an old time diner .
the food is super bland , over priced and over-cooked .
food is mediocre .
it 's creepy .
so i throw a ball down the lane .
now there are _num_ balls stuck in the pit on lanes _num_ & _num_ .
this place has terrible customer service and lousy employees that work there .
this is unacceptable prices for a bowling alley .
um , hello , how is that fair ?
i feel bad for his employees .
the employees at this store have attitude .
this place is a waste of time .
the website is even worse .
this is just a poorly run company .
no wonder this place has all one star reviews .
it also has a very bad smell inside .
arizona school of real estate gives you _num_ different study guides .
then when the a/c goes on it gets so cold you need a jacket .
god help , i have no idea why .
i find that very odd .
the check-in process seems overly complicated .
the owner and staff is absolutely unprofessional and rude .
plus , it is expensive .
but when it comes to full priced dinners ... go elsewhere .
the macaroni and cheese is so-so .
i am still very unsatisfied with this company .
it is very rude and inappropriate .
it is _num_ mile south !
i have _num_ emails , _num_ call and we are all set .

this family is a disgrace to the art business .
pool area is not terrible , but not great either .
this is ridiculous nonsense !
sadly it never does !
that 's probably how the holes became so .
they have it worse off than you .
admittedly , i am in fact angry .
this place sucks .
i 'm beyond disappointed with this establishment .
so you know it was probably pretty bad !
this place sucks .
meat tastes like straight asshole !
it was ok need some seasoning for sure .
it 's better anyway !
this place sucks .
this place is creepy .
the crust is too buttery and not crispy or chewy .
this is a failed attempt at a ny slice .
they get _num_ stars because the pizza looked amazing .
just fyi to the employees , not everyone that comes here is drunk .
that 's why i have them _num_ stars .
the worst pizza ever eaten .
_num_ minutes later i get an angry knock at the door .
he just said its not on the receipt when it clearly states so .
after calling back the woman who has an accent had a rude tone .
vary bad customer service for delivery .
i have no idea what kind of crack people are smoking in phoenix .
i also worry about cleanliness .
we were meeting old friends that we meet on a cruise .
i guess in dc they have significantly better thai .
it is thai food in scottsdale .
however , usually , the pad thai is good .
overall , the food is too salty and too saucy .
the only thing thai about malee 's are the owners .
i 'm in the industry too , i know how it goes !
love phx but this is just another hyped up average girl next door .
the sauces are too thick , salty and not subtle .
they use the wrong white rice , short grain instead of jasmine .
however , the food is not quite thai food .
the best thai food is of course in los angeles thai town .
for the money , you 're better off going elsewhere .
nothing special not sure what the fuss is all about .
my go-to thai order is panang curry .
also be advised that malee 's charges scottsdale prices .
really bland .
this is unacceptable and disgusting behavior .
management appears brain dead .
that 's like a server counting a tip while standing at your table .
it is rundown and needs updates .
there are more reputable car washes close .
this place is just plain nasty .
the reviews are wrong . ''
this place sucks .
they are wrong .
it 's just so bad .
qt and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper .
you have 4-5 nurses in the office who do nothing .

`` why not complain to management '' you say ?
the place is horrible .
it 's ridiculous !
really the only good thing about this place is the location .
one star is honestly a stretch for this place .
is there an option for _num_ stars ?
she said that coach does give boxes or sells boxes .
in the `` upgraded '' apartment there is a washer and dryer in unit .
the units are outdated , dark , and depressing .
if you live here , you only get one assigned covered parking space .
mind you , there are only about _num_ `` free '' parking spaces .
once they get you in the door , they forget about you .
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
i urge everyone go to anywhere else !
it really makes the entire experience go downhill .
it 's pf changs .
it 's generic americanized asian food .
taste is average and not worth the cost .
pei wei is just as awful for less .
we ordered the carnitas tacos appetizer which is _num_ tacos .
this restaurant lets pet dogs inside .
it 's disgusting .
unfortunately i still hate it _num_ months later .
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
the lack of customer service is horrendous !
very disappointing and happens almost all the time .
buyer beware , its not what you think it is .
no wonder they have so many bad reviews here !
when you get past the quantity you realize that the food is pretty bland .
so here 's the deal on the service .
even for family style plates , i think it 's slightly overpriced .
when they say a small serves 2-3 , that 's 2-3 lunch sized portions .
if you 're a `` healthy '' eater , count on _num_ .
tasty but overpriced at $ _num_ for two breasts imo .
dinner portions are only for _num_ or _num_ people .
there is no single serving size for dinner !
this place is gross .
this place is awful , the food is also awful .
food is expensive for the lack of quality .
i mean , we finished the calamari and no sign of the wine .
no i mean very bland .
that 's completely unacceptable .
they also walk you through the kitchen on the way to your table .
when i first walked in it has a weird setup .
( _num_ ) dish out of a party of _num_ .
there are dozens of better places in old town and scottsdale in general .
dr. marks and his staff are extremely rude !
this place is horrible .
the manager is rude .
the staff is horrible .
there are so many better options just a stones throw away .
seriously , i want it hot .
_num_ ) apology in words means very little .
my insurance fully covers all routine visits ( cleaning , basic x-rays ) .
this is a bitter review .
lastly , my nails look horrible !
did no massage , says it 's only for deluxe pedicure .
the gel polish is uneven and overall the pedicure looks sloppy .
okay atmosphere , it smells really bad inside .
i call bs , and poor business practices .
the card clearly said free gel pedicure , which is a $ _num_ value .
his only response was `` i 'm sorry . ''
i have the most awful upstairs neighbors .
the last thing that kills me about this place is how overpriced it is .
the staff are horrible .
their customer service skills are worse than mcdonalds employees .
anything she tells you is a lie .
there are enough cockroaches for a horror film .
here it 's like hell .
some of the residents are questionable .
only thing good is the location .
the management has no authority .
the crust is not new york style , it 's just regular hand tossed .
this place sucks .
no taste no flavor a basic chain style pie with no soul .
pizza is a little below average , i think .
this is the new normal under scottsdale healthcare .
oh and the drinks are expensive too .
yes , i 'm dumb on how i spend my money .
drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much .
this place is so not worth it , go somewhere else .
the food here is pretty blah .
so the bf and i sit there .
the other table gets their beers and sushi ... still nothing !
i mean $ _num_ dollars for pretty okay egg rolls ?
the pho is super bland !
there are way better places around for thai or asian food .
it tastes horrible , stay away .
maybe , but this ran me nearly _num_ $ .
too bad because it 's so close to where we live .
the plate is full with unnecessary crispy noodle .
i hate the hub .
it is just obnoxious .
it so `` i hate my life !
however , the online part of staples is great !
no easy button for you ... staples !
it seems every time i come to this location i have a negative experience .
this new and improved dunkin donuts is the worst .
keep in mind i only want the one kind of donut .
i go get them elsewhere both times after disappointed .
no hand washing or food service gloves .
no hand washing or food service gloves .
this place is horrible !
no spice , no flavor , and runny as all get out .
the bartender , i think his name was louie , was very friendly .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
i have no idea how this place has _num_ stars on here .
the service is atrocious .
it 's just insane .
this place is ridiculous .
it 's dreadful and just pathetic .
zero stars .
strangely enough the salsa are too bland .
i know , i know .
not long after our food comes .
i 'm always disappointed .
they have terrible customer service , especially at the corporate level !
such a shame that reputable company like this does that .
the coke tasted like they have moldy lines or something .
without the caesar dressing it 's just a salad .
the service here is awful !
man , sucks for you .
i guess your loss is someone else 's gain .
this place is awful !
the customer service here is awful !
that 's no big deal .
the issue just begins here though .
they also make homemade fries and onion rings which was a plus .
he is very rude .
you get four tacos , seasoned beef or chicken .
it 's here where things were just a little bit off .
there are simply better options around the city .
this is a _num_ star rating .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
a shame too because it 's so close to the house .
my other half had the bbq ribs w/ coleslaw and mashed potatoes .
it is a typical upscale american restaurant .
i 'm sorry - look around .
throughout the course of our meal , i think four servers served us .
it is the new asu head coach , you know . ''
it needs a major overhaul , then there is the parking lot .
the prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter .
that is horrific customer service !
calling my review a rant is not good customer service .
only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food .
too bad the ribs are what you come for .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
the room is loud and crowded .
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
they charge for everything , fries , toppings , everything is extra .
we are extremely disappointed .
no vegetarian choices , so-so side dishes .
i hate this place .
in my opinion , that ruins a small intimate show .
this place is pretty gross .
two weeks before they where out of pizza dough at _num_ pm .
that is sloppy , sloppy , sloppy .
customer service is a joke .
i am very disappointed as it is a birthday gift from my husband .
only reason they get one star from us .
zero stars .
service is awful !
i make better alfredo sauce from scratch at home !
the service is a bit sad .
you get eaten alive while waiting for your food .
i agree he is very rude & surly .
i give them no stars .
they obviously have zero concern for customer satisfaction or service .
not pretentious yet homey feel .
now that i live _num_ minutes away , not so often .
here 's why i 'm the most disappointed in this visit .
`` why so much need for car washing ? ''
the other reviews are correct , this place is horrible .
i speak from experience , waste of money .
is there a no star rating ?
_num_ weeks still no word from them on repairs .
the wash is nothing special .
the service is the worst .
$ _num_ gets you a car wash and vacuum - nothing extra .
that is how they get your email address .
no , on second thought , it 's no shame at all .
the shame is on them .
the sad thing is , every woman in our group had the same problem .
first , it is very small .
it is old , think shack .
furthermore , my dad looks at everything before taking it in .
fourth , oil level is low !
the associates program is no longer an option .
this place is a total scam !
this place is just bad news .
_num_ days pass , nothing in the mail .
the nails are sloppy , sharp and uneven .
they are still in pretty rough shape -- -- use caution at this salon !
the guy that did my acrylics was as rude as they come .
meh , it 's too `` this is my new haircut '' scene .
seriously - this place is too cool for itself .
mediocre is a compliment for what my family and i just ate .
the food here is uninspired , bland , and borderline gross .
they have it all wrong .
the prices here are way too high for what you get .
this includes two entrees , a pitcher of sangria , and an appetizer .
overpriced menu and they wonder why it is half empty on a friday night !
the others are just ok .
after two bites , i quit .
maybe he gets into trouble for not immediately filling up waters or taking plates ?
please avoid this place if you value your health .
ra is awful .
no serious complaints about the food , but the service is just atrocious .
the only thing they have that i adore is their iced green tea .
( hence the _num_ stars ) .
however , the prices are very reasonable for lunch .
i wait _num_ minutes for my food , which tastes fine to me .
there 's plenty of better sushi places in the valley .
the sushi itself is nothing special .
way too noise !
this place sucks .
the service is horrible .
the vegetarian selections here are slim .
`` yeah , but it 's only like _num_ % eel .
well , thank goodness i 'm only a _num_ % vegetarian , right ?
actually , just keep walking .
ra sushi is so-so for sushi .
that is completely unacceptable and unprofessional .
the food sucks , the drinks suck , the atmosphere sucks .
however the customer service is a bit lacking .
your specials are atrocious .
first thing first , i 'm from chicago ; i love ra .
so that makes it comes down to the customer service .
the staff is rude also .
service- this is by far the worst thing about this restaurant .
this is a total failure of this restaurant design .
the sushi is just barely above average .
my main complaint concerns the portions of food .
place is dingy , especially for it being in scottsdale .
ok , so this hostess brings silverware , chips and menus at different times .
honey , i 've had better mexican food in dc .
so , they alone deserve a star .
i mean , really atrocious .
you 're better off at taco bell .
too bad cause we 're locals who love mexican food .
this place makes its money on the tourists coming to spring training .
it 's too bad because i love mexican food .
thank goodness there 's a mcdonalds on the way home .
now we are regular restaurant patrons .
one plus is they have pitchers of beer and margaritas .
green is almost flavorless in comparison .
f & l 's is decent , but not my cup of tea .
my two sons and daughter in law are all still sick .
with a lot of options , this place is a no go .
rice was a little dry , beans okay .
that just seems plain lazy to me .
the only nice thing is the patio .
i said to the employee , `` i know bruschetta are twice baked cookies .
this place gets _num_ stars from most .
dead , but still ants .
, i am disappointed in the service and the cleanliness .
service is poor .
so there you have it , even the beer was disappointing !
it 's a shame .
i see a kitchen nightmares in it 's future .
there are far too many better mexican restaurants in the area .
too bad the food is less than average .
this is a sad review for me .
no shit , it 's lasagna .
for me when it comes to pasta , i am a bit picky .
save your money , there are several better choices within walking distance .
ruins the meal .
uh , i know i 'm heavy .
call me picky , but i like cheese on my pizza .
they have no `` signature '' pizzas , it 's all build your own .
although the former is tasty , the latter is a waste of tomatoes .
i just usually avoid it because i feel it is too expensive .
there are no appetizers , just salads for starters .
the red sauce has no flavor .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
_num_ stars only because our server was cool .
this was very disappointing especially after now reading about how good their food is .
in keeping with chain restaurants style , the food is very unimpressive .
other than this , the pizza is like the original .
after our visit yesterday i am still disappointed !
which tells you i 'm tired of it .
it 's expensive but not worth the money .
as _num_ year patrons , we are no longer supporting their establishment .
the service is outrageously bad .
the other people in my party agree that the restaurant was terrible .
just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude .
this place sucks anyway . ''
no lie _num_ dollars for _num_ ravioli .
service is garbage .
this place is horrible .
then my review has served its purpose .
i am so disappointed .
this is college cafeteria italian .
nothing is worse than overcooked chicken .
the owner is a complete jerk and a drunk .
the servers are very unfriendly .
i 'm in total shock .
insulting , dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke !

this restaurant needs new management .
i now see that this slow service runs through all the yelp reviews .
as it stands , it 's only ok at best .
however that is where all the good ends .
however , this place really needs new bartenders .
it 's so weird .
okay , that is one star too many .
stay away from this place unless you are friends with the karaoke mc .
the food at this place sucks , their bartenders suck .
service at this place is terrible .
unfortunately , it looks like it .
my daughter is nine and already very serious about her art .
they feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish .
it only gets worse .
denied service because our party of _num_ is too big ?
( _num_ minutes later i catch her walking by . )
$ _num_ plus a plate and we wrap our own leftovers ?
they are all way too heavy .
i really miss the grilled lamb sirloin .
management is terrible .
so whose fault is it again ?
the long anticipated review of chances are .
it 's horrible .
it 's a bar surrounded by tables on an ugly concrete floor .
still think $ _num_ domestic drafts for this place unreasonable .
the beer selection is pitiful .
is it better than being late ?
now he just waits in our driveway until i get home .
any time there 's a new song , i never hear it ever again .
so there goes my `` shop local '' thing .
the atmosphere is boring and generic .
i have no idea how this place has a four star rating .
my hotel room coffee has more bite .
there is absolutely no sense of urgency here .
six months later i get a bill for $ _num_ .
they are nine west boots , worn one season .
ugh , this place is terrible !
its salty and very flavorful , but somehow it just tastes off .
it 's like licking a salt lick ... .
many fast food places have a reputation of messing w/ cops orders .
forget them twice , shame on me .
the third time and pei wei is officially dead to me .
epic fail for this pei wei .
i feel sorry for the young employee working the register .
it 's a tuesday night and the place is totally empty .
ugh , this place is just terrible .
as to the food , it is hit and miss .
the decor makes absolutely no sense .
there are better places here in arizona that actually care .
the place is busy on wednesdays and fridays .
tiny scottsdale women who barely have a bump ?
this is usually my favorite steak house for the money .
they only have _num_ taps and _num_ of those are bud .
the starting prices of steaks here are $ _num_ just for the meat .
the garlic toast is greasy and kid food .
the steaks are grocery store quality .
what 's the big deal about a twice baked potato ?
drinks are cheaper too .
zero stars not accepted , sadly as that is , my rating .
this place has very bad customer service !
ii mean every _num_ inches .
the office chair upholstery is pretty nasty as well .
slightly below room temp is all your getting out of their current appliance .
if you value your sleep find another hotel .
they are dishonest !
the ladies that work there were old and not very friendly .
they are very dishonest .
why , oh why are they so condescending ?
what am i , chopped liver ?
this is where things get interesting .
in other words it 's a fake !
otherwise , items are hit and miss .
north scottsdale location is terrible !
they are a used clothing store , and _num_ .
it smells awful , old and stale in the here .

this school is terrible .
they have a terrible educational program .
when buying a home , you have a choice .
it becomes a fight with the subs .
the owner is very unfriendly .
the wine selection is average and over-priced .
the are hundreds of better wine stores nearby .
i guess that was my fault .
this place is ridiculous .
that 's a denny 's mistake .
too bad , too , it has a great view .
scottsdale has too many other restaurants that want our money .
trader joe 's frozen teriyaki chicken breasts are far superior .
the state of restaurants in phoenix is pathetic .
i suggest management train their staff and get rid of ones with attitude .
is there a new chef , an incompetent manager ?
nothing ever changes , its always the same over the past two years .
the wine list is only fair .
we order a _num_ korean chicken quesadilla and a _num_ kale caesar salad .

during football season , thursday night is pizza night .
this place is just ok .
gas pumps are very nearly useless .

generally , no one takes responsibility for issues like this .
they are late calling in prescription .
come on guys ... it 's a bruschetta , not sashimi .
these people are the worst .
`` i 'm sorry .
i am sick of this .
avoid this place if you value your guitar .
sitting by the fire pits , listening to the live music is super .
the rooms in this hotel are bad .
the prices they charge are outrageous for what you get .
i am over _num_ feet tall as well as my two boys .
the rooms are musty and old with dirty carpet .

even though they charge a $ _num_ resort fee .
the toiletries they supply are of poor quality .
here 's my issue and yes , i am partially the blame .
at check-in , i mentioned i have a _num_ lbs dog .
at $ _num_ it 's overpriced and uncomfortable .
not more than _num_ stars .
i give this place zero stars !
this hotel has terrible service especially at the pool .
the biggest lacking feature is the most important - the rooms .
the hotel is very very old .
internet is abysmal and spotty .
the worst motel _num_ is better kept up than this .
it smells like old people .
same goes for the rest of the food .
their margaritas are flavorless and weak .
there are too many other choices around there .
just replace it , it 's only _num_ bucks .
i was like , you have black chain ?
that 's just bad workmanship .
dinners are all ala carte .
no let me guess what you have !
when walking in , the decor is old and drab .
pathetic times _num_ !
just fyi , it 's mostly an older crowd .
my advice if you go : try the mozzarella salad .
there is a $ _num_ charge for sharing anything .
there are no potatoes or mashed .
given my experience , i now have reservations when reading yelp review .
like an item , they charge you anyway .
no service , no one cares !
there is no excuse for this .
very limited menu is uninspired .
like an item , they charge you anyway .

it is down the road from our house .
surprisingly , i am giving this place _num_ stars .
the decor is blah .
there are many other italian restaurants that are better than this one .
note : this review only includes a review of my entree .
my issue is with the professionalism of the staff .
it 's just a kid for crying out loud .
sad , i miss the old days .
bathrooms are filthy , which makes me nervous about food safety .
i ordered a glass of dessert wine that compliments chocolate .
the food is ordinary ... no comparison to the capital grille or others .
shame on you ruth 's chris steak house , and your chef as well .
probably not the most amazing first experience i 've had at a restaurant .
too bad there 's really no late night spots in the valley .
in my opinion this salon is dark and outdated .
this place is out of control lol !
_num_ comes still no pizza .
i worked in pizza biz do by this time there was probably one driver .
customer service is awful .
now to the ugly about this place ... it 's grossly overpriced .
it 's a shame management is so nasty and nickel and dime .
in the end , you realize , your child is just a dollar sign .
wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
some place where they really want your business .
lon 's , here 's some advice from the cheap seats .
it is beyond frustrating and not worth the hassle .
three of three strikes , shame on us for giving it another shot .
the circle k in the same plaza has bigger cups for _num_ cents .
the lo mein has horrible , bland , no flavor even with extra sauce .
it 's just gross .

the owners are so cheap they never turn the ac on .
which makes me angry .
parking is crap .
you get the full pat down .
alcohol is expensive .
the theater has no seating as well .
however , this place really does suck .
the simple reason is that the sound quality is terrible .
acoustics are poor as well as the ventilation in the place .
let 's count the ways in which the marquee theater sucks .

the only thing marquee has going for it is size .

in terms of customer service , they 're less than stellar ... for sure .
the wings are mediocre .
the pizza here is horrible .
gus 's never ever surprises me anymore .
people , the pizza here is just plain bad .

i think that there are way better viet places not very far away .
he then takes me menu right off my hands .

the food here sucks .
the alternative copy shop is just that , an alternative .
$ 15-20 quote that becomes $ _num_ actual price ?
coffee is weak .
if you go - maybe stick with the eggs max with chorizo .
i get the draw of this place though .
i give it _num_ greasy spoons .
not anything great like other reviews claim .
this is just a typical greasy spoon hole .
i have had better greasy spoons , much much better .
the food is average to less than average quality .
first impressions are everything and mine was weak .
that 's ridiculous !
are these people dumb ?
it is a hole in the wall kind of place .
the attitude is very bad .
the station 's understanding of new jazz is far off .

i take a bite and immediately notice something hard .
i 'm sorry , what ?
_num_ stars because the coffee and doughnuts were still yummy .
what if i change my mind ? ''
assuming it 's the latter , i ask if everything is good now .
i guess thats where the workers get their attitude from .
it 's dirty and run down .
we probably get pizza from here once or twice a month .
their customer service stinks !
staff is very unprofessional .
the lack of professionalism definitely gets annoying .
_num_ pay rates are fair .
even their bar food misses the mark .
we are only _num_ years old .
the room is ok , just ok , not offensive , nothing special .
also , walls are paper thin !
the biggest thing that i hate about the hotel is the valet service .
my two star goes to the terribly unhappy woman that works behind the counter .
it makes your customers uncomfortable .
the food here is only mediocre in my opinion .
so this review is for you , your service is horrible .
the apartment is small and plain .
i walk my dogs the same route every day .
last but not least the management is horrible .
this place provides a roof over your head -- nothing more .
this place has zero customer service .
which is $ _num_ each .
everything in their store is 2-3 times regular price or online .
also , i am a navy veteran .
it 's the most mediocre pizza i 've had in a while .
the toppings seem ordinary at best .
make jokes after you give me everything i 'm there for .
then getting a refund is another problem .
it kills me how businesses here treat students .
it is busy all night .
i guess the more convenient , the worst everything else gets .
rates are in the sky and management not great at all .
there 's always a pipe bursting somewhere so the waters constantly off .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
the foods gotten really bad too .
this place is downright awful .
a little kindness goes a long way , boys .
this review is for the _num_ star lunch buffet and the _num_ star service .
the buffet is now one of the worst indian buffets in town .
the service guys and manager have no sense of manners .
when serving water , they have no manners .
the service of this place is very poor .
they serve stale food and the service is terrible .
i 'm really disappointed .
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
service is so horrible .
just not good but i 've had worse .
he says okay your total is _num_ .
i appreciate customer service , and this place lacks it tremendously .
super inconsistent ratings , best approach is just try stuff .
its ironic that the most convenient gym in phoenix is the worst .
the staff is incredibly high maintenance and obnoxious .
it 's only good business .
the dead walk amongst us .
which in some cases is good in others bad so i totally get it .
she says 3-4 weeks out to schedule .
the restaurant is old and outdated inside .
it is pathetic place .
avoid this place if you care about your health .
i give it _num_ star for many reasons .
$ _num_ means nothing .
none of the curries taste like curry .
it all taste like chicken and gravy .
the ambience of the place is bad .
water works for me !
there goes your tip people .
there 's plenty of indian restaurants in the area .
but who gives a crap ?
ugh , i 've had better .
tempe improv is a joke ... literally .
there 's nothing quite like $ _num_ cheesecake or $ _num_ nachos .
for the bad , the food and drinks are extremely expensive .
the food quality is , overall , poor .
these were slightly better than the super pretzels you bake at home .
any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly .
i am actually really sad .
their parking lot is garbage .
it is all ok , not great , but not terrible .
first , parking is a nightmare .
so , i get it .
there are obnoxious people ever where , but here 's the catch .
$ _num_ for an iced tea is absurd .
everything else is terrible .
i think the remodel is great .
ps they charge a _num_ % gratuity no matter what .
you end of crammed against strangers and across from your date .
alcoholic drinks are same price .
seriously , i want my money back .
place is a complete ripoff .
dont waste you 're time .
this is a negative review warning people that they auto gratuity your check .
that 's nearly unacceptable in this day and age . )
the best word for this place is sleazy .
i think that is beyond rude .
is a joke as the drinks are way overpriced .
watch your wallet here and trust no one who works there .
it 's reasons like this that comedy clubs get a bad wrap .
now it 's a major money drain .
aside from the talent the service is pretty bad .
the cookies and brownies get _num_ stars on their own .
this is a typical az hyped up joint .
this place sucks in comparison to most .
nothing about the italian sandwich is italian .
no , it 's worse than that .
yes , it gets worse .
so , sadly , i give the library _num_ star .
so why only _num_ stars ?
it is like an irish tgi fridays .
rula : no , there are no managers here .
much better then , `` this is steve '' .
this place is expensive , especially for what it is .
the food is just ok .
the people that take your money at the front are downright rude .
the new management is terrible .
on wed nights they have trivia at _num_ .
service is so bad .
of course , i have a problem with it .
for your money , go to the george and dragon .
my problem with this place is the bartenders .
the cover is $ _num_ .
this is so sad .
i dunno , there 's this weird vibe at the place .
price : way too expensive for what you get .
this is truly mediocre , yet totally veg , fare .
atmosphere : i have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe .
that 's the only reason the rating is so low .
you hurt my feelings .
there was absolutely no difference in the flavor between the _num_ bowls .
this _num_ star is truly only for the coconut curry .
it 's too expensive for the hype that it gets .
the parking is awful .
the texture is all off .
this is just bad food .
here is an update to my previous praise of green restaurant .
consistency is terrible .
moreover , the salads are noticeably smaller with less fresh greens .
very unprofessional , with little to no knowledge of what customer service is .
there is a goodwill located just down the street ( south ) .
they also have coupons from time to time .
how is that non smoking motel _num_ !
you suck , real bad .
which makes the younger people , sub _num_ , feel uncomfortable and not appreciated .
she is the worst very rude .
everything about this place is disappointing !
instead , they got angry at me for coming in !
this place has zero customer service .
these guys are horrible .
place needs some tlc .
the food is mediocre and pricey .
this is just nasty .
he told me it opens at _num_ .
the general manager , bob , is in serious need of customer service training .
about half of the slides require the use of an inner tube .
the park is older and a little run down .
slides are mediocre .
the place is very rundown , it needs some major paint and upgrades .
i am beyond disappointed .
where is the lazy river ?
also , they put sesame seeds on their bread .
first visit _num_ stars , second visit _num_ stars unfortunately .
the salads are ok , nothing special here .
how the hell does a staple end up in an appetizer ?
you know , the one that 's _num_ for $ _num_ ?
my waiter is the only reason im giving _num_ stars .
the only thing home made here is the mess they made .
first off , the shop is the size of a shoe box .
just say you 're appointment only , or hire more people .
my full set is uneven and lumpy .
owner is rude .
they also allow people in late , which is a big theater no no .
keep in mind , however , that avenue q comes with a traveling cast .
it 's a bit outdated .
this just makes me so mad !
spending _num_ minutes in a line for the restrooms is completely unacceptable .
the levels are usually off .
this theater is a disaster for acoustics .
the building itself is where the problem comes in !
further , the acoustics are terrible .
the venue is in bad need of a thorough renovation .
sound system - the acoustics here are terrible !
the more i go here , the more i hate this venue .
once you arrive , parking often takes _num_ minutes or more .
there is no wait for the men 's room , none .
the acoustics are poor .
is theater etiquette a thing of the past ?
the central air conditioning is terrible .
parking is an absolute nightmare .
the acoustics are beyond terrible despite putting in an expensive new system .
drinks prices are average .
this place is the worst .
however , the security is horrible and power hungry .
however , how does that concern me ?
there 's nothing that special about cue club , quite frankly .
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
it is quite expensive too for what you get .
that 's very expensive for chicken kabob .
how i miss the good old days .
the free chips and salsa are probably from costco .
if you have a hangover and need grease , this is your place .
this place is ridiculous .
the carne asada is totally bland .
taco bell has better tasting beans and rice than rosita 's .
the food is essentially taco bell but more expensive .
there are better restaurants just a few minutes away .
not authentic as they claim .
it was okay , i 've had much better for around $ _num_ .
their happy hour is cheap ( dollar off margs and 1/2 price appetizers ) .
the chips are usually a bit stale .
terrible , this is just about the worst mexican i 've had in az .
quesadillas are extremely lacking .
it 's a shame too , really liked this place before .
this place smells like bug spray .
very rude cashier named angela , i believe .
generally speaking , the hotel is `` ok '' .
so all of the things i look for in a hotel - failed .
there is a little cafe within the lobby that serves only breakfast and dinner .
the tv has very poor reception on most channels .
the air conditioning unit in the room is old and noisy .
poor food quality is common .
come on , mr. hunan , this is the southwest !
sadly i think even pei wei has more flavor .
the food is pretty standard takeout , a little bland for the most part .
the license on the wall reads _num_ .
holy god this is _num_ !
the frozen chinese at walmart is better than this stuff .
this place is a dump and the food isnt much better .
i mean really , really bad .
the food is just not good enough for such poor service .
i hate bad customer service .
all in all , the food here is just `` ok '' .
occasionally , the chicken arrives overcooked and dry .
however , there is nothing particularly outstanding about it , either .
i agree with everyone who says that the onions are way too salty .
the beans are pretty bad actually , as is the salsa .
there is no personality to this part of the store at all .
for me it 's just okay .
i just feel that the food here is mediocre .
if you 're on a budget , however , this is your place .
the only good thing about this place is that it 's cheap .
great for people watching , but unfortunately their pizza is pretty weak .
it is similar to the crust used at peter piper pizza from childhood .
for what you get , it seems a little over priced .
the _num_ goes straight there from slices .
the inside is a little small and crowded and not good for group lunches .
this is a beautiful property with the most obnoxious management .
crappy music they torture me with .
it sucks .
i hate this location .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
never have i a paid _num_ for a worst salad .
the water at this venue is terrible .
the service in the place is awful .
the pita bread is fluffy and soft with a mild flavor .
so what 's wrong ?
ugh these guys are a rip off .
maria the manager is a horrible person .
there are cops here almost every weekend .
for friday hh there is usually a dj .
i 'm all about food though .
this place sucks .
the food is nothing special and the prices average .
i grew up on authentic and traditional mexican food , macayo 's is neither .
the food is your typical mexican chain food .
this place makes me hate mexican food .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
attention , general manager ... ... you have a problem .
this place is pretty disgusting .
the mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy .
dont make the same mistake !
the flavor for the most part , bland .
it 's never my choice .
on its best day this place is mediocre .
their meat is horrible .
first off this restaurant is dirty .
the red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy .
that is ridiculous .
rice and beans makes a bland burrito .
again , gross .
they cost me around $ _num_ .
i come back , the bike 's in the same state .
no other lens rental place charges the price of the lens as a deposit .
sure , some of this is just bad luck .
i feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment .
moreover , they have pepsi instead of coke .
the service at this place is horrible .
evil and odd how that happens .
i avoid this store from now on .
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
the scottsdale waterfront location is even worse .
the wifi stinks , useless really .
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional .
woman who answers the phone having a bad life .
the sales people here are terrible .
it 's very disappointing and upsetting .
staff is rude and not helpful .
this place is a mess .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
they get neither right .
_num_ stars because it 's cheap .
even on that standard , i give it a _num_ out of _num_ .
this place is creepy !
the noodles are huge and gross .
yet i 've had _num_ times better chinese food around the same price .
this place is under new management _num_ .
it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant .
i care about if they fix my car or not .
i know why they have _num_ stars , just because customer service .
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
as i stated above , i find this place disgusting .
the prices constantly change here so beware of that .
except their prices are nearly double a normal store price .
i totally agree with lou on this ... totally overpriced and crappy selection .
people , stick with total wine .
besides being ridiculously rude , they have very inflated prices .
i just feel that in this case , it 's hype .
