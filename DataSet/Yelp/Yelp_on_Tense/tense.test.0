which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
the last months were the worst .
about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
the crust was kinda gooey like .

the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
the answer was none .
1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .

he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
they quoted $ _num_ .
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .

it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
the crawfish itself was small too .
was actually there tonight .
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .

this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .

the food was all good , but terribly overpriced .
justin suggested the macarons for dessert -- they were incredible !
_num_ minutes later there was still no bread and no supper .
being hungry , tired and frustrated we left .
the food was good but not at all worth the expensive prices .
all in all everything was less than acceptable .
it was somewhat dry .
the waitress was a nightmare !
i said nope just a foodie who experienced terrible service and food .
it was worse than the first time .

the problem was the waitress .

i was very disappointed with this place .
sorry but i still feel cheated .
i was very wrong .

the only thing redeeming were quality servers .
went to this place more then 3x 's never had a good experience here .
my friend said , '' i gave you my credit card '' .
gave him a card for _num_ drinks next time .
my last visit , however , really changed my perspective on this place .

why did wayne have me drive all the way back ?
my first ( and last ) appointment with altered ego was yesterday .

unfortunately , that punch line never came .
the whole experience was disappointing .
all this did was turn my roots gold .

_num_ min later he yelled across the bar that our food was ready .
this was so disrespectful the way she talked to me as a new customer .
the staff moving in was horrendous .
i walked in , no welcome or anything like everyone usually gets .
the last time i shopped there was the last straw .
both ignored me .
their brussel sprouts ( on the stock ) gave me food poisoning .
i was very sick for _num_ days .
we were wrong .
the bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything .
the hubs got himself a chocolate bavarian cream croissant .
i was sorely disappointed !
i mean , this was some really , really old jelly .
the vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well .
so i just quickly ordered one and paid .
she then threw my quiche in a microwave .
the veggies were what really got my goat though .
there was more egg than anything .
that croissant was more like bread .
what arrived was the chocolate chip filled one .
i ordered a croissant with no veggies sausage and cheese iced chai latte .
they microwaved my croissant on a styrofoam plate .
it had veggies , chicken , pork and shrimp .
neither of the dishes were really that great .

the room also smelled awful and not all of the lighting worked .
the experience was horrible .
the housekeeping was also horrible .
this not being mentioned was part of the reason why we picked this hotel .
the room was very small , which was fine .
the bathroom was a hot mess .
directly beside my room was a stage .
the same order cost $ _num_ dollars .
went to golden nugget where we spent our money .
the room was straight out out of the _num_ 's .
ridiculously small , the shower had no light , pitch black .
we stayed at the golden gate in mid february _num_ .
first off , we stayed in a deluxe queen room on the 2nd floor .
the bathroom had a sliding door ... not very much privacy .
it was roomy and upgraded ; this was the highlight of our stay here .
that really rubbed me the wrong way .
everyone at the table was noticeably uncomfortable by her attitude .
the entire experience was the most awkward and weird haircut of my life .
the service was bad .
the food was worse .
they did smile while giving us crappy food though .
i called sunday , no call back .
i called monday , no call back .
she stated there was something wrong with his teeth .

she always responded quickly and efficiently .
this was very disrespectful with no regards to my time .
the animal foundation was a terrible experience for us .
when we got it home , it was sick the next day .

i was less than pleased with the shave .
it was poor service ... no excuses .
service also sucked !
bartenders had no system going on and they were everywhere .
when we arrived i was immediately disappointed .
here 's why i gave them one star .
worst phone communication ever and they messed our order up twice .
it was like 6am permanently in this room .
the lighting in the room was horrific !
i only stayed here because a friend referred it .
the reason i chose this hotel this time was for the $ _num_ blackjack .
there was no tickets there for me .
it was worse .
thankfully , this bus was much more spacious .
the bus itself was very old .
for the most part , the passengers were quiet and just kept to themselves .
nonetheless , the reservation clerks were helpful and polite in getting me a ticket .
it left an hour late and the trip took _num_ hours .
i took a transfer bus in los angeles ( la ) .
the trip back was so much worse .
_num_ ) there was a ton of traffic from lv to la .
_num_ ) the second bus arrived .

so i walked to the next employee , an older white lady .
i stayed here for _num_ night .
there was no internet .
i paid for _num_ _num_ piece orders of chicken nuggets and two chicken sandwiches .
it was really disappointing .
uncle joes once gave me the meatball and slice of my life .
pizza was nothing like before .
uncle joe , what happened ?
i immediately informed the bartender of the error .
even the cocktail sauce for the cold shrimp was bland .
the damn beds were too small for two people .
it was a complete nightmare !
secondly , we went to the buffet , which we did daily .
my largest problem was the room size .
even the desserts were no good .
there was no need for that comment .
the staff were friendly and helpful which is why it received _num_ stars .

after a little more research i discovered that reviews on hugo 's were stellar .
the shrimp were small ( far from jumbo ) and dry .
the filets were mediocre .
we also tried the creme brle which was just average .

the seafood trio was also a disappointment .
the crab cake also was a let down .
we had the worst time at hugo 's cellar !
when we saw the prices of the meals , it just got worse .
the only reason that i gave them _num_ stars is because of the service .

the final negative came our last night there .
she was a horrible liar !
the air conditioner was very , very loud .
it got worse !

it was as if she was on medication or something worse .
this bartender really had a bad vibe .

it was depressing .
it was crispy in some places and soggy in the rest .
beer battered shrimp .
think nostalgia went more into the triple d pick than the food .
they used american cheese , no option for cheddar , swiss , etc .
have any of you actually had a stromboli before ?
it was piss poor .
the service was beyond poor and the stromboli was a total disappointment .
beyond that ... it was a total dive .
lets just say it was pure disappointment .
it was so dry and flavorless .
the bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it .
my friends meatball sandwhich was cold .
he only ate half of it because of that reason .
ordered a large pep pizza , chicken tenders , and chilli fries .
not worth the money no matter how cold it was .
simply had no good taste of flair at all .
the seating was very small .
my wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce .
it was very bland and lacked flavor .

the only thing that was pretty good was their egg rolls .
the shrimp fried rice was the smell .
this was a huge mistake .
my appointment was at _num_ o'clock .

the lobster stuffed mushrooms that we ordered were ok .
this particular experience was un acceptable .
the staff was friendly yet extremely rushed .
the fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning .
fortunately for i it was endless shrimp time at red lobster .
the busser was a better `` waiter '' than our actual waiter .
maybe she had a bad night .
laughing , the server pointed to the empty lobster tank .
on the way to our table we counted _num_ empty tables .
we had a party of _num_ ; _num_ adults and _num_ children .

e got the never ending shrimp .
the wait time happened twice .
our waitress was very slow .

everything about it was bland .
it was weird .
it tasted a little bland .
the philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor .
okay well he tells me it was really flavorless .
they were sick for three days with it .
i ordered a beef and cheese sandwich , which was forgettable .
the chicken philly was over priced and under seasoned .
sandwich was super soggy and not enjoyable .
the food the first time was okay , philly cheese with swiss .
unfortunately i was more than a bit disappointed with flavor .
i got the bacon and swiss cheese steak .
sandwich was just alright .
placed a order for wings french fries and fried green beans .
they sucked !
so i really really really wanted a philly cheese steak tonight .

the first thing i noticed was that she orders lots of tests .
i was grossly too slow on giving up on her !
well the fat older lady just completely lost it .
( a room across the hall also complained of stolen items ) .

our first night there was absolutely terrible .
overall , i expected a lot more from this hotel .
this was a terrible decision .
it was a truly strange and awful experience .
overall : the rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling .
this was my 6th or 7th visit in _num_ years .
i stayed at this hotel as a week from my parents ' timeshare .

what really bothered me about this place ( more than already mentioned ) .

the chicken wings were way too sweet .
it 's a disappointment that the service was subpar .
the waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering .

silly , i know , but i felt really bad .
unfortunately , my experience was this .
we paid $ _num_ with a _num_ % discount .
some of the figures were so life like it was creepy .

the $ _num_ steak was tough .

there were only about _num_ tables occupied .
this was the cause for me giving them _num_ stars before .
i thought wrong .

awesome deal , but if only the quality was as good as the price .
service was slow !
so , we got there around 8:30 pm .
my order was horrible .

just disappointed all around .
the amount of homeless people laying around outside was appalling .
too bad the rest of the experience was bad .
he suggested ellis island casino , which brews its own beer onsite .
which was a good idea , because the beer was a disappointment .
rather , it was just flavorless .
i ordered it anyway with instruction that bacon not be brought out .
the second beer i ordered was the ipa .
karaoke _num_ nights a week !
much to my disappointment it was below mediocre .
when i got to my second group , i noticed very very angry faces .
the steak was too dry .
this was our first stop this past weekend .
the place was pretty empty when we got there , around 4pm on friday .
it was ridiculous .
not cool even if it was management .
pork chop with eggs was dry .
several regulars went before us _num_ times before our group went once .
all also had a slightly off aftertaste .
you had me at $ _num_ when we met in _num_ .
so i ordered the $ _num_ steak and eggs , medium well .
i also had scrambled eggs , country potatoes , and toast .
the kicker is that the bbq cafe was half empty .
i grabbed an ipa which was disappointing .
i never in my life had a horrible experience like yesterday on easter .
our third meal went pretty badly .
the chicken parmesan was extra salty , the pasta was way overcooked and soggy .
the service was so slow !
he also had the quesadilla , that was o.k .
so she took it off the bill for us .
it was the only time in weeks it was out of my sight .
what was horrible was their service .
_num_ smile , she had none !
_num_ follow ups , which she failed hard !
this place is aweful , everything about it was horrible !
how wrong we were .
a few of them ordered the same thing as me .
my eggs were cold and his steak was very salty .
everything was wrong .
the fried chicken was very good , however not worth the _num_ minute wait .
the biggest problem was the service .

we ordered the new york strip , baked potato and shrimp .
cost was $ _num_ .
there was too much dressing on the salad .

no big deal i thought at first .
so on top of being a little creepy , he dropped this bomb .
i was already disappointed !
everything had potatoes in it , too much potatoes if any .
sure ... i ate ... i was hungry .
it was just that ... food , and nothing else .
i was very disappointed because as i walked in i noticed the buffet line .
the only yummy thing was the tangy mango lassi .
if it was , it didnt taste like what ive had before .
the decor of this place was so dated .
im assuming they went buffet style b/c of the lack of business .
besides being very bland there was a serious issue of meat !
believe me it was nothing like that .
the menu was ok nothing fancy for the price you pay .
worst food we had in vegas .
also the parking lot was empty .
the naan was sub-par ; more burnt air bubbles than anything .
finally , the plastic silverware was just too much .
the service was very poor , the atmosphere very average .
food was cold and service was slow .
money wasted !
the bill was $ _num_ for _num_ tiny bowls of food and three beers .
unfortunately , this spot was very disappointing : overpriced and subpar .
first off it was cold .
even that was an ordeal .
unfortunately , there was nothing of the sort on the saturday night i went .
the smell was bad in the bathrooms and in the casino .
since circus circus bought this place , its gone downhill .
this place is no longer was it once was .
there were plenty of tables , numerous bottled beers , and slots abound .

too bad ; it was a happening place before .
it was pretty bad , though .
there were maybe _num_ people in the casino , including me and my date .
the line for dinner was _num_ yards long .
because dinner took so long our reception went past the expected end time .

some people cant afford a $ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ tab .

this place was terrible .
either way the food was bad .
really disappointed they kicked a players parents off the course .
saw the marshall hitting balls in all directions from a t box .
overall it sucked .
some of the tee boxes were simply awful .
finished in _num_ 1/2 hours .
so you either hit a hole or a patch of grass or both .
i needed a quick dinner so i ate in the coffee shop .
casino games were boring and none of the arcade games worked .
just returned from riviera where i attended a conference .
however , it was always dark and cold .

instead of a westin , it was more like a best western .
the hotel was also oddly less than pristine .

the real disgusting dish was the veal though .
it was such a waste !
service was okay - not bad , not exceptionally good .
the bread was even worse than that .
when my food arrived , my eggplant parmesan tasted like charcoal .
in that case , it was a horrible dish !
just before dinner arrived another server brought our drinks .
i was like `` hell yeah , i 'm there ! ''
they left a bad taste in my mouth for life !
sadly , it never came .
yet when our entrees came , there was pasta in it .
the sauce was weird tasting .

so once again left there very unsatisfied .

my wife and i went there saturday night .
one of the pasta dishes was very undercooked .
the baked ziti was extremely dry , very little sauce .

a short time later , more servers arrived with the last of the entrees .
my biggest complaint was with the staff .
as for the quality of service , it was mediocre at best .

the coconut shrimp was so-so , nothing special .
the alcoholic beverages were boring or too sweet .
the food and service this past week when we dined was awful !
note that both were decent , not good .
the only thing i thoroughly enjoyed was the mocha java shake .
i sucked it all down within minutes .
everything else with seafood or meat was around the $ _num_ range or more .
like i said earlier not worth the money unless you want the environment .
it was probably _num_ minutes before the waiter came to the table .
thankfully , it was quick and painless .
the rest of the visit was a sad experience .
it tasted like a cheap bake at home frozen pizza .
this was a really bad experience .
in general the food was awful .
it was by far nowhere near worth the money !
our only option at the time was rainforest cafe .
the fries with it were just kinda sad , and a little bit cold .
the rainforest cafe had some of the worst service .
for dinner he got dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets .
even after my wife and i split an entree we still paid a fortune .
the service , however , was great .
i went with a group of _num_ on a tuesday night .
i was unhappy with the service and the choice selection of the menu .
we split the turkey wrap as well .

maybe it was because they had _num_ hours until closing but still .
even the miso soup was nasty .
sushi was good but other than that the experience was terrible .
only thing i had here was the hot chocolate .
the sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly .
we also tried their brownie which taste more like fudge .
the moment we walked in , the place looked like a ghost town .
additionally , my husband lost his phone in the store .
all they said was i 'm sorry .
they got my simple order wrong .
the cashier had poor listening skills and no patience in taking orders .
as the other reviewers stated , their food is bland .
no attitude and provided everything i needed .
the worst was the food .
the turnaround was also pretty sad .
nothing , which made me wonder what i just poured all over my sandwich .
pretty bummed that i wasted $ _num_ on this .
chicken philly tasted plain .
it also made me feel extremely uncomfortable .
i had the worst experience here !

then they got some of the orders wrong .
due to waiting some of our food was cold and dry .
however , this cpk was a huge disappointment !

gluten free pizza crust was horrible .
the dining area looked like a hotel meeting room .

the waiter and bus boy , barely spoke english .
one bite confirmed it was gross .
also ordered the pumpkin pie ... it was horrible .
the steak was fine but hardly the best i 'd ever had .
my wife and i went here after reading all of the yelp reviews .

the flavor of the prime rib was also quite lacking .
service was friendly but rather inefficient .

it was a slow tuesday night for heaven 's sake .
he offered dessert , we said no .
like i said , , worst service ever .
we explained , no waitress , no food , no nothing .
the portions were very small .
when we received it , it was lukewarm at best .
the plate was by far warmer than the prime rib itself .
it was like chewing on a rubber band .
this place was a fail in every aspect .
it tasted like a regular steak with little seasoning .
overhaul a terrible food experience but rhonda 's service was great .
the worst dining experience i ever had !
what a load of crap this deal was !
it was cut thick on one side and very thin at the other end .
at the end we were all very unhappy .
went there tonight !
this visit was that .
quite possibly one of the worst services i had in recent memory .

dinner plate appeared sloppy .
mashed potatoes were runny .
side spinach dish was weak .
the salad , meat , and potatoes were very bland .
service was slow with the restaurant being less than half full .

so half our party ate while the other half waited for their food .
drink was light in the alcohol content .
the mashed potatoes & creamed spinach were good .
we also ordered a side of asparagus and a baked potato .
lastly we gave them one more chance with dessert by ordering their creme brle .
tasted like something in an elementary school cafeteria .
when we asked for such a person , they had no one .
the sound system was horrible !
it was awful .
when the salmon finally came it was way too salty .
i had however , never brought a child with me .
it scared the hell out of me !
the place was empty and our table was sticky .

are these people even skilled mechanics ?
i was so disappointed .
then both the manager and the cashier made rude comments .
mind you , this was after already waiting _num_ minutes .
with that said we arrived & i was craving crepes !
when our food came we requested ketchup & steak sauce .
this is where everything went downhill .
my husband order was fine but my wasnt .
it literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top .
and that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper .
according to some friends at another table , she asked `` really ? ''
anyway , i asked for the free kid 's discount .
horrible customer service experience without even getting my nails done .
by far the worse experience i had !
we found them outside in full sun dry as a bone .
they also never gave me my copy of the receipt back .
they lost a customer .
so i walked around until i found the russian sage .
were the ticket people rude ?
were the prices ridiculously high ?
not that the quality of art was bad .
my mom had baja enchiladas which she loved .
the salsa served with the chips was less than stellar .
- i had _num_ chicken enchiladas .
the chips were very pedestrian .
stopped here for dinner the food was below average as was the service .
however , it got worse !
the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada .
everything else was meh .
our food was terrible ( overcooked , etc ) .
i was part of a party of _num_ that met for lunch here .
the service was very slow .
wish the flavor was better .
the food was mediocre and not worth the high price .
the food was so bland , with no seasoning .
presentation was very boring as well .
we stopped by here for dinner with our friend who lives near by .
i ordered the grilled salmon with green enchiladas .
our margaritas were weak , with way too much sour mix .
our mean was mediocre .
the chips were excellent , the guacamole was just average .
the rest of the food was mediocre at best .
it was awful .
the first sign was the chips & salsa .
service was slow and not at all friendly .
the whole dish was just blah .
it was more like a giant hamburger stuffed burrito .
staff was fine , we were in and out .
this occurred _num_ years ago .
he was in really bad shape .
i boarded my dogs for 3-4 days while i was out of town .
when they opened .
he gave me some meds .
he was stable after the _num_ hours .
this time the staff was so unprofessional .
i lost my best friend .
it was $ _num_ .
when the person answered the phone , they were completely incompetent .
we ordered _num_ pizzas _num_ different names they only allowed _num_ pizza .
that 's where the good part stopped , though .
the food was ok enough , atmosphere was ok enough .
my husbands food was greasy and too salty .
the service was nonexistent .
the tables were greasy and smelly .
the ribs were plentiful and dry .
the food tasted stale and old .
fried green tomatoes were ok but again no seasoning .
the greens i had with my meal were older than a few days .
i ordered seafood gumbo and crab legs appetizer .
my friend ordered fried catfish and fries .
gumbo was just okay .
the rest were ice cold at the bottom and lukewarm up the rest .
staff was friendly and welcoming others as we left .
my corona was nice and cold so a star for that .
it tasted like frozen food deep fried in questionable grease .
i totally lost my appetite .
my guess is that half of them were ranch and the other half italian .
fortunately it was only $ _num_ so yeah maybe it just was cheap wine .
that was in _num_ .
`` , she said no just water and tea .
came here because of all the good reviews .
i never ate such disappointing food like this and tough steak in my life .
no call , so i called again .
i brought my car in for a simple fix not motor related .
though the test drive went well , not much else did .
after shopping around online , i saw this accord that i liked .
he was really mad .
i got online , the email matched what the biz card said .
she then transferred me to the service department .
next , he gave me a transmission flush .
it was very convenient being that it was the closest location .
_num_ hour wait for an oil change .
honda west almost killed me !
i used the car for free for a week .
the missing part that bothered me the most was the wheel lock key .
was my safety meant anything to the dealer ?
where the hell did the other $ _num_ come from ?
after reading reviews , we noticed some the same suspicious stuff .
one guy that worked there asked me what i was there for .
it was brutal .
friday night it got worse , running hot continuously .
fast forward _num_ days and the check engine light came back one .
only plus side was that they had cold water !
then they sent the info over .
at this point it was on day _num_ after i bought the used car .
then it was $ _num_ when i got there .
given history with them i left without making the repair .
after picking up my honda later that day they told me they did a .
i brought my car to honda west because its still under warranty .
the manager was just as bad as his staff .
i really felt bad in doing business with honda west .
purchased a car on _num_ june .
replaced under warranty .
either way they lost a customer .
the finance manager gave me a run around .
the doctor on the other hand had a terrible bedside manner .
not a long wait which was great .
asked me no questions at all .
he saw us as a check not a patient .
later on i received a bill for $ _num_ for my service .
what a lazy , answer - i was furious !
the meat was good but not as much as it was in the past .
no dessert and we still rolled out of there full .
place was empty all night .
friendly staff and good food but the wait time was unreal .
after ordering we waited _num_ mins between food deliveries .
total time in restaurant was _num_ hrs _num_ mins .
went there with my hubby and daughter on a saturday night .
the place was virtually empty !
it was about _num_ pm on a weeknight .
giving _num_ star because of the rude service we encountered .
it and the waitress was a terrible and disappointing experience .
finally a drink , your tip went from zero to one dollar .
left that with the rest of the trash on the table .
all of it was absolute crap !
it tasted horrible !
3rd time i went we did the whole experience again .
this was sooooo awkward for us !
the food was once again just like the last time ... mediocre .
they put no love and care into it !
well starting two years ago his service was horrible .
second , there was always something very wrong about one of the pups haircut .
i went straight to the vets office , id rather be safe then sorry .
a few mins later , she brought me the beef w/ broccoli .
as far as the quality of food was just terrible .
the hot & sour soup was mostly liquid .
the beef w/ broccoli was very plain .
this place did no such thing .
there was barely any mushroom and almost no cheese in it .
the black female employee told me _num_ more minutes .
the sauce was burnt as was the meatballs .
that was just money in trash .
the turkey was nothing special .
ordered a salad , not enough meat or sauce on top .
i made the mistake of buying some major appliances through home depot .
associate was an ass with an attitude .
after two weeks there was no response .
so we stood there waiting for about _num_ minutes until someone finally helped us .
it was just `` eh '' .
i then lost all interest in the class .
two weeks after that , i made a phone call , leaving a voicemail .
they quoted me a $ _num_ per person .
what ever happened to customer service ?
i waited for _num_ minutes and still nothing !
i really was about too go off or walk right out the door .
finally , we just left .
i only learned there was a problem when it was mia _num_ days later .
this was the 2nd time going there and the staff was less than helpful .
i ordered the kabob platter which was very bland .
the waiter then very quickly returned with the correct order .
service from that point was a slow and lacking .
after he took our order , he literally disappeared .
ate here recently .
second , the service was terribly slow .
it was quite a late dinner and the cafe portion was pretty empty .
it was hot and only hot , no flavor .
the food was ... not good .
he was prompt though .
so so service , ok ambience , food was bad .
this was our favorite greek restaurant .
long story short , their awful customer service cost me business .
food was cold and lacking of flavors .
as i said , best ever !
both dishes prepared with quality veggies .
the house chow fun was also superb .
my appetizer was also very good and unique .
they also served brown rice for an extra charge .
it was delicious !
all was hot and good .
