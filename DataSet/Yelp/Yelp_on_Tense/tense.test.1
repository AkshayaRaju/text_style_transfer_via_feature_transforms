the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?

the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .

their sandwiches are bad and over price .
on top of that , the service is very slow .
the service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty .
excuse me , is that how they wait tables here in az ?
the food : this is the reason for the low rating .
this place is just way too big .
it was an event day on mill which means parking sucks .
the famous `` roman bread '' is nothing special .
on the bright side , the place is pretty cheap .
the shrimp salad is so-so .
atmosphere is ok.
my main complaint is the slow service and confusion on the server 's part .

you want your check before that point , usually .
if smoking bothers you avoid this place .
the food is so blah !
i 'm a total foodie ... see my reviews .
my friends orders a seafood dish with various small chunks of dried out seafood .
granted , this is a college town .
it misses the mark in many small ways .
it just needs a little better attention to details .
not a big deal , it happens .
i ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side .
there are so many better places around mill .
that 's why i think its shady .
this store is a poor excuse for a japanese market .
they are complete assholes .
buying pants from here is less reliable than goodwill .
the others are rude as shit .
you only accept ugly clothes .
this place is awful .
there service is snooty and horrible and almost everything is way over priced .
i very rarely find anything here that i like .

thirsty thursday is the only thing going for this place .
this place is a hell hole .
this is probably the worst barber shop .
there is many collision center in phoenix .
until now that is .
here 's where it goes bad .

they just never have that juicy medium rare middle that i long for .
second , my dad makes better burgers .
the chuck box makes a good boring burger .
they fall short of their topping options .
i think they like the idea of the place more then the actual food .
the worst part is a hide behind honesty when their just full of crap .
customer service and attitude of employees is awful .
you are nasty pete , especially here in tempe .
they charge extra for their bad tartar sauce .
you 're better off going to long john silver 's .
then why is the food so expensive ?
bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries _num_ star .
this location sucks balls .
also the red sauce ... yeah it 's gross .
why are they so damn rude ?
the downtown mesa location is like another restaurant .
that 's like no big mac at mcdonald 's !
this new breading is gross .
this place is what gives fast food a bad name .
all the bad reviews on this place i agree with .
upon having the car , oil changes takes a really long time .
that 's right , the actual dealer was better customer service than these people .
he is in no way professional .
*** trails is the walmart of head shops .
which to me is a no no .
get back to the office which is only _num_ minutes away and dug in .

working in the industry , i know these prices are ridiculous .
a ) drinks are extremely weak .
it 's very close to airport , which equals noisy !
the entire lobby is a disaster .
it 's a disaster .
not marriott standards ... or maybe it is .
caffe boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day .
oh , yeah , i get it .
now they have a handful of their worst ones .
the prosciutto and melon is pretty weak , as is the cheese plate .
once again , i stand my my award winning wine list .
it looked like they have less pasta too .
i want my old caffe boa back !
i miss my old modest reliable boa .
this new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food .
the food is just ok - rather average .
the menu is kind of limited .
this place sucks .
what 's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab .
a half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch .
i mean honestly , $ _num_ for their `` special fries ?
i brought some leftovers home ... you want some ? ''
$ _num_ for an appetizer size bowl of soup is absurd .
food is acceptable , service is terrible .
really , caffe boa , you know better .
i am very disappointed caffe boa !
there are much better restaurants in the area like house of tricks .
_num_ dollars + _num_ dollars for meat for my pasta dish .
none of the ingredients matched what we read .
so , we arrive , after making a reservation for _num_ .
to me , here is where it got a bit frustrating .
ridiculous i say !
the only reason this place gets _num_ stars is because of the interior .
there are better options in neighboring scottsdale or even in tempe .
im not sure why they even open the doors anymore ?
she brings my tea and _num_ packages of sugar .
if you 're a vegetarian , skip dinner .
however , their service is truly terrible .
butter lettuce , walnuts literally that 's it with salmon .
anyway , bill comes & there 's a $ _num_ charge for the wine .
no one is here anthony says .
no one is ever here this early .
still exists from this delay and poor customer service .
if like leaving a restaurant unsatisfied , this is your place .

worst thai food i 've had -- nearly inedible .
this place is all about big mediocre portions .
ill never return !
not sure why people like this place so much .
i 've eaten lots of thai food and this place is less then memorable .
their food is average however the way they run their business is awful .
dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what i received .

believe me , there is no next time .
first off i am _num_ , but no stick in the mud .
swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store .
everyone else stay far , far away .
but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry .
food , service , parking and decor are horrible .
the inside looks like a haunted house and the outside is a complete wreck .
it is busy all the time though so someone likes it .
this review is long overdue .
management says bartender made a `` judgement call '' .
management sucks .
i 'm glad i trusted my gut on this one .

stop raising our rates you douche bags .
they charge an initial $ _num_ deposit .

that 's your warning .
so , why _num_ stars ?
what the hell is that about ? )
the decor is the only thing this place had in common with it .
i wish the experience was better than it was .
the food and the service at this `` restaurant '' are equally terrible .
the food is very bland .
food is very bland .
this place in general is a little too cheesy for me .
they offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff .
the food itself is just ok .
the reason for my _num_ stars is because of the service .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
it 's way too loud .
just make sure you 've eaten dinner before you go .
so far the worst italian i 've had in the valley .
this restaurant deserves no stars .
the house salad is really poor .
forty dollars and tip for a meal this bad is ridiculous !
it 's a little expensive for a dive bar too .
that is just flat out nuts .
if these prices seem just a little high , its because they are !
this place is overpriced and not very good .
crust is tough , toppings are minimal .
never again folks .
the taste is where it all fell apart .
this place is an insult to italian pizza .
i guess polish beer for the polish owner .
which seems like quite a hefty price tag for literally not doing anything .
i guess you get the price you pay for .
the breakfast is mediocre at best .
anyways , the rooms are cheap for a reason .
the topping bar is so simple and plain .
cookies taste raw and boring .
this place is horrible !
the bad parts are that the entire restaurant was dirty !
this is an utter insult !
the store itself is dirty on the outside , as well as the inside .
quite rude i think !
rather upsetting because they are soooo cute .
jenny is very rude !
its not worth it .

all of the negative reviews are _num_ % accurate .
just as nick wrote , jordan is awful .
they run all their loud equipment before sunrise .
you tell mike , he makes excuses .
then , there are the tenants .
this place is awful in every way imaginable .
the staff is rude and extremely unhelpful .
this one have terrible crappy food with the worst customer services .
their customer service is horrible .
i have ate here before , the food was ok .
one word is gross .
the biggest problem is the overall appearance of the bar .
the food is your average bar food , decently edible .
there are many better sports bars within a few miles of this place .
baseline sports bar is now a newly renovated bar called brick and barley .
my boyfriend is a fan of the draft choices .
the degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here .

the only great thing about this studio is the friendly attitude of the staff .
this place is horrible !
they still use film x-rays -no digital .
einstein bros bagels in tempe is my typical go-to breakfast spot .
if you are a fan of this chain , avoid this location .
everytime i come here they forget something in my order .
slow service , unless you 're a regular .
seems regular customers get more priority .
this is the worst einstein ever .
never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in .
this location is no different .
i mean really , though , two tomatoes and no lox ?
listen to a loud conversation about a guy 's terrible luck .
this place needs a major overhaul .
this place is just nasty all around .
that is poor .
sides are weak .
rib tips have no meat .
i think i also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well .
sad thing is is that i work in the same business complex as them .
their food is terrible !
as bad as the food is , their service is worse !
ribs are flavorless , tough , and chewy .
sauce and sides are just as nasty .
however , what really counts is the food ; which was awful .
no flavor , unless you count the kinda salty ketchup they call bbq sauce .
i think the problem with tom 's bbq is they have loss their touch .
the problem with this place is their drive-thru .
kind of weird as the store seems empty .
lastly , their pet policy is pretty bad .
i 'm angry , upset , and disgusted .
my kids and i hate it here now .
it 's extremely surprising there are no reviews on yelp for this place !
the office does nothing .
everything i stated above is still accurate which is sad .
management is rude and unprofessional .
there is a huge bug problem .
why the heck is that ok ?
the apartments have cheap carpet in them .
this just shows how terrible this dealership really is .
there 's just no follow up .
_num_ different stories , and one or both are lies .
worst service rep ever .
now it is 11:30 and still no shuttle driver .
this place is nothing but a joke .
this dealer is a rip off !
my main issue here is the lack of integrity of this company .
if that 's true , the management here really , really sucks .
everyone car shopping ever stay clear of chapman chevrolet .
everyone is in trouble because of this one car .
this dealership is the worst .
i hate car sales company ethics .
phone etiquette is terrible .
like , are you serious ?
that is horrible .
more than a month later , the car still smells .
i guess it was a bad idea .
this place sucks .
first off , bugs !
i just buy what i like .
completely rude .
super rude and does crappy work .
i get blonde highlights on top and the rest is a dark chocolate brown .
altered ego obviously has an altered sense of the word `` appointment '' .
i just want a haircut . ''
i leave sit in my car and look at the gift card .
i 'm disappointed .
stop sending me emails that you want me back .
tempe is still the neglected one .
yes , this has all the equipment you need for cardio and weights .
locker room is dirty .
how absurd is that ?
its kinda dingy and lacking equipment but is close to home .
so it 's $ _num_ .
warning -- they take no responsibility for their work .
made an appointment online at _num_ am for an oil change at _num_ am .
every other place does includes these services .
customer service is terrible .
rates here seem higher than other places .
i 'm full and disappointed .
the worst is this : they use styrofoam for everything .
makes me sick to my stomach .
no idea how this has such good reviews .
compared to other us cities , this place ranks very low in my book .
the sweet and sour chicken is hit and miss .
this is my second order , and by accident .
and chicken and veg for myself as i only eat chicken fish and turkey .
the fried rice is the worst i ever tasted .
thankfully , tempe has an abundance of chinese food outlets ; goodbye !
there is too much breading on their `` crispy '' teriyaki chicken .
negative _num_ stars !
the portion is unbelievably small , chicken is dry .
the fried rice is white rice with a sauce .
id give it negative stars if i could .
their fried rice equally bland .
this place sucks .
i made a yelp account as i wait for my food at this place .
bottom line , there are better , less expensive options out there .
they charge ridiculous fees when they are the ones who made the mistake .
it 's ridiculous !
the drive through is soooooo slow .
i definitely feel like i wasted my money here .
i am a vegetarian , who even when i ate meat , hated fish .
so i went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch .
if you read this review , please also read nathan 's comment below .
apparently the other baked goods like the scones , muffins , etc .
seriously ... what is wrong with this bakery ?
they microwave their food and the staff is awful .
so why go to a place that blows off your order ?
very over priced and quality is way down from childhood days !
it 's just unfortunate that they are next to a fantastic french restaurant .
the menu says the sandwich comes with bell pepper , onion , and mushroom .
no big deal it happens i 'm sure they used bagged ice .
you are better off eating at a panda express in the projects .
the accompanying photo is of the wong jo chicken from my first visit .
i really think panda express is a lot better than this .
the food is basically flavor less and the meat quality is sub par .
the food is really bad .
panda express is a five-star restaurant compared to this place .
as a chinese buffet , i 've had both better and worse .
however , the condition of the place is my issue .
place has no pride of ownership .
ripped seats , sticky floors , food has little to no flavor .
am i that desperate for your food ?
these guys have no clue .
ok , first off i love pizza hut pizza .
it 's annoying .
getting it wrong from what i read is there specialty .
this shit is awful .
i feel bad that this company represents louisiana in any culinary form .
this place is the absolute worst at customer service & speed .
damn you ace .
some of the staff rude .
soggy french fries fail .
customer service fail .
people behind the counter look at me like i 'm a problem .
why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice ?
it is an unbelievable little place .
battery chains are a dime a dozen .
_num_ stars on service , _num_ stars on availability .
i dunno .
instead , i 'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever .
the service is horrible at this place !
so if you peel the layers away its really not that big .
$ _num_ and i feel like i just ordered a salt lick .
yet , with each visit i am more disappointed .
i like that this filiberto 's is _num_ hours .
my windows look all bubbly and horrible .
if you want thai food hit royal thai grill or thai rama .
overall , if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you .
it 's simple ; are there frozen peas and carrots used in the rice ?
everything tastes over processed .
the orange chicken tastes nothing like orange chick it bland .
the chicken tastes horrible , dry and flavorless .
its already disrespect enough you are in this country .
no lemongrass or nothing thai about it .
they also inform me of delivery times and fees up front .
`` shame on him .
keep in mind , this is still under warranty .
the follow through in the office is terrible .
then _num_ hours labor at $ _num_ an hour .
her tone of customer service is worst .
everytime we go to this dennys we have nothing but problems .
service is awful at this location .
i guess it depends on the day or the technician you get .
very busy place and i question the cleanliness .
it 's like constantly buying things from best buy at christmas .
i 'm sorry .
fry 's is a consistent disappointment .
the check-out line is always long ( or worse ) .
they now price match all online pricing .
she does it again from the beginning ... error again .
agent tells me that not all items are on the same price .
not that they are all like that , of course .
they claim it 's a mistake in printing .
this is totally ridiculous !
these people are dishonest & unprofessional .
this is the worst !
this place basically sucks .
what the hell is wrong with the employees here ?
coming to this place is always slightly disappointing .
only employee that has beard .
the attitude of customer service is shocking .
the aisle with sound bars is a joke .
the service here is so bad .
it stinks !
fry 's electronics has so much potential .
even the cashier has horrible customer service skills .
this place is beyond horrible .
these guys are ripoff artists .
these guys are ripoff artists .
fry 's management , this situation speaks for itself .
anyway , fry 's is official off my list .
frys electronics has become such a disappointment when dealing with their extended warranty .
that 's _num_ minutes on a slow night .
here it is $ _num_ .
that being said , this place is very expensive for no reason .
$ _num_ for a _num_ '' pie is a bit ridiculous .
i feel really bad for them .
this place is an insult to pizza , restaurants , and chicago .
the service has went down hill for me this past year .
the service here completely sucks though .
`` express lane '' is a complete joke .
only shop here because it 's close to my home and easy access .
the damage they caused is over $ _num_ .
this seriously is the worst , i mean very worst fast food place ever .
this is the worst mcdonalds ever .
this mcdonald 's is a joke .
very obvious that this place lacks good management !
pizza is good for cheap pizza .
this location is terrible !
courtesy gets an f rating from me .
it just seems greedy to me .
if you open an account , make sure you know all the fees .
every visit i dread it !
they are the worst credit union in arizona .
they are still the worst probably in the whole us .
do your research before you step into this unprofessional and unethical place .
everything they get away with is wrong .
run to a different place unless you have good lube .
water in the fuel mean all new fuel lines .
phoenix heat is brutal on plastic !
this company is rude , unorganized , and unprofessional .
no such luck so i call them again .
they have horrible customer service all of the employees have very bad customer service .
the store is very dirty .
try another one that has better customer service and prices .

if you need any body work , go elsewhere .
although they let everyone else know they have a _num_ % satisfaction guarantee .
whenever i go in i always buy over a $ _num_ worth of stuff .
they had a sale buy _num_ get _num_ free .

it smells like death .
the employees are rude .
there hours are inconsistent .
this is _num_ .
this is _num_ .
this place sucks .
other places give u tons of onion n few cilantro leaves .
this location is just below standards .
employees really hate their jobs and people .

this review is as of october _num_ , _num_ .
that 's a no .
pickles feel plastic .
fries are tasteless , greasy and i suspect cooked in old oil .
first of all , the burgers themselves are pretty lame .
in chicago , the crust is crunchy and flaky .
it is pizza and when is pizza ever bad ?
however , it is nothing special and definitely below average .
crust is awesome , homemade sausage is fabulous !
their tomato sauce also is flavorless .
even the national chains do it better .
i 'm annoyed that i spent good money on this pizza .
apparently i much prefer ny style pizza , not chicago .
i miss the pizza from my old hood ( aiello 's ) .
no free samples just a decades old video going .
okay very old inside and out even smells old inside .
that 's _num_ of us though .
i am highly disappointed .
this is the ghetto , move here at own risk !

pete 's fish is ok , square , almost like processed but not .
what the hell is that .
this place serves nothing but frozen seafood .
why are people lining up for disgusting frozen fish ?

the fries , onion rings , fish where just gross .
paper basket full of processed fried food is a better description .
they have atm machines outside _num_ of their _num_ locations .
the fries , blah soggy and sometimes cold .

1st and only visit that 's for certain .
service is terrible .
albertsons has the same tasting fried chicken .
another cave creek tourist trap .
avoid if you have taste buds !

this requires little thought .
going through security is a horrid mess .
i mean come on , where is the customer service ?
flying is uncomfortable enough as it is without airport staff being jerks .
maybe , maybe other areas of this airport are nice ... ?
las vegas has a few negatives though .
it has alot of shops and alot of employees .
it 's a mistake !
other than that , it pretty much sucks .
in short , this place is terrible .
tsa personal are rude .
this is one of the worst airports in the us .

well , the airport is dated and dingy .
some of the tsa agents are also rude .
the shuttle shit is so weird .

when you get there , it seems ok .

this airport is just like any other airport if not worse .

it 's no wonder why people drive to vegas from phoenix .
checking in is terrible so go early .

here 's the problem i have , the service is terrible at lunch .
then it goes downhill from there .
chicago joes blows !
food totally lacks in flavor .
the atmosphere is about the only redeeming quality for chicago joe 's .
chicago joe 's is a quaint little italian joint .
the salad and bread are nothing special .
and if you are handicap , forget it if you need the restroom .
ambiance : chicago joe 's is basically in a converted old house .
those dishes are $ _num_ per & way over priced !

this place is the original casino cafe in las vegas .
the atmosphere is nostalgic with old school decor .

the shrimps are small and bland to the point of being almost tasteless .
i really hate how things change so quickly in vegas .
there is absolutely no counter space where the sink is .
the price is very cheap , but not worth it .
only highlight is at night outside this joint .
golden gate hotel wins worst hotel ever award !
`` there are cockroaches everywhere its the desert . ''
so why _num_ stars ?
i have no intention of staying here again .
there 's no pool , no wifi , no spa , etc .

it 's literally _num_ feet from our window .
paying the _num_ % more of the room rate for resort tax is absurd .
this happens no where else .
i hate this place !
ugh , this place is a nightmare .
i believe this is a bed bug infested hotel which requires immediate attention .
the golden gate is a rip off .
check in is 3pm ( like anywhere else ) we arrive at 3pm .
i 'm sorry !

it 's just plain unappetizing .
there 's always good and bad items on all restaurant menus .
this shelter desperately needs better management and a thorough clean up .
this is a kill shelter ... please help get these babies out of here .
the animal foundation is in the pet killing business .
no stars if i could .
that 's horrible !
( beware this post is long ) .
there is no excuse for the rudeness .
it 's horrific !
a short preface : i 'm a dumb ass .
boo for the patrons who also enjoy cheap liquor !
the drinks are cheap .
it is two blocks east of 7th on fremont .
bad kids loud all day and night everyone smoking weed !

also , few passengers are rude as hell too .
are all greyhound bus stations this sad ?
greyhound is the black hole of happiness .
it 's cheaper , but not if they loose all your stuff .
you ppl need some customer service training big time .
you are better off spending the extra money staying anywhere else .
the rooms are sooo old , dark , and ugly .
they have the worst mattresses full of bed bugs .
cons : it 's cheap .
the entire hotel smells like smoke !
in my opinion , the california hotel falls into the latter category .
for me , its like this - there 's a stain on your carpet .
the whole place is dirty and grimy much like the surrounding downtown area .
they charge _num_ per day per device !
this really sucks .
this is poor customer service !
maid service is sloppy .
the only positive is that this hotel is relatively cheap .
it 's decent pizza and quite cheap , especially for vegas .
the positives end there .
they put wings and philly cheese steak on the menu instead ?
this hotel is a run down , smelly , seedy place !
prices are super cheap so , guess you get what you pay for .
casino is nasty .
food is horrible .
drinks are bad .
it 's two spoons of micro shrimp over cocktail sauce over shredded celery .

as for customer service they are very rude !
this casino is horrible !
pool has no appeal .
customer service bad , room service sucks !
they come across as snotty and rude .

that 's it ... no comp or anything .
i thank them for ruining my evening on fremont street .
i am absolutely insulted .
confused , i ask `` is that for us ? ''
i get your message loud & clear , mr. assistant .
i 'm angry just typing this out .
no more hugo 's for us .
this place seriously needs a renovation .
because the secret is they lower prices at the last minute .
even those _num_ table casinos in north las vegas have better rules than that !
it 's like eating cardboard .

the parking attendant then pockets the remaining $ _num_ .
fairly loose slots based on people i know .

the quality of service is next to nothing now .
one star is too generous .
i 'm disappointed .

for _num_ dollars , you get _num_ minutes .
they deserve a gold star .
it is very , very poorly maintained and worn out .
the hotel and casino is very , very outdated .
the smell of cigarettes is every where .
this place is a rip off .
this is the only reason i like this place .
this place is nasty !
the smell is so strange and not good !
they never return your deposit .
everything is old , yet cheap here .
i am really angry at this place .
now they are just out of the way and expensive .
management here is more concerned with policy than guest loyalty .
they have _num_ or _num_ of these machines .
then upon checkout , they charge a $ _num_ resort fee for two nights .
the costumer service of this place is appalling .
they now charge a $ _num_ resort fee ... some resort , wtf .
vintage rooms are above the casino and stairs only , no elevator .
it is a run down casino with old furniture inside the rooms .
horrible place they 're thieves !
the hotel s terrible .
more over the also charge additional $ _num_ for regular amenities .
not that bad you say ?
valet is completely rude .
security and staff are extremely rude .
nothing here worth a second look .
casino is rather small compared to other casinos in the luxurious downtown area .
are you guys stupid ?
no matter what shift .
it 's ridiculous .
so false advertising on all adds .
all of the hipster crap around el cortez .
it 's unfortunate that the bartender is such as asshole .
with all these improvements and the only entertainment is a piano player ?
bed is the most uncomfortable bed ever .
saturday nights are the worst .
old , dingy and not in the center of downtown vegas is this casino .
about _num_ minutes later he brings to salads to them and nothing for us .
the cabana suites are more expensive then the regular rooms .
he then says , ok _num_ dollars for deposit and _num_ for resort fee .
this is just poor poor absolute horrible customer service .
this place is far from mediocre .
the cocktail servers are zombie like .
too bad for this place because i like old vintage vegas casinos .
guess that 's why there was hardly anyone in there on friday night .
avoid this place unless you have no choice .
it is a restaurant chain located inside a casino in downtown las vegas .
the only good point is ... its cheap .
this place is seriously a tourist trap for sure .
if it sounds too good too be true , it probably is .
oh , heaven 's no .
i guess it 's true , you get what you pay for .
meat quality is definitely low grade .
it is horrible !
my wife always gets the same thing ... potato skins and mozzarella sticks .
ribs are over priced and taste horrid .
this is a ridiculous place with ridiculous service .
the buffet in the fremont hotel and casino is much better .
we places our order and the waiter even repeated that back to us .
the waiter then asks how every thing is .
umm wtf kind of crap is that ?
in summary , tony roma 's is a below average overpriced restaurant .
it is a dump in a dumpy place .
btw i 'm a local server for over _num_ years ... .
attracts visitors more than anything is my guess .
this place is horrible !
the sign says tony roma 's but this place is a fraud .
even though the price is low , the special is totally not worth it .
they deserve no stars !
quick stop into the cafe for a quick bite around _num_ am .
skip this place ... unless of course you like cold food and slow service .
i think we had _num_ different servers helping us which confused my party .
the nugget is the vegas capitol of zombie employees .
so we wait .
so i land in vegas , grab my rental and head to the hotel .
thankfully , they let me stay in there this time .
maybe the points system is really that bad ?
this casino really sucks .
this place sucks .
i hate this place .
fault also lies with the hotel .
just remember the money you bring to vegas stays in vegas .
downtown las vegas is gross and filthy as it is .
this just looks so ghetto .
the nugget has a lot of problems .
you get nothing unless you are a guest in the hotel !
steve wynn 's legacy of quality service is long dead .
i have no idea how this hotel has anything above a _num_ star review .
you are better off staying at the worst hotel on the strip than here .
the only thing that is **** at golden nugget are the prices .
downtown is trashy , noisy , dirty .
water is $ _num_ .
the golden nugget is an older hotel/casino on the fremont street area in vegas .
wifi is _num_ ... .
supposedly it , and i quote , `` depends on availability . ''
i give it _num_ stars because of all of the kids running around .
well this place is horrible because its run down by kids everywhere !
i really have no complaints about my actual stay there .
the golden nugget is terrible !
i simply think the _num_ star rating of this hotel is a fraud .
it is less quality than circus circus and much more expensive .
the service is terrible in all the restaurants and bars in the place .
negative _num_ stars !
no , we 're here two more days !
the apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste .
it is a combination of musty and old laundry smell .
why bother ?
the buffet restaurant is really nasty .
the uncaring and apathetic staff here are unbelievable !
there are no comment cards in rooms , i wonder why ?
the casino itself is kind of gross .
worst part is the customer service .
it 's terrible .
this hotel is terrible with even worse service .
check-out , i tell the guy behind the counter .
the only thing nice at this hotel is the pool .
the most horrible experience happened last night ... so here is my warning .
unfortunately this is a theme throughout the entire casino staff .
they are actually fake cameras .
-i like that the elevators in carson and gold tower had no music playing .
this is vegas .
i 'm tired & on dc time in vegas .
so my body clock is at 5am even though its 2am vegas !
my experience is never consistent .
it is barely _num_ blocks from the golden nugget .
we have charges to our charge card that are n't ours .
currently staying here , they offer no shuttle service .
casino is nice but the layout is so confusing .
the tower you book your room is where you checkin .
ok , i let that pass .
horrible attitude , minimal staffing , no management who knows better .
i feel bad for them .
it says a lot about a place when they treat their employees badly .
the valet is the worst !
and the grotto which has horrible pizza .
besides , your entire hotel sucks anyway .
there is no complimentary coffee offered in the room either !
_num_ days go by , nothing !
the pool area is way too small .
their pool areas are more spacious and luxurious .
the coffee in the room costs _num_ for _num_ packets .
lastly their pool is not great and often over crowded .
we have _num_ employees total on this trip .
then there 's this new resort fee .
today is sunday , april _num_ , _num_ .
what a disappointment you are .
the golden nugget has _num_ star rooms and _num_ star service .
my girlfriend and i recently stay here and we had a horrible experience .
there is even a water slide that goes through the tank .
so far ... they are horrible .
housekeeping here is terrible !
pool is cool but annoying with lots of kids .
get in there there 's a crusty dirty towel hanging in the bathroom .
bottle caps at the foot of the bed .
the pool area sucks .
unfortunately their managers are awful , rude and with poor table side manner .
just too many rules with poor delivery find somewhere else .
first of all , the parking is ridiculous .
the parking structure is difficult to access .
the club is the worst club ever .
this hotel , however , is a disorganized mess .
there is very limited seating .
the pool area has _num_ people fighting for _num_ chairs .
downtown vegas is a sleazy rundown dump .
this place is horrible !
bad signage and the rooms smell .
the band at the fremont street experience is way too loud .
i play the slots and poker but never here .
there are better casinos here .
ps long wait for the poker room as well .
that is terrible all i hear is the band outside .
first issue is the check in lines take forever .
second issue , the internet is just awful and so slow .
probably the worst area of the hotel if you have kids .
our room practically shook all weekend from the constant music until _num_ am .
in my opinion , certainly not worth the money for what you get .
there are much better options closer to the strip for comparable rates .
the ventilation system in the casino is horrible .
also it smells like cigarettes ugh .
service is horrible at the bars .
the rooms are a little beat up and super noisy from fremont street .
the manager of the hotel is a absolute joke !
sleeping is a nightmare !
staying at the carson tower is great and cheap .
everything about the golden nugget is a money grab .
however , it 's just kind of dumpy .
_num_ mins later still no bag .
the room keys hardly work .
the buffet food is horrible .
the employees are very rude even the managers .
if you are too cold then they say too bad tough it .
i think strip is better for friendly cocktail servers with customers being first .
ill never step foot in there again .
as far as pawn shop shows go i suppose .
it 's a crappy tourist trap now .
from the store perspective , it is a pawn shop .
the place is far away from the strip casinos .
only go there if you love their show ... .
the parking is an absolute joke .
a & e choose this % # it hole !
some staff are rude .
overall the place is very small and very over priced .
the place is just nasty .
i am def no longer a fan because of my experience just calling them .
i guess being rude to customers is how they do it .
this place is a piece of crap .
they have a whole bunch of crappy overpriced items .
too much pawn stars tee shirts and junk .
it 's just your average pawn shop that looks much bigger on tv .
let me say that none of the cast is here .
the outside is also nothing like it is in the show .
frankly it is a dump with not much of anything for sale .
the tv celebrities no longer work the counters .
if you like long lines and disappointment this is the place for you .
otherwise it looks just like any other pawn shop place anywhere else .
wait times vary from _num_ mins to an hour ( come on , really ?
only the pawn shop section is open _num_ hours .
they are usually in the back doing whatever .
i live here so that 's why i gave them _num_ stars .
it is a small shop with about _num_ employees .
it is very misleading .
i guess they are nice only when the cameras are on .
they only have big ticket items and tv show memorabilia .
one of my friends always makes the worst suggestions .
it 's , uh , it sure is ... small in here .
when the sign outside gold and silver pawn says `` open _num_ hours '' ?
the only reason people visit this place is because of the tv show .
the pawn shop itself is nothing grand either .
it is indeed , just that .
the shop is your average pawn shop a bit dingy and old looking .
it is now like an amusement park .
_num_ % of the store is now merchandise with their faces on it .
it seems that all this place is now is a tourist trap .
small and cramped nothing like what it looks like on tv .
staff there is cold and not so friendly .
sorry customers are such an inconvenience .
the shop is small and unimpressive .
now i think of them as sick and big loss .
the place is very , very small .
jewelry collection is small and not to interesting .
pawn stars rip off artists !
it looks like only about _num_ % of the people leaving bought anything .
disappointing , the place is tiny and not worth it .
like someone else said , half the store is their own merchandise .
this place is just a tourist trap .
more than half the stuff they sell is souvenirs ( junk ) .
the other half is over priced as far as i 'm concerned .
there 's no public bathrooms nearby either , so keep that in mind also .
the worst part is i definitely felt like a stupid tourist .
this place is more for show .
gold and silver pawn shop which is the tv show home of pawn stars .
none of the tv actors are even there .
mostly jewelry coins etc .
nothing like what you see on tv .
employee mike and other employee laugh at me .
the only great thing about this pawn shop is that its on tv .
extremely disappointed in the quality of products this place sells .
i still feel most of the items are over priced .
parking is ample and the staff ... it 's hit or miss .
my wallet is sad now .
it 's just a regular buffet nothing special !
if you like the above mentioned seafood items then have at it .
it 's only $ _num_ .
however if you want good food for a good price go somewhere else .
there is absolutely no taste .
are fresh tomatoes too costly ?
your apple pie has no apples , all syrup filling .
chicken , ribs , most meat dishes are tough and dry .
frozen chicken patty that you call chicken parmigiana .
is it horrible .
even the country style hash browns we 're some frozen crap .
asked for chocolate milk and they only have plain milk .
prime rib is the only decent dish .
rice dish sucks , even breakfast eggs has weird taste .
first off , sushi which is currently my favorite buffet food was nonexistent .
the real problem is just old outdated buffet one that not with current times .
i guess they only open it for lunch/dinner .
one of my favorites is the oxtail stew which was at least _num_ stars .
food is poor and cheap .
these guys play the bitter old i hate women card .
i 'm a poor college student who never ever carries cash .
i didnt say anything but didnt think this was fair ?
if it comes down to this venue or another , select the other option .
just keep in mind there 's no shade .
i am very disappointed !
`` neon '' museum yet none of the signs work !
-the location is obviously very inconvenient .
with what they charge , i wholeheartedly disagree .
i am thankful for the free ice packs they gave my grandparents .
the tour is so boring .
my _num_ star is for the old lady behind the counter .
place looks worn .
finally , the rooms ... beds are terribly hard and smells of mold .
they need an update badly !
the parking situation is a wreck .
it is crowded and hot and loud and a drunk group of travelers .
apparently they buy it [ like from goodwill ? ]
whenever i travel , i go on a hunt for great vintage shops .
i estimate that at least _num_ holes were under some kind of repair .
after finishing the round , i understand why no one was there .
unfortunately this is the norm , not an exception .
bring your cc as the ball dispenser accepts no cash .
also , i think there prices are a bit inflated .
public please be warned this place is terrible !
this is my worst experience ever with a dealership .
overall ... fuck this place .
my question to them is what the hell do they actually inspect ?
thought checking brakes is part of the _num_ point inspection ?
how unbelievably rude .
steer clear of this place , it 's a joke .
nothing is getting solved .
sometimes the vehicles fail the dealership ... .
these guys are the typical sleazy car salesmen .
tip : check the price you agree to with the salesman before signing .
they 're in the damn auto biz .
so there you have it , folks .
this place is ridiculous .
the gambling grounds itself were also a bit lackluster .
there goes the savings .
i rarely eat beef , but when i do , i like good beef .
stay somewhere else in vegas , come to sam 's town for the buffet .
sam ; s town is just ok .
this hotel/casino is off the strip and reeks of smoke .
just who the hell do you people think that you are .
it is obvious that there are issues here .
the smell is so stinky and obvious .
slots so tight the scream in pain if they pay .
there is no free here .
no wifi no shuttle no coffee in your room .
this is a casino who is in the business of taking your money .
i believe in pointing out the positives in people and companies .
the suites are typically less quality than a normal room at any other hotel .
i have my receipt , as well as the charge on my bank card .
there is nothing worse than a liar !
id '' like , who the heck talks like that ?
rooms are rather older - needs a major renovation .
without a player 's card it is over $ _num_ .
staff is unhappy slots are very bad .
this establishment deserves no stars .
staff is unhappy slots are very bad .
one star is for the movie theater , it 's super empty !
pros : beds are comfy , big bathrooms , movie theater !
never again are we going to sams town .
this place is a no from me .
here 's the kicker ( _num_ . )
i know i will never , ever being going there again .
there is a bit of noise from the airport but not to bad .
i am sick with this establishment .
this is ridiculous .
this is ridiculous .
my mother gets a _num_ dollar comp for her birthday .
she , in my opinion , needs a a lesson in customer service .
too bad , cause the food is good .
gets the second star for the cheesy spanish language videos .
this place sucks balls ... and not the good kind !
also , the waitresses are quite surly .
service is eh & the decor is dreadful .
this is a tourist trap .
if other pizza places are open id avoid this one .
first mistake : they cook it in a pan .
this place is just awful .
do yourself a favor folks , skip this joint .
it 's a waste of calories !
i mean , c'mon , fried chicken ?
the customer service sucks the atmosphere is a run down hole in the wall .
another dude walks over asks if i have a barber yet ?
i feel bad tho .
this place tries spin that `` classic barbershop '' nonsense .
my very first impression of the business is their lack of upfront pricing .
this place is a rip off .
this company is the worst .
clearly , that is a lie .
judy , we are highly educated and responsible people .
mediocre is far better the atrocious .
are u effing kidding me ?
no stars .
if you value your property rent elsewhere .
nobody speaks a lick of english ?
nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations .
i hate when a substandard company costs me money .
the new container is terrible .
the longest lines and they charge you a fee for everything .
they mask some horrible food with cheap prices .
what makes this worse is i contacted the company with no response .
again , this is simply unacceptable .
if you have a choice please avoid this place at all costs .
no stars .
there is no kids play area .
this doctor is a complete joke .
both of those girls are plain rude .
_num_ days @ $ _num_ per day .
long waits , agents take very long , never , ever again .
also , their price list is wrong .
oh and uh the spa facilities suck too btw .
he is bomb !
( which are in no way gold plated ) annoying .
they say , we automatically charge a _num_ % gratuity .
it almost feels like the sink area at your local gym .
you know , kind of stale and industrial feeling .
ok what is that ?
it 's generally an ok spa , not great .
this review is for the salon only .
i guess that one spoiled me forever .
there is also dry sauna and steam sauna .
the facilities are horrible .
that is a poor business model .
it 's small , not very clean , and not worth it .
it feels more like a gym locker room .
this place is in desperate need of repair .
there is no professionalism .
it is a huge rip off .
if you hate your job go work somewhere else asshole !
this is a horrible company .
a rating of _num_ is one too many .
unfortunately , i 'm so disappointed .
they have the most rude manager ever !
this is just awful .
the place is dirty , with _num_ lights working .
why is the garbage bin overflowing with toilet paper ?
the whole restaurants looks old and dirty .
there prices are great but their service is horrible !
vegas local and love taco bell but this one sucks so bad .

buyers beware !
all across the board its just lacking .
the appearance of the place matches the food ... cheap and unappetizing .
their food is really bland , no flavor at all !
not my favorite type of hole-in-the-wall chinese food that i like .
i live a little over a minute away .
some other reviews said that this place is inconsistent .
las vegas , nevada sales tax is : _num_ % .
she charges you _num_ % + .
the expectation is for cheap and fast pizza .
there are never any _num_ meat or supreme `` hot & ready '' pizzas .
what is wrong with you people !
now i see why u guys have so bad reviews !
this is unacceptable
their customer service is awful .
apparently there are _num_ names in play here .
the food is kind of bland .
$ _num_ `` refund '' is pathetic .
being jamaican , i 'm really disappointed .
i 've herb _num_ time , tried something different every time , not thrilled .
the food is just ok .
i mean really attitude .
well , i am so disappointed of the quality and the price .
maybe so for someone who is brain dead .
find another florist , these people are dishonest .
their prices are ridiculous , hidden fees and charges .
their stuff are rude .
they have the worst customer service ever .
turned out , the flowers are ugly .
services are worst .
their staff is extremely rude .
lots of food for the money , but quality is ick .
i 'm disappointed .
... ok ... but your window says same day .
there is never an excuse for rude service .
now it is fine after _num_ minutes of my doing it right .
i am very disappointed .
in no business is this okay .
disappointing almost every time the order is wrong .
i 'm so glad that i got a second opinion !
that 's careless work - unacceptable .
_num_ ) the groupon includes a tire rotation .
terrible , when you consider that you want a comfortable theater experience .
not that comfortable but that 's just my preference .
it 's extra ghetto inside with the worst service ever .

their menu has _num_ items ... ridiculous .
the prices are crazy we pay $ _num_ for a really bad dinner !
worst experience i 've had with lunch .
parking is terrible .
service is even worse .

just a really bad choice if you eat here.
this restaurant has bad service , bad food and the restaurant smelled bad too .
almost four hours for a meal is insane .
chicken is cheap .
kung fu thai - you suck !
the service is very slow .
i give it _num_ stars for no flavor .
he was indifferent and kind of ignored is the rest of the night .
the sweet and sour sauce is orange not pink or red and tasted terrible .
how is this poor disgrace of customer service the only one at this restaurant ?
not sure how long refund take . ''
i repeated my explanation ... i 'm in for the night .
now , beans and rice are pretty standard fare in a burrito .
menu is basic mexican food .
others who ordered with me said fish tacos are great , quesadillas were basic .
chicken tacos are gross .
only reason they got two stars is because they were fast .
the food , however is sub standard .
we support the establishment by spending our hard earned money .
i get the feeling she really hates her job .
it 's monday night football , place is pretty empty .
my guinness is ice cold and the ketchup is some generic brand .
also , i believe the manager was there as well .
this place sucks !
after waiting for _num_ mins ( yes that 's right , _num_ mins ! )
so yes one bite !
this review is for the tuesday night trivia experience .
with so many honest mechanics out there why use a dishonest one ?
first off gone are the horseradish / cranberry flavored vodka shots .
the sign on the door clearly says walk in 's welcome .
you never know until you try .
they run this business with garbage food with lame ass setting inside .
this place needs some management , nothing special about this place .
food is ok fish ceviche not good .
this place is horrible .
if you like it slow and stinky this is the place .
unfortunately , that 's why they are where they are .
house wine is less than expectations .
overall experience is disappointed .
so very rude .
i 'm mad we wasted our evening here .
no wondering that place is empty .
last few weeks pizza hut has a carryout deal called the hut lovers deal .
i am so disappointed .

i 'm sorry .
complete fail !
last _num_ visits to different locations very poor results .
the left second chair , a old lady , she is just terrible .
potstickers are pretty gross .
these people are a disgrace .
not worth the mess for the prices they have .
very disappointed in this place because i honestly do like the food !
workers are ok not super friendly but not nasty just ok .
everyone in this store is clueless !
why i 'm here for !
it 's hot as hell in here !
not a good policy when their own website is what i was price matching .
the store manager at this location is the absolute worst !
this location needs a total facelift - it 's old and dirty .
gas prices are a little cheaper here .
skip this if you have the chance .
no public restroom unless you are an employee .
it is mediocre at best .
it 's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat .
unfortunately , there are no real vegan options .
yes , i 'm mexican so let me say that the food is mediocre .
only ate _num_ shrimp that 's how bad it was .
they arrived on a cold plate , not sizzling like they normally do .
i 'm mexican this food is nasty stay away !
too bad that 's the only good thing about it .
she 's a gem stuck in that hole .
normally you get a huge plate full , not this time .
it 's only hair , right ?
i say okay , no problem .
well that 's no good .
guess it is back to looking for another pizza place near me .
so yeah , you deserve less than _num_ star .
these women have no idea what a massage is .
i am very disappointed !
why bother ?
the architecture is really odd , too .
they sadly said chang 's was as good as it gets .
still , the dim sum here is pretty cheap though .
this place is expensive and not even good .
so now why _num_ stars ?
unless you dont mind screaming across the table .
they include tips , barely _num_ % i think .
no hot girls pushing around the cart what kind of place is this ?
this place is a below average dim sum place .
the dim sum is just average at best .
i am chinese so i know dim sum !
we never get forks , who the hell uses forks ?
lot 's of _num_ stars , that 's weird .
the manager , david is a sneaky , slimy piece of work .
unfortunately , they have dim sum some time not all the time .
cold dim sum makes for a bad experience .
the reason why i give it two stars is for the horrible service .
it looks like any other dim sum place !
it is mediocre at best .
it 's bland .
the waiting time is worst !
this is horrible .
also , the only dish we have sucks .
it 's so bad .
is this food for _num_ year olds ?
maybe its a cultural thing , i dont know .
nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic .
why , the place is empty !
they play only one song over and over and over .
they only do this because this is their busiest stop .
with a competitor coupon , they still charge $ _num_ at the lowest .
now i know why ... service is pathetic .
mind you the rigatoni supposedly comes with a _num_ cheese blend .
this branch is awful .
this branch is awful .
this pizza is a joke , its not pizza by any standard .
there is no flavor to the cheese they use .
the service is really bad .
you be the judge ; however , if you expect consistency go elsewhere .
this place is awful , in particular the service from the get go .
no apology for making us wait .
this place sucks .
the staff is completely cold & rude .
i am sorry but this restaurant sucks .
this is a place who has entrees in the _num_ dollar area so ... .
is vegas really this bad ?
the only thing good is the bread with oil and vinegar .
at this point , i realized that our relationship is over .
they treat non regulars like crap !
customer service is less than _num_ star .
i hate when restaurants rush the service .
the fruit flies in the bar area are a definite problem .
service is pretentious and slow .
customer service is terrible .
i am very disappointed !
as hilarious as it sounds olive garden has better food ?
problem is , the drinks never came .
that 's unacceptable .
usually yelp is dependable .
i feel as though i wasted a meal in vegas .
the results are a permanent mistake .
its now summer and it just hurts too much with the sun .
prices are low .
you guys are really not good at lying !
how rude you are .
i wish there were multiple options with gas because this company is incredibly frustrating .
they make your payment choices so difficult .
the only thing it says online is payment processed , not returned .
you block me from paying my bill .
shame on you southwest gas .
this is unacceptable .
hire more technicians because that is very unprofessional !
this is ridiculous !
wow , i have no idea why this is still in business !
next , their information on yelp is outdated .
especially , this is las vegas !
it is ridiculously cold .
there 's a reason all of the `` real '' reviews are _num_ star .
this company sucks .
u guys r horrible !
southwest gas customer service is horrible !
they are so money hungry like every other company in las vegas nevada .
finally , we have cornbread .
if you are from new york , philly , boston .
it screams outdated , lack of standards , and absolutely disgusting food .
he also has the same complaint about the tomato sauce : bland .
i make better chicken parm at home .
if you want some more garlic bread , it 's $ _num_ per basket .
the works dish was somewhat better .
all together it was rather nasty .
this place is really bad .
an italian restaurant that serves pasta swimming in water ?
then you charge for bread now !
then when packing up leftovers they jam everything into a little box .
what was once my go to , is no more .
we order cheese sticks , spinach salad and _num_ entrees .
it seems like this is now under new ownership .
it is all hype .
the restaurant itself is a little outdated .
20-30 minute wait for a table so we opt for the bar .
so the reason for the low score is the extremely rude hostess .
however justin the busboy is a _num_ star employee .
prices are reasonable though .
the atmosphere is as lackluster as the servers and food .
the food is great the service is horrible !
i 'm italian and super disappointed in the service here .
the bartender is super rude .
she has a bad attitude !
this is a review of the gold coast 's coffee shop steak special .
this is the $ _num_ _num_ oz .
the casino and restaurants are ok .
the one thing about this place is that the room rates are always cheap .
the front desk service is horrible .
good place if you like an older crowd ( _num_ and up ) .
this place just sucks .
this place sucks so bad !
staff seems unfriendly .
buffet here is terrible on friday night seafood buffet !
anybody who eats here , avoid the buffet .
air quality in building is poor .
i 'm only giving this hotel _num_ starts bc their service was outstanding !
they really deserve one .
the whole place feels old school .
if you bet maximum slots never pay .
they actually taste downright awful !
that is false advertising !
i hate this hotel .
when i get to the room it was a _num_ bed .
this _num_ star is too much for them .
hotel rooms smell like weed .
the problem is bug bites .
vegas is over priced and overrated .
never have i dealt w anything like this is my _num_ yrs of gambling .
the gold coast hotel in vegas is horrific .
i 'm so disappointed because this place is right down the street from me .
ok , it 's the holidays , the economy sucks , blah blah blah .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
this place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant .
this operation as a whole is either severely understaffed or simply inefficient .
they are awful .
there process is harsh on fabrics .
the employees are rude , unfriendly , and straight dirty !
no one reads reviews for walmart .
some of their policy 's are ridiculous .
bottom line : walmart is lame !
i am exhausted , i am worked to the bone !
day & night , this walmart is probably the worst in las vegas !
i hate walmart .
ugh its just wrong which ever way you look at it .
first of all , the service in this store is terrible .
the only redeeming quality is the fact that this store is two blocks away .
only _num_ lines open .
this is crazy and rude customers .
just horribly run .
customer service is terrible .
she says `` no '' in an annoyed voice .
the worst thing about this walmart is their bathrooms !
there is just no excuse .
this place is such a mess .
the workers of walmart are so unprofessional .
this is the one of the worst walmart location in las vegas .
sitting here at mcdonald 's wondering how these stores even keep their doors open .
makes no sense .
their service is unbelievable .
this walmart is the worst .
this is why i like sams club they have better customer service .
seems like a low class walmart .
this is one reason i no longer carry cash .
gravy is the only solution .
the hash browns are also a bit soggy .
there are better diners in this city .
by such system this place is barely better than mcdonald 's .
where this place fell flat for me , is the food .
the burger has no seasoning .
_num_ star is _num_ too many !
keep in mind , i 'm young & my boyfriend is young .
they have your traditional american breakfast , lunch , and dinner items .
so , this is a yelp find led wrong .
they have hundreds of reviews and _num_ stars ... not sure why .
you see hundreds of bears everywhere ( weird ) .
this place is quantity over quality .
so you have a good cook station and a bad one ?
that 's a big no no with me .
they charge $ _num_ per glass .
wonder why that is ?
this place is horrible .
the older gentleman behind the desk has no clue .
they make a bad situation even worse .
i feel very terrible that someone yelled at me on the phone .
customer service is below _num_ .
it 's our fault for coming here and giving the place a 3rd chance .
card , which by the way is a ton of money !
that 's unacceptable .
again , no wonder this location is empty all the time .
flat out wrong and disrespectful in how she speaks to tenants there .
they are soo dumb .
my youngest is _num_ months old ppl !
they are rude and very unprofessional .
that 's your own damn problem , not mine .
if you are able , stay away from renting from them .
they beat me for the _num_ cleaning fee .
she replied with `` i feed my kids before i come '' .
omg this place is a nightmare !
they r a complete joke !
there 's no steps to their service and no customer service at all .
well here it is _num_ days later no approval !
i strongly suggest that umc look at this matter .
ugh so i call ahead because i broke my neck .

let alone the fact that this is just a quick care is ridiculous .
the staff sucks .

the seating in the theaters , however , is extremely uncomfortable to me .

dining room staff is extremely slow .
this is the worst fast food place here .
it is off the strip , about a _num_ minute drive .

the property management is terrible and rude !

absolutely horrendous customer service and complete waste of day everytime i come here .
management is rude and very unprofessional .
this place sucks .

this place is very unprofessional .
first off they have horrible customer service .
just go to pole position that 's what the girl at the desk says .
horrible place never go here !
zero stars .
i look at weekly apartments completely different after that experience .
makes this budget suite look like a circus .
calling front desk is useless for this issue .
next pet peeve is the laundromat .
all alarm companies do the same thing .
pool that 's never open ?
man , this hotel is boring .
has no fun shows , fancy restaurants , and shopping malls .
why they make it too small .
also , location sucks .
there are people waiting but no shuttle .
there is no line .
lots of people get off .
this was my fourth ( and last ) stay at the rio .
i guess i 'm just not a girl that likes leftovers .
i think this is the only hotel in las vegas with tube televisions .
we charge by ounce '' how cheap are you rio ?
this and the former italian place both remain empty .
the shops are crappy .
even by vegas standards , this place takes cheesy to a new level .
-the gym costs money !
the customer service sucks at the rio .
raw sewage smell in the casino near all the shops .
they have monthly free poolside concerts , yay .
they have no consideration for the disabled , boo .
no , i 'm on vacation you run the freakin ' show .
that 's stupid .
the bad news : the walls are paper thin !
the smoke in the casino is horrible .
gee , i wonder how ethical that is .
we all know that by `` suite '' the rio really means big room .
maybe my expectations of the rio are outdated , just like their room decor .
so why only _num_ stars ?
yep , $ _num_ hold !
old , dingy , smells like cigarettes .
hate this hotel .
it is expensive because , hey , it 's vegas .
this place is dirty and old inside .
the parking structure is no where near the casino .
they charge for everything and i mean everything .
they give you two queen size beds and two towels which is ridiculous .
off the strip , but the shuttle at least comes in handy .
no the rudeness from the employees sets the tone for the entire property .
desperately needs an update of the rooms and ventilation .
hallways dirty , food outside rooms kept there for days .
the rio is an overpriced waste of time and money !
they charge $ _num_ for in room coffee .
there are so many better options on the strip .
nope , if you want coffee , it costs _num_ bucks !
second , the elevators suck .
third , the rooms are totally dated and not very clean .
oh , and the slot machines suck too .
the plumbing for the two sinks need some work .
the main floor is very large but dank place .
starting with a short ( for lv ) checkin line that takes _num_ minutes .
two days later someone else gets keys to my room !
they reset my key , not theirs .
it 's regardless there is an event or not .
the rooms are all suites here , which is nice .
well , normal checkout is 11am ( ?
lumpy mattress and a bed that sinks in the middle .
as with anything in las vegas , you pay for what you get .
their machines are tight too , no such thing as a loose machine here .
early check-in is $ _num_ plus tax extra .
what you get here is a motel _num_ with a casino under it .
i see there are _num_ stars on the main page here for the rio ?
what happens in vegas is all hype !
it 's cheap .
there are many light bulbs burned out all over the place .
there are some treadmills and weights .
the problem with this hotel is the staff and the horrible customer service .
_num_ am comes ... .
a little steep i think for the quality of hotel the rio is .
watch the slot machine aisles , that 's where it 's worst .
this is unacceptable .
horrible or shall i say non existent service pool side .
the toilets flush so loud ... too loud !
$ _num_ a day for internet service in the room is an insult .
$ _num_ for a soda from the vending machine is an insult .
i was is room _num_ .
this place gets _num_ stars instead of _num_ star because of the price .
the decor needs a facelift .
dump is the _num_ letter word that best describes this place .

all our clothes smell like fried foods .
too bad , i guess that 's why it 's so cheap .

none of the water hitting you as you stand underneath the shower head .
lots of old timers and people that look like they have a gambling problem .
_num_ passes to the gym and free wi-fi for _num_ device ?
first bad thing is the location .
oh and $ _num_ per person for a cabana is insane .
this hotel is sorry excuse for a good clean time in vegas .
i am really disappointed .
this is a bad experience .
the employees rather visit with each other than take care of the guest .
the whole property needs a good pressure wash inside and out .
no wonder it 's completely dead for a saturday !
the place needs so much work .
the billing receipts is atrocious !
very unorganized and they make everything seem like it 's your fault .
it is a saturday and the casino is almost empty .
feels more like a cheap motel .
this hotel is very dated and dirty .
valet parking is a joke , took over _num_ min a few times .
stores within the casino are very expensive .
it is so far off the strip it is very inconvenient .

rooms are nice .
which is no big deal .
he has no personality and no word of honor .
the room itself is a total disgrace !
no one know anything .
first off the rooms need some major updating and better maintenance .

this place is gross .
it 's too bad .
rooms are old and outdated , definitely not kid friendly .
air conditioning is horrible , furnishings are from the _num_ 's .
the alcohol in the gift shop is ridiculous !

rio is by far the worst !
customer service is ridiculously slow and incompetent .
customer service is terrible !
sorry rio but you guys need some major updates .
sad , no coffee pots in rooms either .
i deserve a clean shower .
vegas in general is just a big lit up trap .
that means a lot of very long lines and cranky staff members .
the entire hotel has no office chair .
the restaurants are expensive here and long lines .
i never write reviews ; however , this requires one .
you want a suite go to a more upscale place .

there is a reason that they have such a bad yelp score .
go fuck yourself bro , you 're a grown ass man selling dirt bikes .

you 're busy and lazy and understaffed .
reason _num_ : this is in an older shopping plaza .
second , the store is simply not clean .
the shelves are a mess too .
the parking lot is a mess too .
why smith 's allows this is beyond me .
the staff is so-so .

the _num_ stars is all for the shuffleboard and pool table .
the pizzeria is terrible .

this is the worst place ever .
only facility close to my house that is open _num_ hours .
that being said , the actual service here is ridiculous !
if you need a screw or a part , go to hd .
mac 'n ' cheese is super inconsistent .
mashed potatoes are usually a little more consistent .
it 's a _num_ min wait for a chicken breast .

i hate this gym .
the ladies locker room is atrocious .
it literally smells like dirt and not occasionally .
so a gym is a gym .
the `` restroom '' it 's so filthy and nasty .
everytime i used their bathroom there 's so many crap around .
but occasionally i think , let me give it another shot .
i say meh because there 's nothing that great about this gym .
it gets really hot down there , especially during the summer .
this place sucks at maintenance .
oh , and it 's cheap .
during the gym rush hours , there is a major lack of weights available .
however , i cant speak for anyone else at the gym .
poor management skills .
their steam room needs a serious remodel .
of course other _num_ hours are much better than this one .

epic nom nom fail !
i regret the day that i contacted this company .
this business is terrible .
ill give them the benefit of the doubt , again .
they lie through their teeth as well .
the building is also a huge health hazard with the waiting room .
it 's a three bay garage and the smog check station .
it 's not surprising , since it 's vegas .
sushi is overpriced and not enough portions .
the oyster place in the same hotel is a better choice .
also , there is a serious stray cat problem .
they protect their friends living here not the rest !

where is my chicken and potato or chicken and string beans ?
closest panda express to my house ( unfortunately ) .

this is the worst place ever .
what is wrong with this place ?
now _num_ hrs later , i am still here !
if this is the standard of customer service i question their automotive work .
banquet room is _num_ stars .
for a sit down filipino restaurant i expect better .
does anyone know of any places ?
first off , the waitress are rude .
second , their food is way too expensive for a poor quality .
so dry that we didnt touch it .
i give them _num_ stars for the egg .
however , as far as first impressions go , this place is just so-so .
something is seriously wrong with this place .
this place is so gross .
the price point is wrong too .
when the check comes , it 's _num_ % gratuity added automatically .
what 's a nightmare .
trust me , i just know .
this place feels like a cheap buffet , loud and crowded .
- nigiri is way better than todai .
you 're better off getting a fish sandwich at a fast food restaurant .
this place is like many of your chinese buffet in every town .
however , this place is more expensive and japanese version .
meh , there are so many better japanese buffets out there .
this place sucks .
is this some kind of odd mexican fusion restaurant now ?
ok , so this place is no longer a sushi place .
why is the entire dessert section either soggy and still partially frozen ?
las vegas has many ayce sushi places .
most are around $ _num_ .
the non sushi items were all pretty bad .
over price for food that is very subpar .
why are there so many cooked tuna sushi rolls ?
they are really gross .
first off it 's $ _num_ for a pretzel and a drink .
if you want any kind of sauce it 's another $ _num_ .
totally lame !
this shuttle is the worst .
has no one heard of customer service ?
i wish i grabbed this young kid 's name working tonight .
customer beware , this is a horrible outfit .
i am very disappointed .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
though they are mostly friendly , this is just silly .
place is sad .
this is a horrible run business .
zero stars .
the only issue i have is the toilets or plumbing on the house .
i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy .
it 's 11pm , myself and _num_ other guys walk in .
$ _num_ for the smaller burger , fries , and a soda is outrageous .
my recommendation is that nobody else bother him either .
these guys have no clue what customer service is .
they add $ _num_ automatically when you use a credit card .
that 's horrible service .
there is no zen at this buddha dump .
ah well , it happens .
when i say horrible , i mean just embarrassing .
alize is the biggest disappointment in las vegas .
the only thing this place has going for it is the view .
this is the review of the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
it 's like pouring chocolate over chocolate - it 's a little too much .
this review is for the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
half the dessert menu requires that you order it _num_ minutes prior .
the flavors are overly complex , overly sweet and unimpressive .
drinks are expensive like every where else in vegas .
they are dishonest and the ownership is extremely rude .
prices are terrible !
ok , i guess it 's self service .
this is just unbelievable .
this is garbage .
sad that they keep change server and change chef .
service is tremendously slow .
there are only _num_ customers in the whole place !
this is why people get sick .
there are so many better options close by for ayce sushi .
there is a reason why they are never that busy .
if you love sushi then you know it is not cheap .
makes no sense .
the last 1/2 star is for the deep fried oreo .
they charge _num_ % for parties of _num_ or more , dinner is _num_ .
so suggesting you do a togo order instead of sitting .
that means i also know what bad to excellent service is .
customer service deserves negative stars .
_num_ calls over a week and i still dont have the right product .
this lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing .
price : locally they are very reasonably priced .
the place has a very unpleasant feel to it maybe because of the location .
as much as i come to this denny 's , i hate this location .
worst denny 's ever !
worst denny 's ever !
this place is horrible .
stinks .
waitresses all look like they rolled out of bed and unhappy .
i 'm just so disappointed with their customer care attitude .
unfortunately there is little choice in the desert , which i also hate .
wait time on their customer service hot line is outrageously long .
_num_ minute wait is unacceptable .
she 's hard at hearing .
only two locations remain they are in new mexico and washington .
i hate this place .
i now understand why they have only _num_ stars out of _num_ reviews .
now the crust is soggy .
which makes sense of all the trash !
the office staff is rude and lazy .
my surgeon gets _num_ stars .
the office staff is so rude and lazy .
make sure you triple check your home before you purchase your home through them .
the wait time while in the office is unacceptable .
the wait is almost always a minimum of _num_ hours .
parking is at least easy and admission is free .
secondly this place sucks .
the employees are ok but the manager is incompetent .
the place is ridiculously dirty .
i have a sleep numbers bed .
guess that 's partially my fault .
i think that 's so ridiculous .
this store sucks .
ed and jessica are the worst .
no management skills .
the quality of furniture is very low end .
this particular location is weird .
its not that it is a dive .
the disgusting food and poor service bothers me .
guy fieri needs a slap in the face !
bad service equals no tip !
my first hand experience is as follows .
weird thought , tastes yuck .
this place is mediocre at it 's very best .
oh ... there they are ... sitting in the window .
at least we got them , i guess ?
then there 's the smell .
it is disgusting .
pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place .
the wait staff and bartenders are rude .
the cajun fries are just fries tossed in buffalo sauce .
atmosphere is a _num_ .
bartender is less than zero .
the food is crap at best and inconsistent all the time .
if you see this review , never eat at this horrible place .
$ _num_ menu states comes with your choice of potatoes and veggies .
i 've had several items , all were average .
next month you pay $ _num_ for water and $ _num_ for lights !
_num_ of them _num_ star , _num_ of them _num_ star .
the place looks like its abandoned .
sadly , they sell an overpriced product .
i only went because everyone says they have awesome apple fritters .
the dining room is just awful .
ok , so this location is like the size of my living room .
i work at the mall also , so i know customer service is priority .
`` cough drops ? ''
she is unhelpful rude and a bitch .
as for the rest of the store , it 's only ok .
no wonder this place is such a **** hole .
so a week later again they call me your car ready come get it .
so a week later i get call from them it 's ready .
`` we finance anyone '' is a bunch of crap .
first off : i hate car buying .
i guess i was wrong .
mother of god this establishment is king of spam .
red lobster at decatur and us _num_ .
each time is same star .
she brings back our cesar salads which are bland and tasteless at best .
but no worries i am here for the shrimp .
as a former server , there 's no excuse for that .
this place is only good if you have that seafood craving .
other than that is just not worth the money and sometimes the wait .
bad service , over priced and quality of the food is bad .
holy cow this place is gross !
not acceptable , i am very , very , very disappointed .
hubby steps in and says it 's the brakes .

the restrooms are fairly gross .
the clientele is very ghetto .
i 'm pretty sure all of the stores have locations elsewhere in vegas anyways .

the mushrooms are gross - straight from the can .
this is no big deal .

there 's so many things wrong with this place .
the property is dated .
housekeeping folks ( most ) walk right by you without even a glance .
gambling is about # _num_ on the list of vegas money makers .
however service sucks _num_ stars .
i 'm very disappointed with this place .
the villa is dated .
they want _num_ minutes of your time and $ _num_ deposit .
there is no actual street access .
i have a same experience like judy in this review .
at least in a motel you get a real bed .
the final straw for me is the difficulty in booking a room .
the rooms are fine ; very small and the bed is a murphy bed .
they 're borderline disrespectful on this .
polo towers never again !
parking sucks so bad !
the location of the hotel is bad too .
the place looks old and tired .
this place is for midwest tourists on a budget !
the place needs a desperate new coat of paint on the outside .
go to that one unless you like excessive waiting .
it 's awful awful awful .
however , the fact that i no longer accept free rooms here says something .
the shower wall has a huge ball of long hair stuck to it .
sure , it 's cheap .
the tv had less channels than the free cable i get at home .
so i am like the old grandma playing slot machines .
normally the fee is $ _num_ per day .
that is ridiculous .
you 're better off paying a little more for a better buffet .
also the bathrooms have no tubs , just standing showers .
the smell of the lobby is pretty bad .
it smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels .
there 's no safety bolt on the door .
this place is pretty old , worn and nasty .
the casino , rooms , and restaurants are yuck .
the casino downstairs is okay , but not that great .
this place really sucks .
the hotel is very old and smelly .
con : it 's excalibur at _num_ - falling apart .
torn wallpaper and mold are your most common decor .
inexpensive stay , expect inexpensive quality .
, and the decor is generic and worn .
sadly excalibur is no exception .
the elevators are super slow .
that is actually false , apart from the eating with your hands part .
the hotel bar is a dick 's last resort .
yes , it 's that bad .
the jello shots contain zero alcohol .
oh , and the staff hate the guests .
the tram runs directly from here to mandalay bay , the conference casino .
ok , here goes nothing ... .
god only knows what kind of fluids left those stains !
it 's cheap .
if you 've got kids , it 's probably ok .
zero stars .
it is what it is , especially for $ _num_ a night .
needs a remodel in a bad way .
the door locks need serious maintenance .
cheap and decent , but your towers are too far away from each other .
anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the excalibur .
the customer service is horrific , especially for a vegas hotel .
there is no tub , it 's just a stand up shower .
every casino looks the same to me : slot machines and card tables .
this hotel has terrible customer service .
based upon our experience , excalibur is hardly of high caliber .
this place sucks and the rooms stink .
avoid at all costs unless you are drunk .
just expect hard beds , outdated decor and slim options for dining .
the casino is large though .
besides the low price , there 's nothing really special about the hotel .
unless you have kids , no .
they have _num_ people at every entrance !
actually it is extremely depressing .
- it feels dirty .
the place is nothing special .
the casino is in a bad location , so far from the central strip .
all of the food in this casino is bad .
if you go , ask for a recently renovated room if there is one .
the casino seems dark , smokey , and old .
the arcade is awful .
no wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm !
first off , their ventilation system sucks ass .
to me , that 's unacceptable , regardless of how cheap the rooms are .
unfortunately that is where the good ends .
at this price point , the luxor is a much better deal .
the spa only gets one star from me .
not classy , even if you are a cheaper hotel .
_num_ ) where is the wifi ?
also has some lower priced dining options .
the room service is only until _num_ p.m .
also , there are no coffee pots in the rooms !
you 're probably better off getting a microwave dinner .
it is just not worth it .
the excalibur has a major con : it is way too smokey .
this place is way over rated .
why do they even put people in such conditions ?
there has to better choices off the strip .
it smells like smoke .
nobody cares about you , they just see you as `` tip money '' .
that 's just dirt cheap for vegas .
there are many games including _num_ cent video poker ( my fav ) .
there is also convenient tram service to and from luxor and mandalay bay .
its dirty , and smelly the moment you walk in .
she 's rude as hell .
the clothing closet has no doors on it .
however , the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing .
only go to the buffet if you like macaroni salad and little night life .
ok hotel if you like empty promises .
it 's a total shame that the hotel does this .
as far as casino hotels in vegas go , this is one of them .
a restaurant changes , they change the sign .
it 's so annoying .
the good thing about their buffet is u serve ur own drinks .
oh & the resort fee is a rip off .
i mean , you get what you pay for , i know .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
the excalibur is the worst hotel on the strip .
they have horrible cell phone reception .
the customer service is bad .
they are very rude .
krispy kreme upstairs makes it less painful .
unfortunately the place is a dump .
it stinks .
the buffet is horrible .
when you come in smells like some one die in it !
her response of `` we never change the blankets '' was less than comforting .
horrible customer service and cleanliness , i guess you get what you pay for .
poor delivery and preparation for this event definitely gives this place _num_ star .
ok , i am of two minds on this place .
this place is terrible .
the view is terrible .
this place is a nightmare .
that typically goes for $ _num_ a night .
we always pull the dry clean only comforter off the bed first thing .
sucks , but it is what is .
i get that .
this is like a grown up disney world .
next time i visit vegas .
the front desk staff literally has no business being in customer service .
also , the timeshare people are pushy and annoying .
the pool has no shade unless you pay for it .
they said that area is full is so ridiculous .
the rooms here are dingy and outdated .
it is nowhere worth $ _num_ .
the bathrooms are gross .
the towels are cheap and stiff .
* check in area is old looking and long lines .
* there are no good restaurants in this hotel .
i think this was one of the reasons we got sick .
what a sad , tired , shit hole this place is .
this _num_ year old property still has no wi-fi .
the low ceiling and poor lighting are kind of depressing .
their staff is incompetent .
housekeeping is so loud .
smells terrible .
sadly , excalibur scores _num_ for _num_ on this measure .
the place is just straight up trashy .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
many of the more popular games are $ _num_ or $ _num_ per person .
the slot manager gets props for having some newer games , however .
there are plenty of options for grabbing a quick bite .
so hopefully you find your things before you return home .
the arcade 's hours are the worst .
though check in is a mile long , the casino floor is surprisingly empty .
check in didnt take long , dude was ok .
it 's pretty bad when the circus circus does a better job .
the casino is flat out dirty .
( it 's kind of like popcorn , smoke , and pee ) .
besides that , this place sucks .
the casino is old , dark , dingy and not very lucky !
_num_ ) room is ok .
but i guess you get what you pay for .
rooms are totally outdated .
reception desk people are less than friendly .
everything looks dirty except the chapel , again the only highlight .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
the games are quite boring and not many selection .
your clothes smell like it after _num_ mins in the hotel .
the only area that has wifi is the conference rooms .
this hotel is horrible .
it gets very very old after a while .
they are aggressive and very rude .
the pool and spa closes at 6pm .
there is no wireless internet in the hotel .
resort fee is ridiculous ( $ _num_ ) , you get nothing for it .
not sure how tower ii is .
staying here because my friends are ... no !
i normally stay elsewhere .
the problem is everything else .
i know , for $ _num_ .
excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square .
there 's just one thing going for excalibur - it 's cheap .
this place is nasty .
those people probably live in a barn .
there are no good restaurants here .
there is no wifi !
circus circus seems cleaner .
rooms need a little tlc though .
when i travel for work , i travel cheap .
on top of that they charge hotel resort fee .
there is no wifi .
it is basically a money trap .
i give this _num_ star just for the outside .
this very smoky hotel seems old and outdated .
the doors for the rooms are around an inch off the floor .
excalibur hotel is a giant , cheap motel .
what kinda cheap spit is that ?
the bathrooms are also only okay .
this place is cheap .
the rooms are all old but for the price i guess you cant complain .
what the hell is that .
this place smells like shit and cigarettes !
there are two hotel towers .
the security guy said someone opened our door _num_ times use the key card !
the resort fee is a joke .
there is really nothing for them .
the room is very basic .
the staff and dealers are rude .
it is extremely outdated .
this place reminds me of a motel _num_ in a castle form .
there are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom .
this place is the worst hotel in vegas .
the stole my mother in laws purse and my daughters purse .
on top of that the staff is horrible .
that is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .
i am a vegas veteran been there four times this year alone .
the decor is old and ugly in the hallways and the rooms .
no wifi in the room is awful .
the resort fee is a total scam .
secondly , the parking is awful .
it is absolutely awful , it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must .
this hotel also has the worst dining on the strip .
this place is essentially the motel _num_ of the strip .
my issue is bed bugs .
this is just dirty .
the beds are hard and very uncomfortable .
the room is very dated .
there is no safe and small fridge .
the pillows are nasty .
the most musty stale smell ever !
this hotel seriously needs an upgrade tho ... .
something like $ _num_ , so u think .
this place is a disgrace .
customer service at this hotel is absolutely horrible .
they actually laugh at you when you lose money .
i mean , really ?
this is a sorry excuse for a hotel .
nothing like spending your new years eve in a room infested with bed bugs !
the rooms are outdated and if you want an updated room it cost extra .
finally we find parking .
also , the parking is atrocious .
this is no man cave it 's a boy cave .
they are rude .
this hotel is cheap , so it brings in lower end customers .
this hotel is no place for a good family .
this place is a disgusting joke .
the beds are old and very uncomfortable .
the staff is beyond surly and rude .
their signature restaurants are buca de beppo and dick 's last resort .
hmmm maybe excalibur is this way on purpose .
this is absolutely ridiculous !
not only that , they have horrible customer service !
not a good vibe , kinda prison feel .
this place is shabby , thoroughly unimpressed .
cons : front desk staff hate their job .
the toilet runs all night .
they are the worst here !
this is a budget friendly hotel .
the one major perk of the excalibur is the location .
nasty game they play .
this is the 1st & last excalibur experience for us .
are they just making the beds and not changing the sheets ?
other receptionists call us down over to them .
rooms are awful .
otherwise go elsewhere because this hotel sucks !
the furniture and look of the rooms are very outdated .
this is a piece of crap property .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
customer service _num_ stars .
i am very disappointed .
i guess that 's why excalibur is so cheap .
my friend and i recently went to vegas for _num_ days .
now it seems outdated .
it gets worse .
the only thing it has going for it is location .
it is the equivalent to a run down motel _num_ .
not up to my standards especially since i work in the industry .
we all know how vegas lines are !
those beds are so hard it 's like sleeping on the ground !
i 've had a better sleep in holiday inn .
this is just unacceptable .
being ugly in decor is one thing .
the lack of cleanliness is very evident in this hotel .
no excuses .
negative - wifi is awful !
food is awful .
the bed is really hard and uncomfortable .
also ... the ac units are crazy loud .
the food here is really bad .
they have the nasty sushi but no wasabi available .
the hotel lobby stinks .
that 's ridiculous and just wrong .
the walls are paper thin , this place smells like heavy smoke !
it 's all complete crap !
this hotel is very outdated .
there was no fire but that alarm is loud as all heck .
make sure you know there is $ _num_ resort fees per day !
if you want excitement , take $ _num_ and go to las vegas .
the hotel as a whole is dated .
the security is inept .
cons : no room in the entire hotel has a bathtub .
the restaurants are , at best , also mediocre and very expensive .
usually , the rates are cheaper if you stay on weekdays .
weekend stays are rather more expensive .
this place is terrible .
the hotel itself is old and not clean .
their customer service is horrible !
_num_ dollars extra .
( not sure if it 's per night ) .
there is no coffee maker !
long walk from the elevator to the room .
rooms have no mini fridge , microwave , or coffee pot which is inconvenient .
it 's so frustrating !
the casino has an old appearance , decor .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
makes no sense .
i am beyond frustrated .
no wonder it has only _num_ starts not surprised .
wtf is a hotel fee for !
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew .
the parking facilities are atrocious .
be cautious and remember you get what you pay for !
this spot is a joke .
front desk , are you asleep ?
the only upside is there are $ _num_ tables .
the hotel is old and stinks .
i think circus circus is better than this place .
good thing about it is that it is open _num_ hours .
customer service training is in order .
now i 'm at home , in pain with no meds .
this is by far the worst serves ever !
in this case , `` food '' however is a stretch .
that 's so frustrating .
so ladies , just leave the heels at home .
parking is ridiculous .
the food is mediocre at best .
also , waiting in line _num_ minutes for a cup of coffee seems excessive .
i mean seriously , this is a convention center .
food is too expensive .
for a convention center , i 've had better , much better .
these people are rude and no professional .
the bathrooms are disgusting with piss everywhere and the whole place is just filthy .
audio staff is awful .
get some better food in there , it 's _num_ not _num_ .
this is my 3rd visit .
nothing like taking the long way around when it 's _num_ outside .
love the con ... hate the venue .
for vegas , it is surprisingly dated convention center .
wait times are incredibly long .
just another example of why drugs are bad for you kids .
the quality and presentation of the food is bad .
and then tell your waitress it 's nevada state law .
i think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread .
maybe there 's a food shortage in vegas .
friendly service but the wait for the food is out of this world .
why are they so salty ?
happy hour prices are ridiculous .
till then , it 's for drinks only , if even that .
the seating areas are for customers . ''
the food alone is maybe a _num_ star .
zero stars .
zero stars .
i know places have bugs that us customers never see .
man people are idiots .
this place is really gross .
this is pretty boring .
it is hit or miss .
hmm , that 's weird .
because to me , $ _num_ is a lot of money for nothing .
on the whole , this place is just meh .
this is so beyond acceptable , i am at a loss .
also it 's $ _num_ for a bottle of water .
this place is the absolute worst .
oh god , i pity him now .
first off , who puts pink roses on a ninja turtle cake ?
that 's just bad planning right there .
waitresses are horrible !
this is a shame for an established food chain !
almost yellow in color , smells nasty and the meat is just little bit .
i am so insulted .
the service just sucks .
they never fail me !
i normally tip even for just picking up food from a restaurant but this time.
every filipino restaurant in new york gives a free order of rice per person .
next , i leave the office .
they made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience .
horrible is an understatement !
first , the place is butt ugly .
if you want great italian at a better price , go to pasta mia .
a table of _num_ , entrees all around , two bottles of wine .
first off this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift .
it 's decor is not only very dated but a bit shabby .
second the service is slow .
our bill came to $ _num_ without the _num_ % tip that we include .
looking for italian in las vegas , look elsewhere .
there are two empty tables next to us .
the whole enterprise is an embarrassment to good taste .
this is completely unacceptable .
she then drives _num_ minutes back home .
it 's in a real crappy part of town .
now it is the most bland disgusting watered down garbage ever .
the food is okay but expensive for vegas .
the real problem is the restaurant itself .
customer service is pretty much non existent , they 're rude and slow .
also their gel products are cheap .
ive been here three times and it gets worse every time .
my toes are still not dry .
they are slow , rude and overpriced .
so i wait some more .
firefly , this is my second visit .
it 's crowded , dark , and festive .
however , i think this place is over rated .
this place is soooo off and on to me .
they have _num_ locations ... this one is on eastern ave .
food quality is average at best preparation completely uneven .
_num_ stars for this location , _num_ stars for other locations .
this is terrible .
it 's such a shame because firefly has delicious tapas and drinks .
i highly doubt it .
be warned , if they open again .
fyi ... that triple shot game is a tourist trap and a scam .
sometimes rio is just too far from all the action so we stay here .
everytime someone goes to the bathroom or shower ... ... .
this is a really crappy hotel with really crappy customer service .
harrah 's is old vegas , meaning smokey and nasty .
they want your money .
the rooms are small and nothing special .
ok , seriously , dude .
as well has terrible customer service .
other than that i know why my stay was only $ _num_ a night !
never again harrahs , never !
the casino feels old and stinky .
there is a serious lack of communication at this hotel .
anyway , the rooms are the pretty standard low budget hotel rooms in vegas .
you really get what you pay for here .
this place sucks ass .
also rooms a little worn .
the tables are hit or miss and the amount of smoke is ridiculous .
nothing drops besides the bills in your wallet .
there is no sun on the pool at all .
not very big , but they do the trick .
the bed in comfy though , so that 's a plus .
just about everything here is understaffed .
it is _num_ .
harrahs has no .
motel _num_ has wifi .
the starbucks in paris has wifi .
the rooms are very outdated early _num_ 's maybe ?
dog urine stains on sofa corners shower curtain full of mold .
there just feels like there 's nothing special here .
then he goes , '' ok , i get it .
it 's ridiculous .
last , and certainly not least , they lack wifi .
this hotel has no customer services at all .
negative : this is one of the older hotels .
air quality is poor .
airport shuttle is $ _num_ per person - cash only .
higher tier rooms are of better quality .
the casino is nothing special .
the buffet is just o.k .
the best cheap hotel that i prefer is the flamingo .
the casino is outdated and lacking in the slot machine area .
me , i think harrah 's sucks .
the only good thing about this hotel is the location .
my 10th time to vegas and this is my least favorite hotel .
alot of trash walking around if ya know what i mean .
the carpet is nasty .
i mean everything from the parking garage , elevators , walls etc .
_num_ queen beds instead of one king !
_num_ ) rude .
`` new york is very expensive '' .
then when the clerk asks for my id she comments on my coach wallet .
coach is very expensive '' .
rooms are old as well as old nasty carpet .
room just looks cheap .
this place is an absolute joke .
i advise that you avoid this place at all costs .
first of all the rooms are very outdated .
no i didnt mean no wifi , i mean no internet !
aside from that not worth staying there unless they comp you a room .
stay away if you have moderate standard requirements .
the only positive is its at the center of the strip .
as most of vegas , the hotel smells like smoke .
all in all i 'm pretty disappointed with this hotel .
the only good thing about this hotel is it 's location .
circus circus is cheaper and they actually have wi-fi there !
great location on the strip , but this place is otherwise pathetic .
rooms are gross !
they give you soap for the shower but no hand soap for the bathroom .
the hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip .
the only good thing about this location is the location .
_num_ minutes at least with no clean up .
the internet is horrible .
this is just terrible and unacceptable .
between 11pm and 6am , your room service food options are ... nothing .
the smell is that of a _num_ year old ash tray .
the uniforms , brand in general is just terrible .
rooms are very old and tired .
the sports book is small and cramped , as is the poker room .
like i say , getting in and out of there now is a nightmare .
i like it cold , i usually set the thermostat at _num_ .
newer casinos have bathrooms placed better along the gaming floor .
this place is an absolute dump !
the only great thing about harrahs is the location which is central to everything .
purchased weekend stay thru expedia .
find a hotel with parking security , saves you more money in the end .
there is a tv in the restroom but no remote for it .
i never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers .
room is outdated .
this place is the complete opposite .
this place is extremely understaffed .
if not , they need a new one .
harrah 's is in serious need of a complete renovation top to bottom .
i hate they charge for wifi .
the poker room card shuffle machines hardly work .
the room itself needs some work .
that _num_ star is for hospitality .
no one said `` oh that sucks i 'm sorry . ''
for what its worse : they said car break ins happen regularly .
bye bye harrahs .
this casino is a bit tired for las vegas .
there goes _num_ star .
that 's horrible !
there goes _num_ star .
the decor is very outdated and dingy , they need a whole update !
the colors are just dreadful .

apparently it 's a `` request '' not a reservation .
here comes the biggest problem ... .
the hotel is ok nothing special but not horrible .
really , is this how you run a business ?
that 's just horrible management and customer service !
everyday i need a new room key they never work .
finally she hands me the confirmation that it sent .
the parking lot has no cameras .
the whole floor that my room is on smells like a locker room .
check in took over an hour , with only _num_ people work .
overall , harrah 's is a terrible hotel .
the mardi gras tower needs an update badly .
we rate the place less than a star !
the casino staff is more helpful than the hotel staff .
every thing else sucks .
room is outdated and not properly cleaned .
all of the poor reviews are right .
shady business practice , but that 's vegas .
i mean black and dirty on the cushions , arms and back .
there 's no mini bar or snack center in the room .
this is the worst worst place ever !
next thing we know , our door room is open .
in the mardi gras floor the rooms are extremely dated .
the food in the restaurant is extremely overpriced .
i agree with all the bad reviews , save your money !

the location is fantastic for visiting the strip .
the people at the front desk are rude and incompetent .
the employees are rude due partially to ownership changes over the last _num_ years .

there are much better options on the strip and especially off the strip .
they also charge over $ _num_ per day for a resort fee .
the smell when you walk in is overwhelming .
serious gives me an instant headache .
as far as standard bathroom amenities go , this room was totally sub-par .

the food is very mediocre .
there are so many better choices .
the staff is indifferent !

coming from los angeles , i 've had my fair share of mexican food .
_num_ star is too much for this place .
the salsa is bland & no flavor .
there is way better choices when it comes to mexican food in vegas .
it 's nothing but lemon juice , salt and beer .
this place is terrible .
but forget all that , the food is bland .
the only thing delicious here are the chips .
this place has a lot of potential for great food .
your money is much better spent in the venetian food court .
they charge _num_ dollars for chips and salsa .
any mexican place that charges for this is a joke .
i 've had better seasoning on beans from a can .
there are much better places for mexican food on the strip .
the service here is very poor and slow .
they charge for chips and salsa as an appetizer .
the tacos are neither street nor gourmet : on a par with chipotle .
the walk ways are pretty narrow which makes things worse .
i 'm glad i at least really like the wallet !
this place is the worst .
you fail hard .
this place sucks .
the mash potatoes just suck .
anything worth a damn is out of order .
just hold out until you are _num_ boys .

what 's worse than broken equipment at the gym ?
no parking lot cameras , no security .
the service here sucks .
you all have trouble even closing on a t shirt .
really , i have no problem with the company that is apple .
like _num_ hours fast .
the wait here is ridiculous !
not the store itself but the main customer service is terrible .
i swear the incompetence of the employees from apple is ridiculous .
i 'm tired of apples abysmal customer service .
this store is no exception .
it is almost _num_ years old .
circus circus is half ghetto , half trailer park and _num_ % hell .
otherwise , it 's a seriously dismal place .
it 's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts .
there 's a reason why they 're cheap .
it 's a $ _num_ cab ride to the bellagio !
they have a really disgusting buffet !
leave your kids at the theme park while you go gamble .
whats worse than the crappy room is their crappy restaurants .

this place is just all kinds of bad !
the steak place across from the buffet is delicious .

overall , this place is a roach motel for clowns .
which is supposedly their modern tower .

i just want a nap , so i get under the covers .
this place is a piece of crap .
there is a $ _num_ additional hotel fee upon check-in .
this includes pool access , the fitness room , etc .
the casino itself is pretty bad and noisy -- no high class establishment here .
unless , you write a yelp review about it .

circus circus is now a freak show .
parking garage _num_ is the the worst .

it is a sight that just reeks of old and outdated .
what 's worse is the casino is usually only at about _num_ % capacity .
it almost feels like you 're in a motel .
the place is a giant indoor carnival .
it is really a dinosaur casino compared to alot of others on the strip .
i get it ... you get what you pay for ... but really ?
this is a _num_ star review .
circus circus is on the strip but really far north .
just my opinion , folks , which is what yelp is all about .
clowns scare me .
so this place is out of control .
i think this is the most ghetto casino in existence in las vegas !
their is a stale taste in the air .
they are boring yes .

the music is just a little too cheery , a little too loud .
wow , is there a negative _num_ star ?
long , long walk to the next hotel .

only giving one star cause i think i had too .
i 'm very disappointed with our stay .
i feel like we wasted our money .
the room i 'm in smells , but not terribly .
monorail runs through the side of the building .
circus circus is a sad joke .
it 's a very filthy smelly old building .
they 're idiots .
this is the worst hotel ever .
i cant sleep .
there is a stench that has no equal .
omg ... this place is so smoky and so busy .
this place is so outdated , its unbelievable .
okay ... that 's a little outdated but sure .
as an adult those clowns just get even worse .
the casino is small and not enjoyable .
that being said , the biggest problem with this hotel is location .
shame on you circus circus !
i 'm glad all my stuff was still there .
the casino itself is small with only a few tables .
the entire hotel is just old looking and depressing in my opinion .
the manor lodge is a short sketchy walk from the main hotel .
at first glance the casino seems very dingy .
service at the front desk is unacceptable .
the entire place smells like smoke !
the workers at the midway where the games are are so cold and rude .
the rooms are terrible .
bad smells .
all the food is overpriced and complete tasteless crap .
i 'm very disappointed .
old and rundown , nothing like what i remember .
the only thing i ask for is a clean room with no bed bugs .
my son , husband and i have nothing but bed bug bites .
thanks for nothing _num_ thumbs down .
guests have no priority in anything , especially parking .
once again , thanks too valet .

the rooms in the manor behind the main resort are horrible and outdated .
they charge a $ _num_ resort fee per day .
this place is terrible .
the parking deck is so gross !
elevator is too tiny .
never choose this hotel even its price looks like lower than some others .
mgm resorts , _num_ % through with you .
this is a depressing environment as all you see is ghetto everywhere .
all of which is indoors which is a major plus for summer time .
this is ridiculous , unprofessional and by far the worst hotel on the strip .
pool closes at _num_ p.m .
if money is an issue , stay a little off the strip .
secondly there are stains everywhere in this place .
i get it is 4th of july and there 's a lot of people .
i have the worse experience staying at circus circus .
im never coming here again .
i refuse bad service from companies .
he is _num_ years old and suffering from his own health problems .

the food selection is mediocre as well as what it actually tastes like .
the service here is terrible .
it 's a pity .
wow ... for once i wish yelp had a rating lower than one star .
she gets through about _num_ people before leaving the table .
then the never ending wait begins for our main courses .
this restaurant reminds me of a stuffy , overpriced and overrated restaurants .
it 's okay , no big deal just seat us somewhere else .
this rating is for store employees and the store .
this is very unprofessional .
f you dude that 's so shady .
this is the most unprofessional establishment in las vegas .
both the sales reps and `` managers '' here are an absolute joke .
it 's a shame .
employees like him do absolutely no good for the company and their image .
shoot , even a `` hello , good afternoon '' goes a long way .
i am a _num_ year old business owner living in las vegas .
i think it 's a reliable mean of transportation here .
the cost is far too much .
it sucks .
then again , it is vegas !
oh and the bus comes once every _num_ minutes .
this is seriously the worst bargain in las vegas .
horrible people work for the las vegas monorail .
that was flawless and the reason it 's _num_ stars instead of _num_ .
there is no point .
dont take the monorail !
thats what the vegas monorail is like to me ... without being so funny .
the cost of $ _num_ per person each way is far too expensive .
the monorail in las vegas is a complete joke .
the security staff , when you actually see them , are a joke .
trust me folks , save your money and take the bus on the strip .
this is an essentially useless transportation tool .
apparently , a one mile walk is `` near '' one of the stations .
the monorail is a ripoff for tourist .
first off , they only carry hello kitty character items .
oh , i 'm sorry .
nothing and i say nothing about that food was memorable .
the only thing about this place that is memorable , the bill .
this place has terrible food !
oh and there is definately no dim sum .
the service is horrible .
there is zero flavor here .
worst dining experience on vegas strip ever !
it 's a bit dry but still edible .
horrible waiters who complain about each other in front of patrons about their tips .
prices are typical vegas for nothing special .
( _num_ ) there are laundry facilities that are always full and overpriced .
neighbors are nightmares .
if there 's one person in the gym , it 's crowded .
management does nothing about complaints .
there is so much noise at all hours .
it 's ridiculous .
it 's so bad .
an bed bugs too .
only high ratings on here are from employees .
the front office is exceptionally rude .
there is no real security .
the referring people for a discount on rent is also a lie .
probably because they have no intention of paying anyone .
the only good thing about this apartment complex is the location .
this place is garbage .
so , it 's more like _num_ stars .
the people in here are just stupid !
am i suppose to just air dry myself and go downstairs ?
there is no overall security on the facility .
the `` casino '' is a complete dump .
the pillows on the bed feel like a bag full of socks .
first of all its not a `` hotel '' , its a motel .
finally she tells me that i have no reservation .
first of all front office staff is rude and very disrespectful .
sorry guys but this to me is a no go !
casino is a small cramped area with about a dozen slots .
best part of the hotel is the outdoor pool and hot tub area .
this place is terrible .
fridge in room broken and stinks .
the sheets have holes in the them .
sheets look about _num_ yrs old .
their service is terrible and very expensive too !
there is no microwave , just a little fridge .
there are only a few channels on the tv , very limited .
on to the bad dingy towels , roaches everywhere yuck !
we get our bags head to the elevator and bam , elevator is broke .
no microwave or coffee maker , which seems standard to me .
the wifi connection is terrible .
never have i had such a horrible experience at a hotel .
if you value your safety , stay away from the mardi gras hotel .
it 's gross .
on our two queen size beds they put the smallest almost square pillows .
no wifi , that is terrible !
this is a motel , not a hotel .
well this place is no good .
it 's just all bad .
it is cheap .
every room here is smoking room so it smells really bad !

the charge for all _num_ nights is still on my card .
it is awful .
the lighting is terrible .
the wifi is terrible .
the pictures of the casino on here are very deceiving .
there 's only about _num_ slot machines in the casino area .
_num_ ) doors open into the parking lot .
the waitress in the bar cafe at night is just rude .
i for sure got numerous bed bug bites that night .
the walls are paper thin .
they are the worst !
incredibly unprofessional and i 'm extremely disappointed .
the food always has a problem .
it 's either burnt or missing or not cooked enough etc .
this pizza takes like crap !
this place needs a corporate visit because it gives dominos a bad name .
it 's a chain restaurant , meaning not truly ethnic .
moral of my story -- this place is no breeze .
there is just nothing special about it that draws me back .
there food is just not my thing i guess .
everything is god awful .
over priced and the monday night bartender ( s ) needs a bit work .
to me , that 's cold .
steer clear of this place - the service is sub-par .
_num_ $ lobster & shrimp linguine has no flavor .
this place is kinda depressing .
so they take us to the table ; there are only _num_ seats .
there is no in between .
usually it is busy .
_num_ stars for now .
same thing goes for the meals .
a few bites in , i bit into something hard .
well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing .
it 's is reasonably price but nothing special .
eh the place is alright nothing to exciting .
also , that party room on the west side is always hot .
if not , then go elsewhere .
food is great but customer service is terrible here .
this place is so lame !
i feel like she rushed through all of her clients .
customer service sucks .
maybe its because i 'm african american .
found a shop on las vegas blvd that fixed my toe for $ _num_ .
this place is ok nothing special or amazing about it .
i 'm a good customer of this store .
this is the worst customer service ever .
is strip pricing .
also her charge without insurance $ _num_ per visit she 's worth $ _num_ .
now i have a crying _num_ year old .
dude , these people are rude .
the facility is old and rundown .
not okay , especially when it is as busy as it was .
this _num_ star rating is only for the mac part of this macy 's .
i realize this was partially my fault for not watching it more carefully .
the shoe section is total crap !
how rude is that ?
if you hate your job that bad quit .
seems quite .
the cookies at this store look nothing like the cookies on the website .
food here is old , dry and bland .
that 's the selling point , it is cheap .
this place sucks ass .
he just needs some clowns .
probably the most cheapest and generic things i ever seen .
no thanks ; - ; that 's why i always get chopsticks .
they 're all incompetent and rude .
er staff is rude and uncaring .
_num_ attempts _num_ responses .
the er is a mess .
they have no consideration and no compassion .
the only convenience is that it is about _num_ minutes away from my home .
nurses are rude !
i have no problems .
omg the worst hospitals in michigan are better than this place .
one star is too high for this death trap .
this hospital is horrible .
this is the worse place ever and it 's very dirty .
that 's ridiculous !
i repeat , never go to this hospital !
i am _num_ years old .
ok , i get it .
they have zero sense of urgency .
instead , they sit around their station , talking about their personal lives .
total fail .
the hospital is older , i understand they have a lot of traffic .
the nurse 's are horrible !
the only problem is that the new price was $ _num_ .
consumer report here i come .
i hate this one .
why spend so much money in a place where they treat you like crap ?
walk in there tonight .
oh well , lv 's loss is gucci 's gain .
the prior review is dead on !
these are condo units built in the _num_ 's and individually owned .
the plates .
common areas , such as hallway carpeting are disgusting and smelly .
for italian food , there are much better choices in las vegas .
it 's bad .
there are better italian restaurants in your home town .
i 'm pretty sure the sauce was ragu .
if you go , make a reservation and be ready for crowds .
so take it from me , this place sucks .
now one of the problems with this place is -- entrees are expensive .
seriously , he is old and bent over .
the food is bad .
the wine is bad .
it 's more like hot chocolate .
in the evenings , one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it .
this food is worse than cafeteria food .
i hate you , battista .
this place is terrible .
they only ask you if you want red or white .
it 's nothing special .
even if you cant cook , look up a recipe and try it yourself .
one sign of this is that it is only open after _num_ pm daily .
( i am a _num_ year resident of las vegas . )
i am torn between _num_ and _num_ stars .
battista 's hole in the wall ... i hate this restaurant .
also , that little accordion man ... he 's sooo creepy .
any type of pasta dish is over _num_ bucks .
it 's a bottomless house wine place .
this place is so overpriced it is laughable .
it 's like stepping into old vegas .
manicotti is a long tube pasta .
_num_ is white the other a red blend .
the decor is kitschy - crap all over the place .
this place is a piece of las vegas history .
this is adequate but not at all great .
* '' cappuccino '' chocolate , hazelnut flavored coffee with whipped cream is yummy .
the place is a total tourist trap and expensive .
i 'm blonde but not stupid .
i guess pasta lovers ... just plain love pasta , no matter how crappy ?
the prices are literally insane .
there are so many better options .
food looks like mass prepared in mess hall .
it 's ok but but not wonderfully by any stretch .
never ever recommend !
then you already know what this tastes like .
this place is horrendous .
clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen .
the adult menu starts at _num_ with a high price over $ _num_ .
this is an italian restaurant for tourists on a budget .
anybody 's home made spaghetti is better than that .
it is really `` a hole in the wall `` .
hole in the wall is right .
now it is overpriced pasta .
the wine is cheap vinegar that they refill after every use .
this food is below sub par .
the only thing `` institution '' about this place is the food .
i try both red and white , they are identical .
too expensive for the quality believe the bad reviews .
the wine is bottom of the line .
the salad is served in plastic bowls .
that 's why they get the 2nd star .
it 's chicken and pasta in a white sauce .
it seriously has no taste , just a fatty consistency .
so , we order the chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs .
the better dishes are $ _num_ and up .
this is definitely a hole in wall .
the big draw here is the cheap unlimited free wine !
it has way too much sugar .
-the lighting in the restaurant is horrid .
there are many other , better choices for italian food elsewhere in vegas .
food is bland and severely lacks in taste and seasoning .
with the hundreds of restaurants in las vegas , this is a major failure .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
oh and for the food the prices suck .
the staff here has the worst customer service skills !
are you people insane ?
no flavor , and average as the day is long with restaurant style pricing .
it looks like panda express but tastes nothing compared to it .
shame on you yelp !
this place is why mcdonald 's is always an option .
nah , the place is a complete ripoff .
it 's better tasting , better quality and a better price .
the amenities on the web site are a lie .
i know mexican food damn it .
i have ( ex ) mexican in-laws .
the salad - even the dressing is better at your local sushi joint .
depending on what you get , its a free meal , so why not ?
one star is too much .
benihana at las vegas hotel & casino is the worst place ever !
the dcor is _num_ stars alone .
their so called garlic has no bit of garlic flavor what so ever .
the food itself is very poor here .
the sushi bar is terrible .
i spend $ _num_ on a mediocre meal with awful service .
it 's a shame that benihana corporation lets this sort of thing go on .
the seating is very uncomfortable .
this is sad and unfortunate .
i personally feel that their management is terrible and impersonal .
the sauces they give you ... awful .
this location is terrible .
yelp lists this location as closing at _num_ but they really close at _num_ .
the food at the buffet is just as bad .
i have very bad experience on today !
that 's no problem .
i suggest you avoid this shop and its a shame .
there are always maintenance issues either no hot water , water or ac .
the management is awful .
three stores i never buy anything from anyway .
this place is an empty shell .
that 's sad .
i also miss the pet store .
i try on shoes , i circle the store about _num_ times .
the only good place here is old navy .
secondly , there are absolutely no good food options .
the customers are less then desirable .
the food court is ridiculous .
not a good commercial location at all unless one is a chain store .
the only good store they have here is victoria secret but the service sucks !
i say skip it and put your money elsewhere .
i mean , really ?
like the way rotten fish smells that 's how it tasted .
_num_ entrees plus a bottle of wine .
this place was probably the worst disappointment of our vegas trip .
for extremely mediocre italian food , this is your choice .
btw , the server 's name is josh .
you 're a douche for all those comments and a horrible server .
the service ; however , is horrible !
you tell me if that 's rude and unprofessional !
not the first time and only because it 's a party .
how does an italian place mess up pasta ?
mama mia , that 's a shitty restaurant !
summary : _num_ hours later , _num_ unsatisfied customers , _num_ cases of diarrhea .
for the price , i expect way better service .
of course at these prices middle of the road is unacceptable .
sorry but i rather eat at olive garden .
there 's plenty of italian restaurants in venetian so avoid this one .
she is rude .
pizza is awful !
margherita & veggie pizza are terrible .
the crowd is jean shorts & t-shirts .
this is by far the worst salon ever !
they over charge for horrible work .
it looks worse !
also i want my money back .
the pool is too small .
so here is the good the bad and the ugly !
it looks like around _num_ square feet .
there is no room service here .
there is no restaurant .
the front desk and concierge have zero customer service skills , imho .
as mentioned , there is a deli on site .
they are so money hungry it 's just unbelievable .
the hotel itself is just regular , sometimes even worst .
so , that 's about $ _num_ just for the deposit for the room .
no wonder the place is so dead all the time .
it 's sad and depressing .
this place sucks .
that 's how bad this place is .
okay that explains the _num_ week turnaround time .
people complaining of roaches is nasty as hell too !
dillard 's is utterly disgusting and trashy .
the employees are unhelpful and not trained for their department .
even worse they pressure you into getting the in store charge card .
my size is _num_ .
that 's kind of ridiculous .
now i know they exchange to me it 's no brand new !
cause i never wear that shoes !
i 'm so angry !
i 've had a couple of very bad experiences with them .
for some reason it feels snobby in the wynn .
i am extremely disappointed .
it 's no big deal .
okay ... it 's more like _num_ 1/2 stars .
so , about two weeks pass , when i receive an e-mail from hotwire .
are nothing special either .
the show plays every _num_ minutes starting when the sun is down .
the next day , wynn still has no double rooms .
the customer service is horrible .
the room has _num_ full sized beds .
the slot machines are money hungry man eaters .
the wynn sucks .
the staff was so useless and at times even rude .
the food sucks .
the food sucks .
especially at the prices they charge here .
this is a review of my gambling experience .
the expensive buffet says a lot too .
that is totally a bs rule .
common areas _num_ stars .
shops _num_ stars .
if you visit , stay out of trouble kids !
you suck .
unhelpful , disrespectful , you get the point .
i usually stay in vegas a min of twice a year .
the spa is terrible as is everything else .
i hate everything about the wynn .
while the facility was lovely , this behavior is unacceptable .
that is about as bad as it gets .
a $ _num_ rental fee for a refrigerator is ridiculous .
i thought that was rude as i know it didnt work .
- drinks are outrageously expensive ( $ _num_ for a shot of bourbon ! )
in this day and age they charge $ _num_ ?
they have the worst valet parking service ever !
service is awful .
the staff is beyond rude .
second , the place stinks .
worse stay ever in vegas !
the seating is weird .
there 's a long bench with three small tables on the other side .
yes i know _num_ days in vegas ?
* while at our lily pad at encore beach club flip flops stolen .
it 's a long walk from the garage to registration .
there are no shortage of luxury hotels on the las vegas strip .
they get an f here .
first off i feel very weird here .
`` the cafe '' is really the opposite .
this casino takes ur money within _num_ min .
hear is where it gets worse .
why bother when no one is in your store .
my rating is for the customer service not the hotel .
shrimp and grits bland an boring , porterhouse over cooked and not tasty .
if you dont know you are out of luck .
the only casino in vegas that does this .
craps only allow 2x odds now .
mr. steve wynn , please address this issue asap .
this is when reputation management goes wrong folks .
a little pricey but you get what you paid for .
however that is where i great the problem .
the red card station attendants are the exact same way .
the room service food is awful i 've had better at luxor .
she just said it 's a request and not a guarantee .
non-smoking is also a request and not a guarantee .
the manger on duty has the same bad attitude .
service is bad .
services is worse than a motel .
it 's now past the check in time and still nothing from the wynn .
the service is so bad !
rude , obnoxious and shady people manage this place .
five stars hotel become no star !
this is my last trip here until there is a smoke free casino .
$ _num_ a person is fraud for the poor variety and selection .
sleep on the carpet , what other solution is there ?
* shops are very pushy for a close .
* wife likes the slot machines at this casino , thus we stayed here .
food is over priced , drinks are over priced .
which is very unfortunate because again , we are on our honeymoon .
which is a shame because it really is a beautiful place .
this is where it gets interesting ; and utterly unacceptable .
housekeeping standards are far below to any steve wynn property .
apparently it 's no longer in fashion in this hotel .
even in the toilet i get id .
people who check you in are not friendly , at all .
this resort is a total zero .
the room service is so so , bacon in particular is a little lackluster .
both encore which i stayed at and wynn are horrible .
what is wrong with these people .
even the downtown casinos have better odds .
so ... how does a first class establishment ... sink to such a low ?
then again , so does the sahara .
the main reason for the ugh is the parking situation here .
the place has long , dim , dark hallways leading to meeting rooms .
really needs improving ... .
the count `` hell '' the douche bag is a more fitting description .
parking for the showroom is atrocious if busy .
the merchandise for sale is way overpriced .
so , the _num_ stars i gave this place is solely for the food .
yes i know it is las vegas .
this place is gross .
sample your food before you buy it people .
it was cheap we had a buy one get one coupon .
makes hometown buffet taste like a gourmet _num_ star meal !
nasty , stinky & has lots of shit on the floor , literally .
food is bomb tho .
service is bad .
the name says it all : this place is pretty terrible .
this place sucks for non smokers !
avoid the buffet if you expect a decent selection .
omg this place is so bad !
it 's almost offensive that this is how they reward their loyal guests !
other than that , this is a so so restaurant .
maybe it gets better at night who knows ?
anyways , i believe i had their mac and cheese and buffalo wings ?
that is restaurant _num_ .
well i guess it 's crappy service from a crappy apartment .
the tv 's are terrible .
so , at this point i 'm in tears .
this is why i buy everything online .
the worst saks ever .
all the employees there dress terribly .
lastly , it has no class at all .
_num_ days later it was complete ( no biggie , stuff happens ) .
the dj 's are always rude .
yes - they have that old style vegas feel ... .
if you like a security service that is totally useless ... .
at most they deserve at _num_ .
the wait staff are nice though ... _num_ stars for the friendly waitress .
the bar and tables are cheap , so no problem there .
here 's my problem : the karaoke mc is a douche .
sleazy old style vegas for you , i suppose .
long story short : only come here if you hate yourself .
it 's cheap though , only $ _num_ a pint .
bad food is one thing , bad service makes it so much worse .
everything else sucks .
also , they have a restaurant and a metro pizza in the casino .
the sound quality is absolutely ridiculous .
remember folks , there 's a reason the steak special is $ _num_ .
it 's so hard and burnt .
is there less than one star ?
metro pizza is _num_ for _num_ large pizza 's on sundays .
in fact calling them mixed drinks is an insult to mixed drinks .
ellis island , you are dead to me !
what the hell , yelpers !
what 's terrible here ?
people that rate this place high are cheap !
bottom line you get what you pay for !
no idea how this place gets such high ratings .
about another _num_ minutes pass with still no one coming to the players desk !
screw you ellis island , you useless incompetent jerks !
the staff however , is horrible .
now mind you , this is already _num_ minutes into the meal .
the worst part is the asshole security guy who was rude to me .
it 's no different than ketchup or steak sauce .
anyways , it 's just bad news all around .
this is a horrible place .
they no longer have steak and eggs for $ _num_ !
i am so mad !
everything else is legal in nevada except this .
i know there is an _num_ in the name .
they also have some slot machines like every other building in this city .
there is also a very small metro pizza location there .
this place is terrible .
service is terrible .
horrible service and the food is hit and miss .
the chicken salad is also enough for two people .
this place is rude !
it 's a pure crap shoot here .
these people need some serious training and quality control .
i hate this place .
beers are worse than anything i ever tested .
you are way off the strip and next to a motel _num_ .
the entire place is just old , stinky and trashy .
the reason i hear is they are short on servers .
sitting here and there are _num_ empty dirty tables .
this is wrong .
the drinks are cheap .
this is total bs .
the girl running the karaoke runs it like a nazi on speed .
there is no bathroom in this place .
is it wrong ?
oh boy am i in trouble .
being an indian knows how indian food taste , smell , looks like .
the service is really really really bad .
they dont care that you want something or not .
there are just too many better places in town , i.e .
now we know why it was empty .
there 's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore .
price was ok till u realize that all food is a la carte .
i suggest everyone just ignore this and try a another one .
their prices are too high for low quality food .
i hate this fucking place .
thumbs down till they reach rock bottom .
this one only has _num_ veggie curry options , _num_ appetizer .
i wish they had negative stars for places like this .
this place is kinda gross .
at least the tables are very cheap .
the only plus is the cheap hot dogs and the cheap craps minimum .
it 's far off the strip and not worth the hike .
there are plenty of other bargain and cheap eats out there .
it is all video .
there is an over priced subway inside .
there is security and maybe one server .
it is simply just a smoking room with slot machines .
i cant imagine how they stay in business .
i 'm beyond disappointed .
there is also a discount ticket booth in the back .
you want old vegas , this is old vegas .
it looks like a little greek village on the outside .
this place is downright scary .
poor service , _num_ stars for the food still being good .
as a customer , i 'm it .
_num_ stars if possible .
service is horrible !
_num_ par _num_ 's on the course and they are all pretty tough .
it 's like _num_ min .
this time its just horrible .
it 's like playing golf through the ghetto .
i hate this place .
_num_ $ for a men 's haircut is crazy !
this place is a huge disappointment .
the a/c units are too old and sound like an engine in the room .
unless you 're a drag queen .
i feel sorry for people who did .
the casino play is horrible .
everything about this place is old and dusty .
pool is lame .
it 's like the motel _num_ on the strip .
walking into this place is like stepping back in time .
really , it 's just a change in furniture and new linens .
this whole end of the strip is sketchy .
why pay for vip .
management check her , shes bad news .
hooters is nicer than this rat hole .
visiting the riviera is like watching your dog die .
first , the whole hotel smells like smoke .
this is just unacceptable treatment .
`` im sorry thats a different department . ''
i mean , at least offer me show tickets , buffet tickets , anything .
so here is my experience while staying at this dump .
the restaurants , bars that are inside the hotel are always dead .
the food court is just nasty .
the casino is old and just depressing .
resort fee is $ _num_ per night .
it is sneaky and sleazy .
_num_ mins wait ) .
_num_ ) location is awful .
this is just a bad hotel .
this is absurd .
oh , and internet is $ _num_ .
you seriously get what you pay for .
this is the worst hotel ever .
food in the hotel is lousy .
first off , the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary .
the only good stores are the abc stores , which have very reasonable prices .
this is by far my worst experience staying in las vegas .
_num_ parking elevator is total crap .
the amenities in the hotel are weak .
the staff at the riviera is very rude !
also , the restaurant inside the hotel has very poor quality food .
okay , so i 'm a bit spoiled .
a major facelift is in order .
the non smoking room smells of stale cigarettes .
the maids are noisy starting early in the morning .
the whole place looks old , noisy and crappy .
it is a total dump .
bad service , crappy room , everything is outdated .
of course , now we are unhappy .
if nothing else , it 's cheap .
this place is really old school but i like that old school look .
it 's dirty , dingy , dark , and depressing .
the walls are paper thin , the carpet is absolutely gross .
it 's a really tired casino .
the place is kinda creepy .
_num_ days _num_ nights for $ _num_ .
it looks like a yard sale walking through the casino .
i 'm sorry sir she 's not available .
it 's awful !
the ceilings are low .
however , the arcade is pretty small .
room is nice , lock the door , dont talk to anyone in vegas !
having a confirmed reservation for a non-smoking room means just that .
the comps are virtually nonexistent aside from the standard cocktail offers .
the restaurants are just ok .
it 's far from the strip and a bit gross and very dated .
the wynn is probably the closest place at a _num_ minute walk .
now that 's poor customer service .
shame on you riviera !
still has popcorn on the ceiling , clean but not anything fancy .
is this _num_ ?
casino has literally _num_ machines .
thats how bad this hotel is .
the casino itself sucks .
avoid this place , unless u seriously cant afford another spot .
the bed covers looked too old .
r buffet has no takeout option .
the room stinks , no microwave , no coffee maker .
cheap but so are better hotels in vegas .
bed is bad , showers are worst , its worse than a motel _num_ .
the casino is too small .
rooms have a bad smell .
parking is too far .
wtf no keep my money ill go somewhere else .
it now sits empty and abandoned .
i 'm sure i 'm better off .
smoke is smoke .
i mean , their main attraction is an act i remember from the 80s .
from front desk to manager they are all rude .
you 're in vegas ... you deserve better baby .
the check-in time is ridiculous !
they have absolutely no waiting times .
this is simply unacceptable .
they have no poker room , which was a big disappointment .
there are plenty of better choices .
this place sucks .
if you want $ _num_ tables and no wifi , come here .
otherwise , it 's crap .
riviera is old tacky and lousy .
many of the dealers are just nasty !
this place is a mess !
once you walk in , it 's like instantly stepping back into _num_ 's .
it is very old , smelly , outdated and run down .
the only ok thing is the gym .
everything outside the rooms is outdated .
that 's is in top of the $ _num_ charge .
this hotel is what me and my boyfriend called `` functional '' .
answering questions is a hassle for them .
dont know if there is anything else good besides the bed .
yes , it is cheap , for a reason .
this hotel is horrible u get what you pay for .
this hotel is old , the restrooms ohhhh lord they are very small .
this hotel is sad .
towels are old , stained , & dirty .
i never seen an empty hotel in vegas before .
that was a lie , it was actually _num_ a room extra .
compared to the normal hotel in vegas ... this place is a dump .
circus circus across the street has better slots .
staff is useless .
that place is a poor excuse of a resort .
my health is worth more than a cheap room .
this place is a piece is a total piece of crap !
when you read the negative reviews here and elsewhere , believe them .
ive been here for a week , customer service is really bad .
never again for us or anyone we know .
this place is horrible !
the employees clearly have no manners or sense of customer service !
this is _num_ weeks after vegas .
this hotel is old , smelly and just overall filthy .
$ _num_ times two for the same movie ?
this hotel is dirty and the service is horrendous .
that is simply unacceptable !
the wi-fi in here is weak and slow .
this hotel doesnt have enough parking space for its guests .
this hotel is as bad as people say .
the hallways are dark , dingy and just weird .
this place is absolutely horrible .
the riviera is one of the worst .
the room is old , needs a makeover badly .
this place has bed bugs .
my first example of this is no more real perks .
it 's always worse than you think though .
they charge a resort fee will providing none of the resort amenities .
it 's cheap .
do it if you really just need a bed in vegas .
the wifi is seriously horrible every where in this hotel !
the room i am sitting in right at this moment is a nightmare .
i want my money back riviera .
the restroom , mostly the shower , smells like a combination urine and mold .
there is no credit balance on the card .
personally , i 'm surprised that it even lasted this long .
_num_ days and $ _num_ i finally have my car back .
apparently `` help '' means $ _num_ off .
just be prepared for what you pay for ... cheap work .
never give this company a down payment .
that leaves a balance of $ _num_ owed me .
replace an upper oil pan , costs me _num_ $ !
the oil pan costs only _num_ $ .
service is a little slow .
hate this store !
very limited product but what makes it worse is the cashiers !
bottom line ... this place sucks !
the fries cheap frozen curly fries with no salt .
her boss on duty has no customer service skills ... avoid this place ... .
it 's _num_ lbs .
karma sucks huh ?
the place is horrible .
fast food burritos and chili taste better .
maybe in some cases , his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works .
he is extremely rude and condescending .
on top of that the office staff is always rude to patients .
i am very disappointed in this doctor !
anyone who knows me knows that i am a makeup / product junkie !
this hotel is horrible !
the room stinks so bad !
everything is old and falling apart .
it 's definitely cheap and `` $ _num_ dollars worth '' .
your customer service department is the absolute worst .
to each their own , i guess .
_num_ minutes later i left with no help and no purchase .
this place makes me feel sick .
_num_ - you get what you pay for .
its okay that theres no casinos inside .
i stayed twice for _num_ days total , i believe i met them all .
this place is very old and kind of run down .
the beds are awful .
also they charge $ _num_ per device every _num_ hours for internet .
the hotel rooms are a bit dated .
i am hurt and speechless .
it is just nothing special .
burgers are $ _num_ each without sides .
simply put , as the _num_ stars state `` meh .
the patty is noticeably bad .
it 's cold here , like anywhere indoors in vegas .
neither does the buffalo burger , which we ordered .
i am partial to there dresses , especially when they are on sale .
this location is very small , not a good selection of clothes at all .
in comparison to my neighborhood smiths , this one is just sad .
dirty , dated , poorly run .
the employees are rude and stupid .
i hate this smiths .
it looks terrible .
i 'm truly disappointed .
not a bad casino , but the rooms are crap .
the planet hollywood casino is a _num_ minute walk away as well .
the bad : you get what you pay for .
hell , even the name turns me off big time .
the burgers and fries are just so-so .
for some reason this location just misses the point !
i know stupid me !
burgers here taste like cardboard .
alright , fine , fatburger gets a slight upgrade .
the inside of this place is worse than a gas station .
this location is a disgrace to fatburger .
again , stay out of it ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
it truly is nothing special and definitely not worth the price !
this is only my second yelp review .
they also offer chicken and turkey burgers .
the decor is outdated .
this place is a total disaster .
dont waste your money , there is next to no alcohol in them .
fatburger is all hype .
they 're just overpriced burgers .
$ _num_ is way too much for fatburger .
the bad , the price is insane .
at in n out , that same meal is $ _num_ .
there are other places worth visiting .
ordered chili cheese frys also an they sucked .
i find an add on-line that says private helicopter tours .
here is where it all goes down hill .
these kinds of stores are a waste of time .
i mean c'mon , it m & m 's .
this place is pretty cool but totally not worth wasting my money on .
where the heck is the m & m tour ?
from reading their website i guess i just expected more .
the problem is the candy costs i think $ _num_ a pound .
as expected , it 's _num_ floors of m & m 's merchandise .
it 's four floors of m & m merchandise .
it is free and no wonder there is no charge for this ordinary show .
thats wrong !
it gets too crowded .
interior in drai 's is ... .
the _num_ star rating is really a _num_ star rating .
am i the only one who feels like this ?
this club is too dark and low ceilings .
_num_ minutes later the same bouncer says the line is on the left side .
the bouncers have major attitude .
that 's ridiculous .
this is normal around vegas , not a big deal .
so sad in this day and age people are still so racist .
he again , says $ _num_ each .
oh and there is no reception in there which is creepy .
me and my girlfriend are the only asian girls in line .
i am so disappointed .
they lack customer service and no empathy .
so i wait a hour get down here .
please see the picture this is ridiculous .
they are blue ... horrible experience .
even for vegas , this place is a rip off .
it was amazing the new sign is ridiculous .
well , apparently guess is not one of those places .
which is a puppy mill and the papers of are worthless .
staff is very rude !
q : this place is awful .
trust me , twenty bucks goes a long way at this place .
q : honestly , this place is just sad .
this place is a dump .
this review is only for the casino , not the hotel .
there are better casinos in vegas .
$ _num_ beers .
they have cheap tables , i mean $ _num_ craps , really ?
this is specifically about the casino crap table .
service is dead there .
usually , you see the same slots everywhere .
there 's no theme to this place !
it 's just kind of an ugly casino .
_num_ strikes you 're out !
one of my favorites are the double crunch wings with the asian chile sauce .
me and my girlfriend visit this location often at least _num_ times a month .
_num_ stars only because there was a belly dancer .
tent looks dark and dingy rather than exotic !
even if the doctor cares , his front line workers dont .
this is a little ridiculous .
what kind of crap is this ?
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
really rude black female manager .
makes bally 's hotel look bad .
worlds most pathetic pasta and sides of potatoes .
the manager david is rude and very professional .
pasta is nasty .
employees are careless and annoying .
i hate this place .
the menu is as old school as menus get .
if you 're a young , foodie type , skip this restaurant .
bottom line is that this place is just not worth the money .
the value is simply no longer there .
there are too many other choices in las vegas .
any steakhouse on the strip is a better option .
shrimp scampi $ _num_ sent back because shrimp were so fishy .
this place is ridiculous .
they are that horrible !
they take no pride in anything .
if you need a towing service , look elsewhere .
i hate you starbucks !
what the hell is this ?
overall a bit run down and pretty lame prizes .
it is a waste of money .
there ranch was like hidden valley you get from the bottle .
you know it 's bad when the eggs have no taste and served cold .
again , gross .
they have really bad service .
this place is a disgrace to bbq and the harley name .
the current rating on yelp ( 2-3 stars ) is pretty accurate .
it 's simply mediocre .
i am sorry i wasted my time !
if you like dry ass chicken , go here .
we have the fajitas , which was cold , and the southern fried chicken .
_num_ stars because the food is edible .
the decor and ambience is tacky .
food is bad !
okay , so part of the one star rating is my own fault .
the food- they serve the usual breakfast fare .
it is $ _num_ a person .
there are much better asian options elsewhere .
it 's expensive yet nothing special about the food .
the service is slow .
i overheard two separate strangers that chin chin had great chinese food .
food is totally tasteless , big portions , atmosphere poor .
the only other thing of note is that my friends ordered three sushi rolls .
the food is expansive and too salty , no test at all .
oh , and the fruit is sour .
if you want sushi , avoid it .
the food is awful .
most chinese restaurants include rice with their entrees .
it 's gross !
for that kind of price there are simply better options while in vegas .
this place is bad .
the service is awful .
until then , there 's chin chin .
when i think of vegas , i think of good dining .
dash ... just the thought of dining , makes me ill .
it 's a shame .
wow the quality of chinese food is horrible .
i think we stayed no more than _num_ minutes .
there are like _num_ guys to _num_ girls ( if that ) .
there 's a charge and ugly people two stepping on a small stage .
you have the bartenders ( hot ) up on the bar selling it hard .
it is so stupid .
this place is horrible .
the bar itself is nothing special .
this place sucks .
the coyote ugly girls are awful .
yeah this place is horrible .
the one in vegas is worse .
i guess my group kind of stood out .
i mean , really early .
i hate the male bartender here too .
this place is an absolute dump .
this place is awful .
the only good thing about this place is the bar outside .
this place is horrible .
( we have a group of _num_ ) .
without going into further detail , kevin is extremely unprofessional .
it is an absolute train wreck .
like many of the other reviews note , these girls are terrible .
it 's a bar ... like the movie coyote ugly .
wait in line , pay cover walk in the door .
she 's alright at it , nothing special .
someone blows smoke in your face .
without the `` coyote '' experience , it 's just another bar .
hanging bras look gross .
you 're better off at a regular hotel bar .
so , i go into coyote ugly expecting the time of my life .
what i enjoyed most about this place is the music .
ps the worst .
if you have horrible taste in music , then this is for you .
skip coyote ugly !
it 's only $ _num_ '' with the rudest condescending attitude !
is unprofessional and nothing like the movie .
the dcor here has that feel of an upscale ny dinning establishment .
this place is over rated .
its waaaay too casual for the prices they demand .
i mean it 's barely a quarter past 8pm .
room acoustics are abysmal .
this is old school steakhouse style without any soul .
tourists of all ages wearing shorts and t shirts .
the staff gets _num_ stars .
french fries , which are never good cold ) .
that 's disgusting !
this is unacceptable !
the bottom line : not recommended and the steaks need salt .
avoid this place it 's just well located otherwise food sucks !
there are better and cheap steaks available around strip .
guess what guys , no soda in a properly made old fashion .
this is really about a new years eve experience , and lack of organization .
on top of that , my cut was overcooked , which is just wrong .
which is weird because it says halibut on the board when you walk in .
overall fail from this place .
very disappointing , if you know good beef , skip this place .
this review is for my visit back in may _num_ .
there is no excuse for a tough filet .
nice ambiance but i 've had better steak .
the chips and salsa are endless .
it 's even cheaper at red rocks than here .
i hate that place . '
that is so wrong .
food is overpriced and just plain .
i just think this restaurant is bad news .
only gets one star because of the chips & salsa and the margaritas .
not sure how the food is here .
as for the sides , you get your standard rice and beans .
they charge u for everything including salsa and for chips also .
you 're better off buying a dollar margarita in one of the casinos .
_num_ stars only because the meat was tender .
anyone who says this is great needs their head examined .
first off , who pays for chips and salsa ?
for the quality of the food the whole menu is horribly overpriced .
the border grill at mandalay bay is way better .
the inside of the restaurant is clean and not super noisy .
this is a large tourist trap , i mean souvenir shop .
this place is a rip-off .
i know they are on the strip selling junk to tourists but seriously folks .
most of the stuff is tacky and low quality .
shows the character of the girl in charge of make-up at chanel at wynn .
she 's very unfriendly , uninterested and unhappy .
so travelers , whatever ever happen in vegas , stay in hotel lobby .
the wifi is very slow and frustrating .
overall , _num_ star customer service in a two star hotel .
it 's extremely hard ( or firm if you prefer ) .
being in vegas in the summer , that 's a huge negative .
they have no hot water .
i 'm glad i am just a tourist .
service is very slow and poor .
the store is heavily advertised , but not open .
in addition , they are a little dry for my taste .
everything else ( from salads , sides , desserts ) are mediocre at best .
lots better in las vegas .
that is where any positives end .
i find that absurd .
this is unacceptable , especially at the mirage .
food alone , the place is probably _num_ stars .
_num_ apps , _num_ entrees , _num_ desserts , no alcohol .
yikes - this place is horrid .
this place totally sucks .
it is the biggest rip off in vegas .
i 'm so disappointed with mirage .
this place is the worst !
_num_ mins later we started on our appetizers .
_num_ mins later we started on our appetizers .
this is small portions of average food at fine dining prices .
let me just first say this place is pricey .
it 's just old school food with old school enthusiasm .
this place sucks .
the price point is ridiculous for the under quality of the food .
the restaurant is very near to to the check-in desk .
it really is a sampling of faux regional type chinese like dishes .
i 'm very disappointed about our visit .
service is terrible !
hostesses are absolutely horrible .
there 's no sense of urgency .
wait staff are really slow and disorganized .
their lunch portion is very , very small for it 's price .
service is slow .
hot and sour soup is average .
i 've never in my life sent food back !
i just remember alot of salty dishes .
really gross .
after that when we finally get to the room it smelled like shit .
they like $ _num_ .
the customer service sucks times _num_ .
after that it 's all bad !
room has a nasty smell as soon as you open the door .
what 's the point of a gate with no lock ?
it 's a disgusting motel .
the taxi cabs in vegas are a joke .
they are bad news !
_num_ days past still no call .
another week passes by and of course , no call or update .
i get another bill for about $ _num_ .
these guys are dishonest people .
las vegas , why you no have good taco shops ?
this is because it is the most expensive thing on the menu .
everyone thinks he 's an idiot , even his employees !
decor needs a major update .
that 's good , right ?
step up the game , update restaurant , the carpet is from old vegas !
quite disappointed , but at least i know .
one star is too good for this place .
buy one get one is a waste of your money .
when we ask them question they just walk away .
i guess that 's where we went wrong .
the place is under much needed renovation .
the only redeeming quality is the distance from the strip .
the is barely any water pressure .
there internet connection is for crap !
sorry , but this calls for one star .
this is more like the section _num_ motel .
this hotel is awful .
there are homeless people outside digging in garbage can .
i recommend that no one says at this hotel .
so this place is pretty cheap and close to the strip but ... .
first off , the room is absolutely disgusting .
i 'm tired .
the fellow yelpers are correct : the service is very , very slow .
this review is long overdue .
oysters are far better if they are really cold .
nobody else there deserves a star .
not good , not horrible , does the job for breakfast .
prices are average .
they have $ _num_ mimosas and bloody mart all day .
i 've had $ _num_ steak before that was much better .
i guess that 's what you get for it being $ _num_ .
thats probably the only pro for this place .
this place is awful .
instead they direct you to the hilton .
this place is the worst .
it 's extremely bad quality food and very over-priced .
their shrimp linguine special is plain and disgusting .
warning : the shrimp cocktail is four pieces for $ _num_ .
lastly , the wine selection is truly poor .
_num_ ) at $ _num_ for a filet , you expect something really good .
if you want good steaks try the station casino steakhouses !
i feel the steak was mediocre .
the food is bland at best , use some seasoning ... .
the bad part is the service sucks !
however , other reviews mention flavorless steaks .
what a seedy , dark , dirty and creepy looking casino this is .
the cheapest sandwich starts at $ _num_ .
$ _num_ bucks for two _num_ inch combos .
unfortunately these guys are not honest business people .
it all goes downhill from here .

the manager asks what 's wrong .
every time i am in vegas .
_num_ hours later still no food .
sorry we are at a private business with _num_ persons and a hefty tab .

wasting my money on food is one thing but wasting my time too ?
while i enjoy a few other wolfgang puck restaurants this one is just terrible .
short ribs _num_ percent fat .
iced coffee is terrible .
you also have the option of chipotle , panda express , or mcdonalds .
counters in the lobby and bar area are dirty and sticky .
if you want cheap check out the casino royale .
it is old and tired .
the furniture is old and worn out as is the carpet .
this is such a scam .
aside from this , it 's like an apartment .
motel _num_ is cheaper and the rooms are basically the same .
i wish yelp had _num_ stars because that 's all this place deserves .
it looks like an old apartment complex with weird rooms .
the hotel actually looks like an old apartment complex .
guess i know why the staff is sub par .

this place is very user unfriendly .
this place is terrible .
other than that , everything else about this place is terrible .

only the big pool by the office has a water fountain .
the employees here have no pride in their place of business .
the housekeeping is the worst as well .
this place is ridiculous .
found dark long hair on bath room floor , i am blonde .
it 's an obvious problem !
we give this place a _num_ out of _num_ .
wtf ... no security cameras near rooms , so thieves have a great time .
i know that the hotel around are a little more expensive .
most rude .

overall if your on a very low low budget stay here i guess .
this place is crap .
the `` tv '' is a box from the _num_ 's .

between the hotel and the reservation site no one knows .
long story short , there are _num_ major issues cleanliness and customer service .
hotel is dirty and old .
manager richard is beyond rude .
my thinking is either _num_ or _num_ .
every indian restaurant serves rice with the ( already overpriced ) entrees .
never call them for an order .
the management at this place has no regard for it 's patrons whatsoever .
so you have a $ _num_ for $ _num_ deal at yelp .
why they did this on a friday night is totally beyond me .
i 'm very patient , but not _num_ minutes of no service patient .
he said , oh yes , no problem it 's $ _num_ !
they charge for a buffet which hardly has variety .
on top of it the food tastes bad .
though charged _num_ _num_ year olds full price for the buffet .
they charge $ _num_ for the rice and $ _num_ for the _num_ bread .
ridiculous prices for such small serving sizes .
even if the food is good , that doesnt explain the bad customer service .

food is good but very bad service .
this is ridiculous .
these guys are crap .

this is bad front end management .
they 're excuse is they get backed up .
because they take too many patients at the same time .
this office is unbelievable .
here you just feel awkward .
the costco of vegas strip clubs .
there are no `` nice '' girls here .
having said that ... this club is awesome .
the atm charges are out of control .
this place is all about money and nothing else .
now , when sh*t like this goes down , i stick to my approach .
avoid eye contact as much as you can , and you 're gold .
this is probably one of the worst strip clubs in the us .
sapphire hates asians and black people i guess ?
i cant even believe im putting one star .
no excuses here .
if anyone likes this club they are full of crap .

the wait staff sucks too .
only two dancers are dancing at the same time .

male strippers are friday and saturday nights only .
did i just hear that correctly ?
this is supposedly the biggest strip club in vegas .

fine here is $ _num_ dollars now just go away .
this place is a total rip off .
this place is a ripoff .
once they start , it really gets annoying !
when we go inside front desk said its $ _num_ .
that is the only good part of our entire time at this place .
the club gets a negative _num_ hence the two .
all i ask is you assume the money i spend is important .
crazy horse _num_ is better !
seriously , fuck this place .
atm 's charge $ _num_ for a cash advance !
the biggest strip club in the us is also the worst in the us .
this place sucks in every possible way .
the manager `` steel '' is very rude .
the staff is rude .
the girls are on the ugly side .
this place is nothing but shit hole !

if you are stupid .
biggest rip-off is a better term .

the atm fees are sneaky .
long and short , pay the dancers cash .
is this it ?
maybe in las vegas that flies .
the system here is backwards .
this place is a mess .
it 's completely absurd .
_num_ star is too high .
police on property weekly it seems like .
why am i staying : lease .
if you have chinese food , you have it in the chinese restaurant .
their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush .
ok i agree w/ sean g. here ... friendly people at the front desk .
anyway ... lets get _num_ da real deal ... motel _num_ rooms !
just wait until i write corporate a letter .
this is just the beginning of my list .
i call it a garbage dump .

my boyfriend and i are from los angeles ca .
a non-smoking room ; that 's a lie .
some rooms smell like toilet .
place is a total dump .

i feel like death warmed over .
staying in this hotel while it is in construction sucks .
there is no ice maker on hotel premises .
i like the hotel towels ; they are thick .
the downfall for me is the room had an odor .
she acts like it 's my fault !
taco bell is more mexican than this place .
the only thing giving this place _num_ stars was its sanitation ... very clean .
most mexican places use refried beans .
over priced and needs some seasoning .
if you want some good food , go elsewhere , like the pizzeria .
if you want really good food , leave the parking lot .
they 're slow and unorganized .
barely larger than the cups they give you at pollo loco for salsa .
you 're better off at taco bell !
ok , enough compliments ... avoid unless it 's your last option .
this place has horrible service .
unless you want food poisoning .
first of all the selections at circus circus are minimal .
nothing express about this place .
this place is way over priced !
the pictures they post throughout the hotel is very misleading .
what mexican restaurant runs out of sour cream ?
i also ordered _num_ carne asada $ _num_ , steep if you ask me .

i 'm just so so so disappointed .
never been to a m & s since .
oysters where lousy even though this is the season .
friday night _num_ three tables being used , no one in the bar .
hmmm , nothing about not making it right but blame the customer ?
this restaurant is no exception .
a woman cleared the dirty plates away , then disappeared .
otherwise terrible service , waiters and management that makes you feel unwelcome here .
this place is pathetic !
unfortunately the action is dead after midnight over there .
this is the worst hotel in vegas .
valet parking is under the direct sizzling vegas sun !
the lobby is decent , not too loud , not too smoky .
`` and this includes the parking , breakfast , etc ? ''
for the westin , this place stinks , literally .
for comparison , luxor is _num_ 1/2 .
you get a standard westin room with standard westin amenities .
why , in this day and age , do vegas hotels charge for internet ?
hmmm ... is the westin becoming the holiday inn ?
here 's the bad .
it is only about _num_ blocks off the strip , near bally 's .
it 's like an apartment charging you pet rent .
it makes no sense .
the restaurant is _num_ hours as well .

smells like smoke in the empty lobby where they are supposedly full !
it feels like a days inn .
tube tvs are way out of date .
lobby is smokey ( but this is vegas , baby ) .
the rooms are very dated and the views , nonexistent .
on the plus side , the beds are comfy .
this is the only westin that charges mandatory service fee .
in las vegas , no one charges for parking !
why is westin charging this fee ?
this place smells like ass .
i am five foot five inches .

in las vegas , no one charges for parking !
why is westin charging this fee ?
worst customer service experience ever and i travel a lot !
how is this not criminal deceptive advertising practices ?

mostly , it 's pretty standard as far as hotels rooms go .
there 's no `` wow '' whatsoever .
pool area is a really sad place .
casino has zero vibe .
i wish that cosmo had another night avail .
long walk to the strip as well .
the westin las vegas sucks !
it is very old and rundown .
my husband and i split the turkey and egg tacos .
there 's a small casino with a few tables and a mediocre restaurant .
luckily for the hotel , my boss books the hotel .
very frustrating when customer service is non existent .
customer service is awful .
as i get to the bar , nobody takes my order .
i 'm very disappointed with this hotel .
also stains all over the carpet in the room , elevator looks super ghetto .
the valet here is extremely rude .
for that they only get one star .
it 's disappointing .
problem is with the alteration department .
this is the second nordstrom store that has issues with alteration department .
i mean so rude !
women 's shoe department is , during this visit , appalling .
this is unacceptable and unbelievable .
keep your standards even though the economy sucks !
both of them wrong .
the cardinals offensive line maybe ?
saucy , but that 's no big deal .
if you like a very strong , sour lemon taste , sure .
the actual food it 's self was cold and incredibly mediocre ... .
the food is inconsistent .
this place is a complete waste of time and money .
only come here if you have all the patience in the world .
i 'm extremely disappointed with this locations restaurant .
service is very slow .
no doubt that i am an italian snob .
there is a charge for bread .
service is horrible .
from the get go it was quite shady and unprofessional .
their online ordering system also needs more improvement .
this was the worst experienced i 've had in so long !
i 'm a vegas resident so i come to this restaurant often .
i hate this place .
the buca di beppo on lake mead in summerlin is much better .
the food is mediocre , the pricing is too high for bad food .
i 'm sorry buca - but this was a fail .
the food taste is mediocre at best .
the only good thing its that its inside one of my fav hotels mgm .
hype , food sucks , the atmosphere is kinda cool though .
way too pricey for what you get .
first off , this place blows .
second off , this place really blows .
all are very forgettable .
adult side : the food is blah .
the fries are whatever .
all together a burger , a sandwich and a shake cost me $ _num_ .
well it is annoying after a while .
the food sucks .
i hate this place !
the wait staff is rude all the time !
the drinks are small and expensive and not really that good .
i guess its food .
in my opinion , not worth the trouble when there are other options nearby .
$ _num_ for a bowl of kids mac n cheese is too much .
all in all , there are better choices out there for lunch !
it 's a huge tourist trap .
prices are ridiculous , but so is everything in vegas .
though i have bad luck with servers , so this is everywhere nowadays .
there are better choices in vegas .
i get a little sick thinking about it .
awful food , but at least it 's really expensive .
this place is way too loud .
the service here is horrible .
_num_ minutes later the manager comes to our table .
um no buddy try again .
i mean it 's really bad .
the appetizers are over fried and generally less quality than applebees .
mcdonalds blows this place away .
i guess the kids convinced me again .
$ _num_ tab for _num_ adult and _num_ kids wtf ?
in short , rainforest cafe is a poor value for the money .
the food is just awful .
the restaurant is soooo small compared to the original one .
nothing special - that about sums it up .
thinking about it still leaves me a bad taste as of today .
if you select specific foods , it is ok .
their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough .
for that much , bellagio and wynn is a much better bet .
however , they lack flavor .
there are so many other places with better sushi in town .
it is a waste of money and quite a bit of money at that !
i figured most vegas buffets include drinks in the price .
remember , there are two type of buffets in vegas .
there are simply too many other alternatives .
i 'm a big crab leg snob !
the buffet on fridays and saturdays is _num_ .
if you not a sushi eater , you are ok .
the management here need more training , kate and april .
this place has horrible management .
hello this is vegas who closes at 9pm .
ok i never write reviews about restaurants , however i will about todai sushi .
if you want good service and food , avoid this place .
dessert is sad .
staffs are very rude .
maybe they are too busy or we caught them at the wrong time .
am i too harsh ?
presentation of foods looks cheap .
restroom looks dirty , not well maintenance .
you get no cheese in this cheese steak .
food is mediocre , like every other cpk .
coming from a hospitality background , i understand that it gets busy .
maybe this location just sucks .
the food is standard and consistent .
from my experience , the service is faster .
too pricey for what you get , then again it 's vegas .
it 's a complete scam !

very lean actually , which is a sign of lower grade prime rib .
by the way , your outfits are suck .
_num_ bites in and i 'm like this is so disappointing .
their service feels old here ... as in outdated .
we figured , it happens , no big deal .
in my opinion it 's way over priced .

( it 's what i did with my kids too ) .
lawry 's you get a zero for service this night .
you have no patience for your younger guests .
i think this place is very unprofessional and careless .

confusing parking ( depends on which building you are in ) .
the ceilings in the rooms are really low .

that makes no sense whatsoever .
also , the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous !
that is so ridiculous !
that is unacceptable behavior to a guest .
chair at desk in room is steel and uncomfortable .
the fixtures in the bathroom are all old and slightly crusty .
the bathroom again is huge , but not to any purpose .
there is something about this hotel room that makes me think crime scene .
since it 's off the strip , the rates are cheaper .
no _num_ minute wait for your car here that 's for sure .
i give this place negative _num_ stars .
the casino sucks , they have like _num_ tables .
the laundry facility is nasty .
however the rest makes it so not worth it .
but i play craps and they have an _num_ second dice setting rule .
you get what you pay for , really .

customer service is very poor as is their delivery speed and product .
then everything is all half price .
pizza is terrible ... .
too much cheese where is the pepperoni and bacon ?
papa johns is usually better than this .

at least the french really know their desserts .
the view entirely depends on where they seat you , however .
also , the drinks are hella expensive and not too special .
free cheese puff - but had rye in it ( i hate rye ! )
over priced , i 've had much better french food elsewhere .
the place has great ambiance : dark but not too dark .
there are very few `` bad '' tables .

the menu is truly pedestrian with no imagination whatsoever .
the average entre price is $ _num_ .
salads are $ _num_ .
my kids are _num_ and _num_ .
like all strip restaurants it is way overpriced .

they get a `` _num_ '' for the front of the house !
this place is in a really ghetto area .
this is where the perks end .
the staff is questionable .

they tell me no , it is only mechanical ?
all of this is mediocre service .

i am angry for the incompetent work , i am angry for ignoring me .
this dealership practices deceptive sales techniques .
this place is a joke .

whether you are a veteran or not , please stay away from centennial toyota .
my wife and i live _num_ minutes from this dealership .

this is the worst car dealership in the state .

i 'm so disappointed .
eater beware this place is no good anymore .
cold appetizers ( frozen ) lack luster attitude from staff .
this place is horrible .
and then say , `` sorry it 's chicken , it that okay ?
_num_ ) do you not like a tip ?
the seats are uncomfortable for sitting as long as a movie .
the prices for concessions are comparable to any in town .
red rock is about a mile away , cheaper and far more comfortable .
i go here only when absolutely necessary .
the popcorn we get here ( _num_ year apart ) was stale .
$ _num_ compared to others that charges $ _num_ .
on the bright side , this theater is extremely close to where i live .
this theater is awful .
i hate this theater , it is always like this .
service is just way too slow at that place .
when my drink is empty i consider it a bad thing .
these seem like an awful idea .
big fail today .
man , did i have another thing coming .
which is a shame , because the folks at chop chop wok are friendly .
they provide stellar customer service .
we 're sorry , chop chop wok .
the orange chicken is pure batter and the beef and broccoli was under cooked .
i know all the big banks are pathetic .
they have all , on multiple occasions over promised and under delivered .
if you are a first time home buyer , stay away .
i work in dirt , cant have fingers with cuts .
taking two hours past the appointment time is just way too long .
you wait for hours , even with an appointment .
they make you wait forever , then rush you out .
the salon appears clean but clearly there is something going on .
the crust is thick and ny style is thin !
so _num_ medium pizza 's with one topping each cost $ _num_ !
whoa , this place is uneven .
if you take pride in your product you never send a bad order out .
you want your money back ?
the food here is way over priced .
the pizza is mediocre .
it 's like a half step above a little better .
has a thick , chewy crust and generic sauce .
almost _num_ dollars is ridiculous for the quality of food and one actual plate .
no apology , only excuses .
the communication in the office is horrible .
this place is horrible !
something is really wrong with this place .
it actually takes days maybe a week getting them to your apartment .
you 're an apartment leasing assistant manager , have a better attitude .
i just moved in and already i 'm unhappy .
i have never in my life met a more careless doctor then him .
the wait time is what i thought by far was the worst .
this place sucks .
there is a guy that works there who is totally condescending .
this is seriously the worst starbucks location in town !
the employees have such a bad and condescending attitude .
sometimes i barely get a hello which is strange for starbucks .
every time i go it 's a huge disappointment .
the clinic in this location is a joke .
bad customer service and that 's all i have .
stay away and give your business to someone reputable who deserves it .
i am very disappointed .
i have back problems , so this really hurt .
guess what , i 'm a repeat customer with obvious needs .
poor produce selections .
i sadly have a mixed review .
_num_ ) do nothing .
vca is a veterinary partner to the animal foundation .
it was sunday , so i asked about their buy one get one promotion .
gas prices easily _num_ % higher than anywhere else .
i am so tired of this market .
the thing that drives me crazy are the long long lines at checkout .
is it just me or are all the people who cashier there extremely rude ?
classy , miss hippie .
it was by all the ready prepared food that we eat .
everything is overpriced and absolute garbage .
this is ridiculous .
too bad the town square location is too far .
this is the worst bk in the valley .
the reason i gave them _num_ stars , is because the service was horrible !
seriously , i hate this part of town for this reason .
hopefully the pizza is less cardboard like .
then i said $ _num_ is the price .
still here _num_ months later .
there are so many other stores with better customer service .
the annoying guy is the assistant manager or manager .
where has the concept of customer service gone ?
it 's terrible .
go anywhere else , go somewhere where `` renting '' is their business .
if a client wants a blonde haircut give them a blonde haircut .
if you want decent food with bad service , then check it out .
the owner here is clearly incompetent .
my main concern is the woman that organized our tables was so rude .
overall the ambiance is loud and crowded .
one at the town square is way better service .
this place is just lame !
tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am i disappointed .
usually this place is busy .
however , service is nice but slow .
so here are two young ladies standing at our table with salads .
i frequent this restaurant because the location is convenient for me .
four cold dinners is far too many .
first off , this is a chain .
this place is pathetic .
this is seriously the worst .
they literally treat them worst than trash .
really limit what i buy because costco has items that is much better .
biggest issue is the store needs a major update .
who the hell is the buyer for this location ?
your out of turkey s _num_ days before thanksgiving ?
boy are you dumb .
sams club u failed !
sam 's club sucks .
he gets _num_ stars no one else there does .
this place is rude and slow as hell .
employees rude !
new management is horrible .
the management here is so so horrible .
comment below is the same line of crap you post to every online complaint .
staff lacks knowledge and professionalism .
neighbors & their pets are loud .
there 's no security .
except a car that drives through maybe once a night .
this play deserves no stars .
the lakes is a lousy neighborhood anyway .
this is hands down the worst management ever .
the people in that office are horrible and rude .
the people in that office are horrible and rude .
further , every time i call the office , no one returns my call .
bugs are a major problem during the summer .
speaking to someone at the front office is nearly impossible via phone call .
these people are clueless .
the bagels are ok , as is the coffee .
if you see her avoid her and her attitude .
she had a girl make another one with turkey this time .
it 's one of our favorite bagel shops .
these people are rude unprofessional and have no customer service skills whatsoever .
- $ _num_ , want a strawberry jam ?
always over staffed and staff is always slow .
one star is too much for this complex .
the microwave is so old and stained in a yellow and orange color .
every day they hold my money is a day too long .
the only good thing is the location and the maintenance guys .
eating it , however , is out of the question .
it is supposedly the hottest pepper on the planet ?
that 's annoying !
it 's just a weird and annoying feature of eating out .
also the sliders here are only decent .
( big dogs comes close , but not quite . )
i think they accidentally put it as hot instead of mild .
there goes $ _num_ .
there goes $ _num_ down the drain .
the kind of dough that you get from pizza hut .
it 's a bar , 2am , get over yourselves .
service is what kills it .
their staffs are quite rude .
my groupon expired feb 9th which is today .
so you get $ _num_ off ? ''
sorry , but this place is only average .
dont waste your time with this place , i wont again .
i just know that they were terrible .
it 's pretty insulting , if you ask me .
when i think of raw food , i think salads .
she then says , `` then give it to your parents . ''
`` thanks for the spoon but it still tastes like crap ! ''
they also moved the cash register around the corner which is awkward .
it smells like socks and dirty shoes .
there are _num_ floors .
not as easy as it looks or maybe its just not my thing .
the customer service here is the worst .
now here we go lol .
i like wendy 's food , prices , etc .
the female manager with red hair is rude and lazy .
fucking joke of a establishment ... you guys give wendy 's a bad name !
unbelievable ... and these are the people wanting $ _num_ an hour ?
i have no problem with that .
the fact is the car blue book value is about $ _num_ .
she has no professionalism .
i am so surprised that getting a file from your office is so difficult .
carpet is substandard .
i have the worst downstairs neighbors .
there are tons of break ins as the security here is basically non-existent .
it 's like she hates people .
they hardly carry any of their original items anymore .
a friend took me here once for karaoke -- apparently it goes pretty late .
hello , this review is on the karaoke portion of the bar .
service is friendly , but slow .
slow service and junk food are tolerable if not expected .
there 's no shame in making money .
this is a business , not a private party for all of your friends .
all-in-all not worth the extra calories .
there are a lot of angry , drunk women who come through that door .
drinks are overpriced and the service is very slow .
the layout is a very large open room with dive bar decor .
this place sucks .
the service is where it hits rock bottom .
sure , it 's a negative one !
this place has the worst customer service ever !
does any of the cooks have any taste buds ?
tables are sticky , food just sitting out in the open .
food is just bland .
ill gladly take my dentistry needs elsewhere .
the customer service is horrible .
this place is terrible now .
that 's disgusting .
this place has the worst customer service ever .
the customer service is very poor here .
we all hate you : ) go away .
where the hell is the manager ?
this establishment is garbage .
the wait times and lines here are ridiculous .
her decorating skills are mediocre compared to the other locations .
i know one think cold stone down the street much better service !
rude asian woman runs this franchise .
i think it 's his 1st day .
the new staff is bad .
it 's outrageous and ridiculous !
this place is the absolute worst !
she is horrible !
nothing has the same taste !
it says mexican fast food .
no not _num_ order of the tacos ... just _num_ small rolled beef taco .
i know that normally a taco comes with at least cheese and lettuce .
it is a shame !
volvo is very much aware of the problem .
volvo owners beware .
ok storage one is incompetent but , stuff happens .
food , aside from the potato cheese soup and cornbread are kinda bleh .
she looks like she hates her life .
for over $ _num_ the pot pie is definitely not worth the price .
finally get my burger and the fries are cold .
too bad because we eat here often .
it 's predictable .
wasted almost _num_ hours on my xmas eve .
well , there goes your french quarter theory , young man .
because it fails with all of that .
i always request my eggs like this `` two , hard fried .
burn them if needed .
the place was pretty dead , probably around 10-15 customers there total .
the whole environment just seems now like a slightly upscale dennys .
shame on you mimi 's cafe summerlin !
it 's friday night , pretty empty place , no damn chicken .
i 'm so disappointed .
seems fishy to me .
so i 'm like , ok did you call my dr ?
i arrived early as i know later in the day they get fairly busy .
there is no other explanation .
if the rating system allowed negative stars this place is a negative _num_ .
the service is beyond slow .
it really smells ... bad !
ihop is still totally overrated .
bacon & eggs , _num_ coffees & a waffle ... $ _num_ .
the main problem with the complex is security and cleanliness .
for $ _num_ i expect much better .
on a side note , the food is mediocre at best .
this is mexican food done american to the max !
macayo 's is just bland .
no tip was left which is rare for me .
drinks are weak !
food is bland !
this place is worse and worse .
this place is terrible .
the food is awful .
decor is drab and the layout is weird .
there are much better choices for sit down mexican food in town .
if you want cheap horrible mexican food this is it .
how dare you call this mexican food .
dental exams are free but of course the cleaning is $ _num_ .
this place is horrible horrific and just bad !
the x ray is $ _num_ up front !
a little caring goes a long way .
honestly only go here if you have no other choice .
this is more like a meat market than a vet !
it 's really quite sad that this shop has so many positive reviews .
it makes me feel like maybe there 's something wrong with me .
anyway , my main problem with them is about my sister .
it makes no sense .
second of all , it 's super hot and uncomfortable in there .
wan na know what i get ?
in other dominos , i get what i ask for .
_num_ hungry kids screaming i want food .
y o u know who you are ... .
dominos pizza you suck .
i am sorry i am disappointed .
the mini mart has potential .
it feels dingy and dirty .
i believe that lazy joe 's fish & chips has better catfish .
the only things good here are snow crab legs and sweet tea .
i 'm almost at a loss of words for how bad the food was .
the only pro to this establishment is the staff .
the catfish is odd tasting .
no eggs , turkey , ham or fresh dressings are available for you .
too much batter that was .
i 'm just sad because this was my special place .
however this particular branch is completely incompetent when it comes to customer service .
customer service on the phone is terrible .
they are a greasy mess of potato bits fried with onions and green peppers .
my car is barely worth that much .
and shame on them for not telling me they charge for an estimate .
i hate this dealership !
there 's barely anybody there at that time .
wish there 's another honda dealership close to where i live .
i urge everybody that 's thinking of buying a honda .
used car salesmen , that 's all they are .
they are just as bad as findlay honda .
that 's a lie .
dude , $ _num_ times _num_ equals $ _num_ .
that 's a $ _num_ increase and another lie .
tax is _num_ % .
where the customer is always wrong because they are idiots .
it makes me wonder how they diagnose problems ?
honda west needs a complete change in attitude towards it 's customers .
honda care and honda west are _num_ different companies .
they give all professional dealers across this country a really bad name !
their _num_ star review says it all .
then i politely said , `` i just have one quick question please . ''
i am disappointed .
thinking i bought my car here , this is what i get afterwards .
they have absolutely the worst customer service after buying the vehicle .
what an incompetent salesperson we dealt with at honda west .
this is the worst dealership in las vegas .
i only live ten minutes away .
( it 's half way through _num_ , btw honda west ) .
this company is horrible .
even then , if you have options take them .
cash patients pay a fee of _num_ .
the quick care opens at 8am .
now , the receptionists at the front desk are extremely rude !
the patient service here is extremely slow .
the wait time exceeds one hour .
sadly this is the only urgent care on my insurance .
damn i wonder this persons name cause they hate her .
he has an arrogant , uncaring demeanor and no bedside manner at all .
for lack of a better word , he 's an ass .
also , never got my ice water , how hard is that ?
these people need training bad .
long waits even with many open tables and sketchy wait staff .
we rather spend our money elsewhere and get greater value in return .
lets start with the service ... terrible .
here comes the actual food , that 's when the disappointment went wild .
i need another water , where 's the water ?
unfortunately the rates being charged at this facility are on the high side .
i have three dogs .
first , they do a mediocre job for the _num_ price tag .
they demanded that we pay the hospitals past due surgery fees .
and be warned that tellers have no interest in helping .
however this location is horrible !
this is very unfortunate .
this place is the worst .
i know what i 'm there for ... the bobbie .
it 's a mess .
spending $ _num_ at the place i just wish they check my order thoroughly .
you get unhappy customers .
this store is a waste of time .
store sells part for _num_ , web site says _num_ .
he had mr. jordan who is absolutely awesome , hence the _num_ stars .
cleanliness is borderline .
management is pretty bad .
think the end count on calls was around _num_ over a few days .
overall , this place is really lax , horribly managed and not very clean .
it 's unfair to everyone .
staff just seem burnt out .
they really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back .
the facility is sometimes clean , and sometimes not .
the play area toys are grimy , more often than not .
locker rooms lack in every way .
additionally , the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary .
the front desk staff is hit or miss .
so because of their policy , that 's _num_ paid classes down the drain .
the front office and their terrible policies and the fact that nobody knows them .
wait you charge me because your computer system sucks ?
the only person that talk to me was another customer , that they ignored .
talking too the workers get you nothing but headache ... .
this place is _num_ minutes from my house , so convenient !
i guess the good news is i left with all my money .
the lines are always terrible .
there are never enough tellers .
it never fails !
the food is nearly terrible .
that 's where the good stuff ends , though .
stick to the hookah , get food somewhere else .
maybe it 's me though .

it 's a _num_ out of a _num_ on a good day .
