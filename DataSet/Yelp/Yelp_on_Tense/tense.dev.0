up until tonight we ate here weekly .

first the tacos were good but not the best .
first of all the old lady at the counter was extremely rude !
they were cold and soggy .
my coffee was also cold which was a complete shame .
it looked like a fine blue collar place for pool / beer after work .
megan 's carne was dry .
they offered a free dental exam , which i accepted .
this place was very unprofessional and not very clean .
( hmmm , chris t , were you there that night ? )
it was gross .
seemed like a typical hole in the wall cheap sports bar .
the food was very bland and boring , even for a sports bar .
the first round that we ordered was kilt lifter .
for some reason she thought i was weird for not drinking that .
the chicken strips with buffalo sauce were hot , yummy , and crisp .
- they added chicken sliders .
i feel sorry for the next person who ordered the same drink .

the fries were also cold .
the manicure was terrible .
the manicure was terrible .
the couple left without getting their food .
( they had nothing near what she liked ) .
the bagels were very salty tasting and hard .
not at all what we expected .
i was glad there was no wait , which actually surprised me .
what was wonderful were the pancakes , which gave my ratings the two stars .
the only thing that was good was the sip of mimosa i had .
_num_ stars who paid for those nothing special by any means .
hey you been warned .
it was beyond dirty with zero atmosphere .
the worst part was the dirt though .
i saw dust in the kitchen area on the counters too .
the atmosphere and the vibe was definitely off .
i ordered an asiago bagel with egg and cheese .
even the regular bagel with cream cheese was a let down .

even worse , she prescribed _num_ days worth of strong antibiotics for my dog .
the dermatologist gave a wrong diagnosis for my other dog .
i got nothing from the visit and the people in the office were unfriendly .
i hated the place .
of course , they still charged me an outrageous $ _num_ for the exam .
i let them know this , they used that to their advantage .
he walked _num_ miles the other day .
like i said , i wish i did .
however this time they got me on the radiator flush .
jiffy lube cracked my radiator with their `` flush '' service .
the old nickel and dime routine was too much for me .
dont let them cheat you !
they ran out of boneless wings .
well , the salad was wrong on top of that .
she argued with me _num_ more times about letting them try again .
then they added too much salt to almost everything .
the visit cost me $ _num_ .
i called the tech sunday , no answer .
a new tech called me this time .
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .

we left without buying the tree .
she stated the price was $ _num_ .
food was cold even after sending back , beer was at _num_ degrees .

it was nothing about excuses .

either way , the customer service sucked .
the lack of knowledge from bryan was the worst .
i went with april a/c because of their great reviews online .
this was the biggest waste on money .
my husband was charger $ _num_ for one slice of toast .
i had a major purchase on one receipt with $ _num_ kohl 's cash .

never had those problems elsewhere .
not only that , a $ _num_ shirt was spotted with grease .
did this place change managers or owners ?
price was ok.
the way they submitted the loan was false which caused the decline on purpose .
tried breakfast here and was quite disappointed .
it was awful .
i ordered the # _num_ , crunchy tacos .
i had shredded beef ... tasteless , not seasoned .
the chips were stale as well .
stopped by for late night taco 's .
the haircut i received was mediocre .
i thought to myself , is this really happening ?
unfortunately it was a total waste of $ _num_ .
ordered rush street pizza for the first and last time .
really disappointed .
the pizza was terrible .

all of the chicken was pink with areas of red and blood in them .
so what was the remedy again ?
either way very disappointed .
the greens and fairways were horrible .
seriously it was that bad .
the drink girl said last call at noon with an 11:30 tee time .
this was by far my worst golf day experience ever !
i ordered the shrimp lo mein and chicken with vegetables .
the orange chicken and the sesame chicken tasted the same .
it had no flavor or very little sauce .
worst chinese food i ever had .
instead of everyone having water , they replaced one with coke .
that day was very windy and cold .
after waiting _num_ minutes , we finally got our food .
waited another _num_ minutes before a waitress came by .
steak was such bad quality .

at that time i requested a little more gravy for my hashbrowns .
i ordered the pancake breakfast : pancakes , two eggs and bacon .
a little disappointed as we came for lunch .
we were wrong .
the food was cold .
the corned beef hash tasted like it came from a can .
however , the front desk receptionist was rude , overbearing and unprofessional .
she practically looked at me like i was stupid and insane .
there was absolutely no room in their `` nail salon '' section .
it was awful !
so i called the manager , nikki i believe was her name .
the only friendly person that greeted me was the receptionist .
next i had my gel manicure .
i booked a gel manicure and a pedicure appointment for today at 4:30 pm .
the spa pedicure was just as bad .
there was no message whatsoever .
that night my eyes were red and irritated .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
the receptionist was busy getting her nails done .
sorry brow lady , but that was just a little ridiculous .
wish _num_ stars was an option .
the worst facial ever and it was _num_ minutes long .
there was no other brow lady , no other occupied shop for that matter .
way too crowded , even on weekday mornings .
well , sadly i made the mistake of coming here .
as for the food , i ordered the huevos rancheros .
the eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny !
otherwise , it was pretty bland stuff .
the strawberry pancakes were good and overall the portions were very big .
where did this tomato come from , south america ?
we waited over an hour for a table .
the hostesses were beyond rude .
the food was ok but definitely not worth the wait .
the waitress was ok but not overly attentive .
boy was i wrong .
we ordered the _num_ egg , bacon , toast that came with fruit .
boyfriend & i were in scottsdale for golf vacation so breakfast was a must .
my family and i ate here just a few days ago .
the bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather .
ate here saturday november 3rd .
later , after no other food , stomach problems and out it came .
visiting from out of town and went to the breakfast club .
the toast came cold , with no butter or jam .
however , no toast was present .
we were the first people in the restaurant at 6am .
we were the first orders in , no one else was in the restaurant .
waited about _num_ mins , not even a glass of water .
a group of _num_ of us went on a busy saturday morning .
made the mistake of not reading them before hand .
the service sucked .
the waitress sucked .
too bad we took her advice .
it was completely bland .
the flavors together were just not that good .
unfortunately , i was wrong .
regardless , it absolutely ruined my visit .
servers attention was elsewhere ... never listened to our order .
been here before and it was much better .
sent back our bloody mary 's because they were watery and bland .
sadly , the hollandaise sauce tasted more like lemonade than hollandaise .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
the last time we went , i just asked for plain hot water .
she seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time .
i ordered the jalapeno biscuits and gravy which were amazing .
today was pretty terrible .
it was okay but nothing special .
never gave us that chance .
customer service was alright .
food was cold , no follow up by the waitress , awful service .

so this booth sat empty until he got here .
that being said , the food here made me ill , literally .
she asked for some spinach added to hers .
waited _num_ mins .
there was no one at the front .
in fact , three waitresses made eye contact with us then ignored us .
a customer and a waitress ( not even mine ) apologized .
note : my party of _num_ waited _num_ hour for a table .
i had the worst experience here this morning .
boy was i disappointed .
secondly , i never asked for a free meal .
no coffee , wrong meal delivered .
restaurant was way too loud .
i again was very polite throughout my entire time there .
no wonder the stadium was half full .
i noticed two other customers walked in and nothing .
the only time they acknowledged me was when i walked to the cash wrap .
first off their website said they opened at 8am on sat .
it was ridiculous !
this place was horrible .
oh and this all happened _num_ days before my wedding !
i got the worst hair cut here !
feel like i wasted my time and money .
dude ... it was just ok .
it was a great deal - $ _num_ for haircut and partial highlight .
anyway i informed about the same myself .
i really hoped better from this place so disappointed .
the facial itself was fine but way too short .

at this point i was angry .
i was very disappointed in the services here .

i was so disappointed ... for the last time with this location .
so i went to my neighbors house and use their phone .
_num_ times in a row we had late delivery and wrong order !
so i called and was surprised that someone actually answered .
this place just lost _num_ potential clients from not answering their phones .
con : the food sucked .
it was just plain bad .
just crappy mexican food the best part was the mexican flag in my food .
it was this ... ugh .
my last lunch actually gave me the runs .
i only stayed because i was meeting friends for brunch .
the chicken and other meats ( steak especially ) was very flavorless as well .
the only highlight of our meal was the chips .
the only reason i went is because my dad wanted a taco .
i miss the days when julio g 's was down the street .

i walked in shopping for presents for numerous people .
the no rules pasta with chicken was dry .
the chicken - a grilled breast tossed on the top of the pasta .

the only thing good was the rice .
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
the food made me sick .
again , i never once worked with an actual physical therapist .
anyway , i lost my confidence in this place .
chef did a better job though .
oh and we never did get our refill on our tea ... .
the food was shit , even the raspberry iced tea had no flavor .
the persian ice cream was delicious , it smelled like roses .

i got a _num_ honda civic .
elsewhere where i got a comparable vehicle for the payment i asked for .
eventually i was - no luck on the plate .
i am however very disappointed in how they presented the vehicle .
my experience there was just a huge waste of time !
the 2nd time was an oil change no issues .
i am very upset that i wasted my time at this place .
once the vehicle was there the inside condition of the vehicle was horrible !
everything in it was either broke or just plain missing .
the pictures on the website showed no major issues with the interior at all .
the first time , i believed it was a mistake .
also , wait staff was slow and rude .
my friend said his beer was ok , so one star .

the bread was very plain , even though one slice had olives in it .
for an appetizer , we chose crab cakes .
the hollandaise tasted like plain butter .
my husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables .
i figured the _num_ stars were just people being cheap well i was wrong .

we gave it a _num_ out of _num_ .
for desert we had the chocolate lava cake .

he never uses salt and pepper out but did tonight .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
escargot was only item worth recommending .
no one called me back , no one said anything .
not only that , they used previous patients as the excuse .
a very dear friend of mine worked here for ... almost a year ?
that bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
there were only two employees .
i walked in anyway , despite thinking i was in the wrong place .
the selection was poor in my opinion .
the store made me feel dirty and cheap .

i wish there were zero stars .
they said _num_ miles is was very , very far away .

it just did nothing for either of us .
unfortunately , i came for food and not the ambiance .
i called the manager twice and left messages but no response .

the other day i ordered _num_ strawberry pancakes .
hash was cold , eggs cold .
_num_ or _num_ tables occupied .

the coffee here was terrible as well , no taste , just bitter .
my kale salad had no kale , just mixed greens that were pretty wilted .

there were no other customers in the restaurant .
it was horrible .
it was like an asian spring roll with chunks of italian sausage inside !

pity , because the food was good .
it was over fried and very hard .
it tasted like dirt .

i called in an order for pick up , it was a thursday night .
the woman taking my order told me _num_ minutes .

let me just start by saying i loved sushi _num_ until tonight .
the worst part was the service .
the girl that took my order was so rude !

i finally agreed to $ _num_ for a wash , wax , and detail .
the wax job was horrible .
i settled for an asian noodle dish with thin slices of grilled tofu .
however , a jimmy johns opened a mile or two down the street .
i threw over half my sandwich away .
the staff was fine but unremarkable , no real complaint there .
the guy who made my sandwich was super awesome .
maybe it was business attire and i represented `` the man '' , man .
the meats were skimpy , salty and flavorless .
btw one of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich .
btw one of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich .
soda was flat both times we went .
i was very disappointed after that .

seriously the worst cheba hut ever .
it made no sense .
man was i wrong !
so you just lost your employees money as well .
i had a gyro pita -- authentic , i know .

i also remembered the pitas have more in them and being better tasting overall .
instead we got dry tortillas ... at pita pit .

once inside , there was a very foul odor .
parking was $ _num_ .

over by the side wall it sounded like a mess .
a miserable experience that started before we were even in the parking lot .

there was no ac .
it was hell .
thought we were in tempe not south phoenix ... its really sad too .

place the order at _num_ , got it at _num_ .
delivery driver came without red peppers or parmesan cheese .
anyway , i delivered pizzas for a couple of years a long time ago .
how the hell can a pizza that long at _num_ in the morning ?
also , the garlic knots were raw in the middle .
with regard to the pizza , this was just not worth the first bite .
i 've had this a few times since .
the pizza was by far the worst i 've had .
it was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked .
unfortunately the pizza was not edible .
however , my first experience with gus ' was quite negative .
an hour later , no pizza , so i called .

there was barely any meat in the pho .
the rice was exactly room temperature .
then i made the mistake of drinking the latte .

so , we went on the busiest day of the week , sunday .
the green chili was very unremarkable .
my first bite was cold .
i left the place unsatisfied and kinda hungry .
the food was mediocre at best .
meh , it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner .
when we walked in no one greeted us they just looked at us .
it was extremely rude and awkward .
my dad got an egg combo plate ... same low quality food .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
for my bacon , all i tasted was salt !
first of all , the coffee was really below standard for a breakfast place .
the bill was $ _num_ for two , with a tip .
too bad , had high hopes .
i went here for breakfast with my mom and daughter .
i got french toast with sausage and eggs .
the toast was a little soggy and bland .
next to the french dip , these were the worst .
ordered the links over easy with rye toast and hash browns .
when i got my breakfast , yup , you guessed it .
i said , these are home fries .
i 'm sure she really cared anyway .
however the server forgot my husband 's bacon .
service today was terrible .
they hardly mix the ice cream and its run by a bunch of kids .
a couple in particular were super nice , hence _num_ stars and not _num_ .
really tough course and i wondered where all of the decorations were .
an hour later i received a text stating it was ready for pick up .
again got the stupid look .
no refund given , no call returned from management .
the other person waiting in line turned around and left at this point .
burned through a lot of `` plant material '' without much of an effect .
i fell for an upsell .
i got the baked pesto ziti with chicken .
_num_ minutes for _num_ slice of the most common pizza ever served ?
i hated it .
he ordered half meatballs and mushrooms , i ordered half cajun chicken and pineapple .
it also tasted like cardboard , the finest cardboard in tempe .
last week i celebrated another one my birthday with _num_ of my friends .
we had salad , pizza , wine , beer .
we sat down at _num_ , ordered by _num_ .
no one really ate their food .
so , we went elsewhere .
the experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words , sucked .
the sauce was watery and flavorless .
walked by _num_ employees on the way in and no one said hi .
the cashier then apologized on my way out the door .
i also came into the restaurant _num_ minutes before close .
tonight i came into join some friends for a meal .
it was annoying .
just ordered a cheese pizza , extra cheese .
the chicken parm was okay .
the people working here were rude and unhappy .
there were three employees and two just standing at the drink station .
both times , i left without purchasing .
_num_ workers who had zero sense of urgency .
they sold me an absolute lemon .
however the ceiling tiles were as described - in need of urgent repair .
which i had no problem with .
used the bar , got a complimentary drink , completely lacking atmosphere .
the first night i was there i had _num_ green flies in my room .
let 's be real guys - the room was $ _num_ a night .
third - it was loud at night .
valet broke my window .
consider yourself warned .

so yeah , food totally sucked .
then he walked away .
i 'm sure they heard me tonight .
there was also dead roaches and bugs under the stove !
wanted about _num_ min for the owner before i left .
her tone was incredibly rude .
when i got home the food was awful .
the spaghetti and meatballs looked something out of a can .
the wings tasted like crap .
it sucked ass .
except no one wanted it .
so , it went in the trash .
i ordered the meat ravioli and spaghetti with meatballs .
the next day , we tried the ihop on apache again .
it was your typical ihop food .
the food was heavy , americanized `` mexican '' food .
the prices were very high for such low quality .
upon entering , the first thing i noticed was no air conditioning .
the chips were stale .
then i ordered a burrito , which came with rice and beans .
the burrito was ok , as were the rice and beans .
beans and rice tasted bland like from a can .
the burrito itself was okay nothing great .
the second sandwich was a grilled chicken dish wrapped in a pita .
the bartenders were extremely rude and unfriendly .
the disappointment came from the quality of food .
this was more just pouring red pepper in my mouth .
the chicken was dry to the mouth .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
until i tried other indian places , that is .
the tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce .
i had a bad experience with the service of the place .
in addition , the hotel staff was also not polite while talking .
everything was terrible .
everything else in the buffet was cold .
the food was bland ordinary , felt stale and uninspired .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
there was only meat and bread .
horrible customer service and i paid _num_ dollars for just some meat .
however , we were very disappointed .
first , we waited over _num_ min for pickup .
it tasted like canned tomato soup .
disappointed with this place .
the wait time was dumb .
i left there in a bad mood .
none of my three children really liked it .
i almost drove away when i saw how dirty they were .
i noticed that the _num_ piece was _num_ .
he made absolutely no sense .
second and third were terrible !
i called the other local dealer _num_ miles away who were far more helpful .
the woman who answered the phone was really awful .
anyway , then she saw my credit card which was a southwest credit card .
extremely disappointed by the round we played at this course .
we played _num_ holes in a little over _num_ hours .
half of our group left after the first _num_ .
the staff was rude and unwelcoming .
only stayed for an hour because of the heat in the building .
then i did my first driving outing with them from _num_ to 9:30 pm .
the prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable .
the service was inattentive and lacking .
they remained there for our entire meal , which was pretty disturbing .
i too experienced the crunchy rice .
scam ) , they said they had no menu , what ?
all food was stale .
that was $ _num_ per glass of iced tea .
the mango lassi was too sweet too .
there was no spice or taste .
the groupon was for _num_ , _num_ or _num_ people .
with the rain outside , it only made it worse .
the food seemed like leftovers from lunch .
all the dishes were with curry stains from lunch .
sadly , it was nothing good .
i cook better indian food at home .
maybe it cost you $ _num_ .
no one had a drink except me .
that all the food was bland ?
buffet had too many similar choices .
i was so wrong .
her attitude was terrible .
they all tasted the same , with different things in them .
the food here was way too salty and bland .
the food here was way too salty and bland .
worst of all , i got sick from his food .
you just lost _num_ good customers .
i was very disappointed at the cleanliness of this restaurant .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
asked for honey mustard & bbq , received ranch .
it was thin and watered down tasting .
it was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a cosmo though .
my experience at the `` new '' tempe improv was definitely less than desirable .
like i said before , the comedy was the only good factor .
however , no one notified us .
tonight we received awful service from a server .
tonight was my first night in the tempe improv in a very long time .
so , about three minutes after i posted this , the phone rang .
it was clear that she knew that some guests had a problem .
they talked through the whole show .
our server , lisa , was slow .
after the show we learned there was some sort of sewage problem going on .
last night i gave my first low tip in over five years .
it was $ _num_ on $ _num_ bill .
i explained that i left it with our server , who was terrible .
what was the total cost for _num_ minutes of this entertainment ?
the drinks were incredibly weak .
our minimum drink tab was more expensive than the ticket .
there were no drink prices listed anywhere .
i purchased tickets for the saturday night show on-line .
it was one of the worst customer service experiences of my life .
the venue was horrible !
for ourselves , we ordered a bottle of wine ... .
we went tonight because we got discounted tickets , _num_ for each .
so ... we were like okay , whatever .
little did we know , those _num_ drinks came up to fifty dollars .
they charged him $ _num_ for a crap bottle of wine .
she tipped another $ _num_ .
the server never mentioned he added gratuity to the check .
for four drinks , one meal and one appetizer , we paid _num_ !
$ _num_ for ice tea for _num_ person served in a clear solo cups .
so two for me and _num_ for the person i was with .
unfortunately for us they somehow managed to over book the valentines package .
what really ruined it was the loud lady at our table .
it was just okay for me , dog .
neither salad came with a side of bread .
it was gross .
_num_ minutes later got an email that my order is ready .
food was bland and way below average .
this place was a sausage fest .
there was probably _num_ guys for every _num_ girl there last time i went .
in the past i 've never really had any problems with service .
this was apparently news to the bartender , the waitress and the manager .
no women customers was interesting .
( yes , i really said that , i know ... ) .
i thought the food was lousy .
the bartender from chicago was awful .
you went from being my favorite bar , to one of the worst .
for $ _num_ , it was incredibly disappointing .
i ordered an artichoke and spinach dip and guinness wings .
it was bland but overall a good burger .
they were almost certainly _num_ % soda water with a lime .
they took our reservation -- no problem .
i asked the server if the potatoes were real .
the apricot miso bowl was really sour again .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
for $ _num_ it was a disappointment .
i also got the diablo red with mock chicken and brown rice .
the last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff .
the pita chips were fried and so greasy !
the food was awful .
she was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter .
i tried a bite .
it was almost as bad as tasting ocean water .
every bite was overwhelmingly unbearable .
oh , and the food gave my friend the terrible runs .
we both , reluctantly , grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler .
unfortunately , we were highly disappointed !
customer service was terrible !
i was really disappointed .
they still failed .
the service was also really bad .
for $ _num_ a bowl , it was definitely a disappointing meal .
your coconut curry was so plain and flavorless !
i wish they were open for sunday breakfast .
very disappointed they ran out of average things in the menu .
the fries were also mediocre .
it was too garlicky as well .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
it was a simple request and the customer service was completely horrible .
looked like it was out of business last time i drove by .
there were only about three or four tables with customers .
the guy just gave me a short `` no . ''
you 've got _num_ other rooms , put me in one of those !
the guy at the front desk was cold and unfriendly .
it was disgusting .
not having that money made our trip back home very difficult .
jay -- -- the manager , was here tonight and a total douche .
only went as long as i did because it was walking distance .
food was ok nothing special .
i truly believe waitress was racist for us being brown .
food was typical bar food only worse .
my lunch overall , was just so-so .
the waitress threw numerous amounts of napkins and utensils at me ... .
first time i tried the cheesesteak it was garbage .
weeks later and numerous phone calls later , they never did .
they lost my clothes after i confirmed they had them .
then recently lost _num_ shirts and _num_ dress pants when dry cleaning .
i bought my tickets through groupon for $ _num_ each .
it said it opens at _num_ .
then i checked the yelp reviews and yelp said they open at _num_ .
the bathrooms were just disgusting .
each time i used the restroom i never once saw people wash their hands .
this weekend was terrible !
the place was small and underwhelming .
very poorly managed .
so bizarre , so i politely asked him why ?
notified management who had zero amount of empathy or concern for other guests .
bathrooms were disgusting .
the worst part was the people that were there .
man was i wrong .
i threw them away of course .
there was no really exciting rides at all .
most slides were simple and boring .
beyond disappointed i wasted _num_ hours here .
the meat in the meat sauce tasted burnt or extremely over cooked .
i ordered a caesar with chicken .
a shame because the dressing was pretty good .
also the meats and cheese were just thin slices , nothing of exceptional quality .
at $ _num_ , this was a miss .
my wife had the gnocchi this time , which was a bit tough .
what i ordered was very forgettable .
_num_ ) the food was mushy and tasteless , like bad nursing home food .
this place was an insult to italian cooking in general , let alone sicilian .
on a saturday night at 7:00 pm , this place was out of manicotti .
an old dude did my pedicure .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
i signed the voucher for $ _num_ for _num_ tickets `` on sale '' .
i like gammage , but i feel like i wasted $ _num_ .
my husband and i attended our first gammage event in april of _num_ .
the sound at each show was just as terrible .
parking was easy , staff was great .
there was no food offered on there menu .
the acoustics as always were terrible .
left `` wicked '' less than a quarter into the show .
the sound quality was poor even though they supposedly upgraded the system .
asu gammage was horrible , even though the show ( wicked ) was amazing .
other than that , it was ok .
that was highly disrespectful .
i just got a take out from here , the beef kabob .
i had a kabob dish which was mediocre but definitely not worth the price .
made my stomach turn _num_ mins .
many of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice .
even meat items had no taste .
the chicken was also fail .
there was confusion about chicken combo vs. chicken .
service was all over the place ranging from ultra attentive to absolutely clueless .
the only good thing was the fire roasted tomato and the beef kebab .
i ate here weekly for years , sometimes twice a week .
a vegetarian haven , it was .
the sandwich was $ _num_ .
the sandwiches were nothing special .
this was very disappointing !
it was low quality , high calorie and not very subtle .
the rice was probably my biggest complaint .
the tortillas , salsa and chips tasted like they came from a grocery store .
for starters , the chips and salsa were pretty average .
rosita 's was a real disappointment .
i chose wrong .
the chips and salsa were okay , not great .
it was sorely disappointing .
tonight is saturday and we were the only _num_ people in there ?
yet , our server was below average ... way below .
decent appetizer platter ... minus the fact that it was cold .
the food was completely bland .
the salsa , refried beans , tamales , etc were all tasteless .
even the chips seemed stale .
the only mexican thing about this place was the music .
it was brutal .
the water tasted like sewage even after adding _num_ lemon wedges to it .
beans were very standard , chips and salsa were okay .
the water was absolutely horrible though .
the chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy .
when it arrived i was so disappointed .
cant understand why there were so many customers there .
i felt sick to my stomach for the next _num_ days .
this time around , it was lackluster at best .
the place looked dirty , dingy .
the chicken was pink and rubbery .
there were maybe 10-15 other tables in the whole restaurant .
i lost my best friend , of _num_ years .
this made it even worse for us .
man , that was a disaster !
the whole place was completely unsanitary .
however , it was a total buzz kill for our saturday night .
we immediately had our room changed to a room overlooking the parking lot .
i was very wrong .
the airport shuttle was very useful as well .
it was like some sort of sleep torture .
my sister and i stayed for _num_ days for personal trip to the university .
last time i went , my roommate ordered `` vegetarian spring rolls . ''
there was no one in the restaurant .
they had made cause it was cold .
so the food was kind of cold and mushy .
i ordered the chicken lo mein , big mistake .
the dude who took my delivery order was really rude .
i also felt terrible after i ate them .
mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish .
( yup , you guessed it onions ) - see photos .
the rice looked like potatoes it was so overlooked .
ignored me .
i found _num_ peas and _num_ carrot chunk in the whole thing .
the chicken lo mein had breaded chicken in it with no flavor .
i ordered a chicken teriyaki and hunan shrimp on a very slow sunday evening .
save your money , the lunch special bbq pork was terrible .
disappointed .
after a few bites , we threw the entire dinner away .
he went into the back several times and never really offered help .
we waited several minutes before being greeted by a rude young lady .
nothing was horrible .
not appetizing at all , pushed it all to the side .
this place was unfortunately not all that amazing .
i got the combination plate and everything on it was pretty mediocre .
no hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita .
it was nothing special .
the rice was just plain white rice .
our server had zero personality .
so i found this little market place serving mediterranean food .
chicken was burnt .
so $ _num_ off the tab was the only option they given me.
rice was okay , nothing special .
he had a sampler with grape leaves , meat balls , rice , etc .
food was painfully bland .
wish i tried the falafel instead .
after all the outstanding reviews i tried the chicken shawarma sandwich and some hummus .
the sauce they added was all that saved my lunch .
it smelled like fish tank water .
that was the last straw , i was out of there .
my family and i had an awful experience here tonight .
thinking back some of the cooks had no hair cover .
drinks again were left bone dry .
i tried the yogurt soda which was disgusting .
i just walked out of this place because the waiter completely ignored me .
waited _num_ minutes for my food .
i just walked out of this place because the waiter completely ignored me .
it did .
star _num_ : how was the service and atmosphere ?
star _num_ : how were the portions relative to the cost ?
no star granted .
no stars granted .
no star granted .
she was zero help .
went there tonight .
unfortunately that was the highlight of the plate .
the sauce on the meat was too heavy with lemon .
the dry rice was under done and again had the overpowering lemon .
sadly , the only decent main dish was my son 's spaghetti and meatballs .
it looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is .
service was terrible .
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
service was ok , friendly but nothing special .
this time the food was awful !
although my plate was full , my boyfriends portion of fish was small .
she explained that the waiter was new and his section was the biggest .
sat there for _num_ minutes before getting up and leaving .
the veg was also under seasoned , just bland tasting food .
this place has went downhill in a serious way since i was last here .
service was so slow .
the salmon i ordered was raw and fishy in flavor .
my wife and i ate here last night .
i had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce .
i paid _num_ $ a month for a level _num_ ( gold ) membership .
every time i walked in no one was at the front desk .
after the discount , they were $ _num_ .
we moved from across the country into this crap hole .
if there was only an option for zero stars !
she was very rude .
this was the most embarrassing , disgusting night i 've had at a restaurant .
they , too , offered no apology .
the problem came later .
we had mini chimis , beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy .
the spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too .
the service was very slow .
they tasted ok ... not much of a drink special .
when we arrived _num_ % of the restaurant was full .
_num_ minutes after that our server took both drink and food orders .
then it was another _num_ before we received the drinks !
the only dinner that was edible was mom 's appetizer sampler plate .
went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while .
in short , he sucked .
i recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago .
our server was nice but not very informed or attentive .
i was extremely disappointed in the food .
i went there most recently for sunday football ticket with _num_ friends .
i was very disappointed with my recent visit to this macayo 's .
the chips and salsa were just okay .
the service was bad .
i had a baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada .
my fianc had a bean burrito enchilada style .
the baja chicken enchilada was pretty good .
the cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh .
first , i ordered a standard margarita .
all together , about $ _num_ overcharged !
we left with nothing after sitting here for an hour and a half .
we got nachos with beef , guacamole , and baja sauce .
* shark tacos - i thought the shark meat gave an interesting twist .
the shark meat was slightly on the salty side though .
i visited macayo 's because i heard that they had a gluten-free menu .
my fajitas were very bland in flavor .
again , guac was gummy with a strange taste .
they were extremely slow waiting on us even though the place was empty .
service was horrible !
food was totally plain jane and overly greasy .
this was my first meal in tempe , recommended by our hotel concierge .
both sauces were awful .
we asked for more of the watery , chunky salsa for her .
i ordered two enchiladas , and all rice , no beans .
my wife ordered the chile relleno , all beans , no rice .
drinks were weak .
instead of the waitress apologizing she just disappeared !
hate that we wasted so much money there with our group .
nothing had any flavor at all !
nothing had any flavor at all !
that entire experience put a bad taste in my mouth for all macayo 's .
yeah this place sucked .
then my mother in law ordered a patron margarita , it was over poured ?
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
they want money ... you got money ... enough said .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
they even gave me a couple batteries , which was very nice .
i then proceeded upstairs to the sales dept .
the rental equipment was far from new .
thousands of dollars lost .
price - $ _num_ for _num_ rolls of film done in one day .
we all ate cereal at home it was so bad .
in terms of taste however , he said that it was okay .
the food quality was bland with no flavor .
i tried this place for the first time .
rice was dry as well as the tamale .
the table seemed bare , salt but no pepper or hot sauce .
i sat there for _num_ hours .
we also ordered a red velvet and a vanilla bean cupcake .
the street people and homeless were loud and rude .
she was horribly unhelpful and almost rude at that .
i was there _num_ night .
i explained i couldnt as my husband was at work with our truck .
she said large dogs are no longer welcome .
they were rude to each other and to the customers .
indeed , there was history in this restaurant and on the walls .
i ordered chicken eggplant .
tried this place for lunch last week .
the place is pretty busy , which seemed like a good sign .
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful .
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ .
therefore , we paid this place a visit .
got the runs the next day , ugh .
so disappointing , at least it was cheap .
we were very disappointed .
our ac and tub both clogged yesterday right after their office closed .
okay , so i went there for lunch today with my son , jacob .
my nachos , however , were inedible !
the chicken was lukewarm and really funky tasting .
the burro was okay , not great .
the chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment .
boy was i wrong !
so i spent another $ _num_ on that .
however , they lied .
they next day the price they quoted me was different yet again .
