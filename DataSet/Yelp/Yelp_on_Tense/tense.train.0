very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .
food was mediocre at best .
what i was into was the german potato salad .

bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .

it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .
going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?
house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .
we also got a chicken ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed .
we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .

it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
the worst part of this last visit was the service .

my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .
the next morning we went down to the front desk again .
there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .
i was so mad .
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .
yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
i got home and no extra sides .
i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
_num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .
today i gave them _num_ chance .
i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .
first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .
i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .
she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
finally , overall the prices were way too high .
my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .
the salon itself also disappointed me .
in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .
it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
stuck in my lease until february .

the rest was dry .
it was disgusting .

there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .
while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .
the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .
i figured wrong .
well hell , what was your first guess ?
i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
it was very disappointing .
owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .
it was frustrating .
unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
there was also no pineapple chutney .
neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
my first impression was the outdated decor .
the food was mediocre .
visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
we went back in the main door , clearly confused .
the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
the sauce was disappointing .
one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
nothing was dry ?
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
i became very angry .
she was as useless as a tsa agent .
unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .
okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .
it was really , really , not good .
a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .
service was indifferent , at best .
it was dry .
after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !
i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .

the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .

it was all french fries and very little meat .
the service was terrible .
it was unbelievable .
the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .

the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
i chose poorly .
coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .

before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
it was just strange .

this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .
they were rude .
firstly , the food had no flavor .
neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .
the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !
for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .
essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .
so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .
the bread was the worst part .
came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
also , parking was shit .
this place really did suck .
i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .
for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
for one , the service was terrible .
for all the hype this was very disappointing .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .

the auto show was a disappointment .
all in all , it was a disappointment this year .
the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .

i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
it was also very dry .
i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?

the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?

the beef pho was sub par .
i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .

however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .
the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .
the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .
first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .
the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
i expected bland sushi .
man , was i wrong .
the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .
actually , everything i ate was mushy .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
i swear it was worse than my first experience .
the dough was also fairly dense .
the cheese ruined this pie .
neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )
the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .
overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .
the service was terrible .
at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
this was a horrible experience .
none of them responded to me .
i sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me .
it was horrible .
they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .
no , she went ahead anyway .
for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
massage but still had a _num_ hr .
i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .
the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .
it looked horrible .
she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !
i felt horrible .
she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .
i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
i have no clue what they gave me .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
it was gross .
this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
they offered me nothing .
she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
the bed was dirty too .
she was clearly in a hurry .
they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
the haircut was $ _num_ .
the head massage was painful and rough .
poor customer service and they were rude .
i was disappointed .
first , they messed up one of our pants badly .
rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .
the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .
last night the service was especially lackluster .
unfortunately , the food was mixed .
i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .
last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !
it was very cold .
for the very first time the food was awful .
a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
tandoori salmon was average .
after the renovation the place lost its center !
it was horrible .
sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
it was sad , really .
it was dry and average , at best .
service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .
i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .
she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .
she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .
so , that was really disappointing .
there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
this place just bored me .
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .
the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .
once seated , service was extremely slow .
service remained poor .
the place was mostly empty .
the third took another _num_ minutes .
the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .
the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .
so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .
update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .
the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .
the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .
the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .
the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
the bloody mary was completely disgusting .
it was god awful .
it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .
had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .
honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .
my reuben sandwich was just okay .
my lil heart fell .
lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .
each visit was more bizarre than the time before .
overall , my haircuts were never good .
i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .
i paid $ _num_ for a partial .
the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .
i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
i was there for over _num_ hours !
it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
further , they were unapologetic when i complained .
the food was terrible .
was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .
for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !
the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .
i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
the chocolate was too sweet .
this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .
the toppings on my salad were barely there .
that exchange was awkward too .
this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .
the small package was _num_ dollars .
that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .
i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
the only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there .
the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .
i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
my feet were still rough .
it was horrible .
however , this past visit was unfortunate .
the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
we were disappointed .
the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
my wife had a chicken special .
that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .
luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .
this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .
this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .
as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .
treated badly .
she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .
by this time , i was through with this place .
i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .
i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .
i thought this was way too much .
this was my big mistake .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .
it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .
the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .
not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .
the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .
we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
even the orange juice was bad .
the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .
i made an appointment weeks ago .
when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
just getting off work , i came alone .
neither of us were surprised .
this was sorely lacking .
the costumer service really ruined my experience .
i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .
the worst chinese food i 've had .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .
it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
the soup was a weird creamy mess .
in fact , it was awful .
the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
our food was cold .
delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .
the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !
it tasted rotten and disgusting .
worst chinese food i 've had in ages .
we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .
_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .
service was horrible .
food was mediocre .
crab cakes were awful .
sure she knew that rude .

nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .

there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .
i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .
when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?
the tree died .
after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .
she received neither .
the service was poor .
unfortunately the food was a let down .
i had a bad experience at penn automotive .
the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .

i was sick to my stomach when i left .

it tasted like hot chocolate .
ok i said i was sorry .
the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .
as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .
ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .
the food was even worse than i remembered .
the food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table .
asked for a manager , she never came to the table .
like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?

it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .
it was loud and crowded .
firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .
sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .
the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .
it was just okay as a whole .
for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
she gave me an attitude .
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
the bread was even bad .

the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
overall , the experience was horrible .
the service was horrible .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .
the food sucked .
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !

the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
my server was horrific .
she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .
he said , `` no , absolutely not .

at that point our drinks were empty .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
there i was very disappointed .
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .

really made me sad .
its not like she got nothing out of it !
the fries were bad .

too bad , jared 's .
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .

when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
then all the food was cold and hard .
dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .
they damaged my car .

the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .

it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
there was no attendant at the booth when we left .
lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .

it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .
the place was so slow .
most of our bill was the wine .

as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
the bread was cold and hard .

tried their philly cheese steak .
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
it was kind of uncomfortable .
walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
wow , i was wrong .
i found all of this very unacceptable .
the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .

it was like eating outside , except we were indoors .
the prickly pear margarita was very small .
it appeared the az restaurant week menu was our only option for dinner .
neither dish had much flavor .

anyway , the restaurant pretty much blew .
well , that was stupid .
- the sauce was mediocre .
maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat .
my husband and i ate here after i purchased a groupon .
the few unique exhibits were very underwhelming .
the race exhibit seemed like a huge waste of space .
i thought that was lame .
this was god awful .
besides that the information presented was short and not in depth .
our ears ringing , we wandered around visiting the exhibits .
the heartbeat drum was cute , i guess .
totally boring , i am glad my trip there was free .

i knew immediately that something was wrong .
it was all really inedible as was the menudo that my girlfriend ordered .

my husband ordered the bell pepper chicken , which was just ok .
the chicken egg roll was very greasy .

they had a dj playing music at an obnoxious volume .

basically told me i was s out of luck .
after waiting half an hour i requested a refund .
in our time there perhaps there were _num_ patrons , including us .
aaron brothers got your ass yelped on yelp mart .
i purchased a _num_ x _num_ print recently that i planned on framing .
i did notice that there were two employees present and one customer , me .
the service was horrible !
she spoke to me as if i were below her .
what i got was _num_ sandwiches no cheese and all of them had lettuce .
this was a total disappointment .
the management was none too concerned .
but wait ... did you call the desk after talking to the dr ?
the blood draw itself took under _num_ seconds total .
i accepted this appointment , having no other choice .
having no other choice i accepted this new appointment .
pros : the corn bread , green beans , and creamed spinach were delicious .
the salad was your standard plate of bland greens .
it also cost more than it should .
the staff was friendly , i mean at least they smiled .
the autozone kid was super helpful though .
came across a very terrible worker here .
the clientele was like a scene out of dawn of the dead .
my fav 's were the spinach dip and the wings .
waited _num_ min .
we waited _num_ min , not even a greet or anything .
their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning .
left without eating .
he turned my experience around for such an awful beginning .
wait was terrible on a late thursday night .
finally seated , _num_ mins before they took our order .
last i checked i 'm pretty sure that was the servers job .
food was disgusting .
on july 2nd , _num_ , we visited this applebee 's .
it tasted bad .
staff was friendly , restaurant was moderately clean .
after much discussion they cooked another egg .
meal was overall gross !
no one ever apologized at all .
it was absolutely horrible burger and even more horrible experience .
i was very disappointed in the quality of food !
stopped in here a few months back .
`` , which as a side note i thought was somewhat rude .
the first thing i noticed when i walked into the place was the smell .
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
one of the deli cases actually just had chips in it .
for starters , my friend and i ordered sizzling rice soup .
it was very meh .
it was very bland .
the beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland .
i ordered the orange chicken , fried rice , soup , and crab puffs .
pork fried rice , lemon chicken , and sweet and sour chicken .
chewy flavorless pork and little rice rocks were in abundance .
it really had no flavor at all .
my first review of china chili was _num_ stars .
within hours , i suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning .
the prawns were good but nothing special .
i only ate _num_ or _num_ bites .
the sesame chicken was the same way .
i had sweet and sour chicken , pork fried rice and wonton soup .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken spicy and the crab puffs .
the taste of the chicken was gross .
the crab puffs were awesome .
lacks in flavor regardless of dish and the meat was just suspect .
overpriced chinese food and only tasted mediocre at most .
we never got enough silverware or soup bowls .
i also told her the soup was cold .
so i only ate half of each .
food was horrible .
first there was no crab in the crab cheese puffs , just cream cheese .
however , the food was very bland .
even the egg rolls were bland .
watered down sauce .
they were awful .
i just paid $ _num_ for two drinks .
it was amazingly gross .
the frozen desert , chocolate , had no taste at all .
it was cold , creamy and without any flavoring .
the salad bar lacked all kinds of meat for the salads .
they made a big issue out of nothing .
it was almost embarrassing being the only asian person in the place .
my orange chicken , however , was tough and rubbery .
we went through the drive-thru around 8pm last wednesday .
both bowls and gyoza came to $ _num_ with tax .
veggies and chicken were okay too .
the sauce served with them were good though .
there was almost no teriyaki sauce on my meal first of all .
digging into the teriyaki chicken i found a lot of vegetables and little chicken .
they had no interest in talking to any of their clients .
the haircut was expensive for a barber shop and not good .
well no wonder her chair was empty , she 's a horrible barber !
they lost my lunch business for today .
my only concern was how well they cleaned the blizzard machine .
just looked like it needed some cleaning .
no one got sick so probably fine too .
they were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers .
talked to someone else .
the bagels and cream cheese were good , but not outstanding .
the real negative for me was the restroom .
first time shame on them , second time shame on me for going back .
terrible service and no apology for the fact they they totally dropped the ball .
very disappointed with our purchase and the service we received afterwards .
the only good thing about this visit was the receptionist .
hardly anyone was there .
the layout of the place was somewhat unusual .
the two beers that i had were decent but not amazing .
the service was awful .
also i noticed the menu was really , really random .
the weather was fabulous .
she returned a few minutes later for our order .
atmosphere was very lame for a thursday night .
even the root beer was flat and tasteless .
mediocre food ... if it was what i ordered .
the beer was ok but nothing great compared to other breweries around town .
from our three drinks ordered , we only got two .
it was also a bit dry .
been here before and it was way better than this last thursday !
that was before she completely ignored our table for _num_ mins .
my favorites were the hefeweizen and vanilla porter .
it took another _num_ minutes on top of that .
never once did anyone bother telling me what happened .
honestly , no one even gave a sh*t either .
my buddy even commented on that after we left .
no one even cared .
they were the ones conveniently located at the bottom of the stack .
starting off , the pasta was over cooked .
i ordered a large mac n cheese and the garlic parmesan fries .
unfortunately we both left hungry .
my drink was empty the entire time .
staff was a plus .
i 've almost never had a bad experience w/ hilton staff .
it looked cheap .
we thought is was cheap vinyl .
the bed was awful .
i stayed at this hotel for a conference in october _num_ .
this happened to several of my other coworkers as well .
everything about this hotel screamed tired .
beyond the convention cleanliness issue , everything was old & tired .
how in the heck did someone get a key to my room ?
- i really liked their chicken noodle soup on the first day .
in fact , they never even returned my fucking call .
you just lost your company a regular client lady .
just disgusted that i threw my money away .
the receptionists treated me poorly .
btw - the place was empty at 10am on a saturday .
i got no where which the corporate office also .
she supposedly even called .
i drove an hour total through this whole process .
dont waste your time !
i refused .
it was a waste of time and gas .
also all the techs continuously talked to each other and rarely to their clients .
i had the worst experience here .
the woman who did my nails did a horrific job .
i payed $ _num_ for sh*t acrylics .
the nail tech named judy made both of these experiences extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant .
`` what the hell just happened ? ''
the only positive note was they have an extremely friendly bouncer .
service was bad .
the worst part is the `` manager '' never made an appearance .
there were many waitresses fighting over our table , we were so incredibly uncomfortable .
as though i were in the wrong place .
after getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa .
took one bite of the salsa , that was it.
i was severely disappointed .
the service was horrible .
the staff was friendly , just incredibly slow .
granted , the restaurant was full .
the chips and salsa were eh , ok .
i ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco , no sides .
the food was bland and not too flavorful .
unfortunately , a person in our party found a hair in their taco .
it was also fairly bland .
visited juan 's after reading the numerous complementary reviews .
it seemed like your basic run of the milk - nothing special mexican place .
the flavor was very blah .
chips and salsa were old and tasteless .
taco shells were old -- meat was tasteless -- rice was cold .
the bill was $ _num_ !
the chicken was so salty and the pizza was burnt .
you did nothing right in this transaction .
it was almost laughable .
but the alfredo the dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me .
was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta ?
for starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip .
total ( not including tip ) was about $ _num_ .
it was thick strips that tasted very very fishy .
when it arrived , it too , was way over salted and tasted stale .
that said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable .
noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method .
the chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style .
i barely finished one slice .
it was bland & tasteless and way too oily .
it was simply the worst lasagna we ever had .
the person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good .
on top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza .
food was good , service was terrible .
the whole experience was rude .
everything i ordered was less than awesome .
we had the worst service ever !
i was so disappointed !
tonight ... this place was horrible !
what i got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste .
our _num_ minute wait was close to an hour .
entree salad was fair .
shrimp diablo was too hot .
dip was good , artichokes were a little tough .
there was barely any pineapple on it .
we were so hungry and craving pasta from oregano 's .
i was so mad at that point .
this was such an awful experience .
crust was ok and the pizza sauce was bitter .
she the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us .
overall this place was just a let down .
however , the problem just occurred again today .
everytime i hit this mcdonalds it 's so slow ... .
i was there approximately noon .
i left _num_ messages with people and _num_ messages on their machine .
this struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait .
for just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $ _num_ .
when they handed me the sandwich i was really disappointed .
i actually felt really awful about myself for having ate it .
it was _num_ with a drink .
service was slow and rude .
seared tuna ... was far from seared .
sushi rice was a bit soggy too .
i ordered the clams in broth .
that tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake , not the cheesecake .
i opted for the shrimp udon soup .
i ordered pad thai no tofu again mild .
this particular night , i opted for the miso marinated sea bass .
the server never brought it to me .
the sushi was c grade .
the miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it .
order was slow .
sushi quality was bad .
husband had chicken parm .
also - the food was very bland .
however , the service was less than stellar .
there were just _num_ of us and _num_ dishes between us .
there was hardly any miso in the soup .
turned out that was a big mistake .
the other one was even worse .
barely acknowledged when you first walked in .
i always substitute rice noodles , never had an issue .
this was my first time visiting cherry blossom noodle cafe .
i really wanted noodles , ie a noodle bar .
there were only two other tables being served too .
bread was basic bread , nothing special .
it was very busy .
unfortunately , it was downhill from the point we got our food .
ordered the sushi combo , added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice .
got the pad thai and added chicken .
at a table for one , i ordered a squid salad and three rolls .
i probably wont b back .
surprised with all the yelp reviews ... disappointed .
on the downside , the service still was horrible in every way .
the place was totally empty .
i 've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry .
neither were very good .
i just was speechless at this point .
i left with utter disappointment .
he even rushed our forgotten to-go drink as we got to our car .
the rice was a little hard .
there was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm .
this strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake .
however , the service was really bad .
dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so .
udon soup as did my co worker .
soon as i walked in a was greeted and sat .
my food was lukewarm if even warm .
the only good thing about my food was the rice .
this time around , yakisoba was super oily and bland .

this telephone call occurred on november _num_ , _num_ at approximately 6:00 pm .
everyone else at the club was friendly , helpful , and welcoming .
mexican pizza was extremely gross .
the buttons were off of it .
no one apologized still for it .
saved myself $ _num_ .
i was certainly wrong .
11am i called for update .
however , i had my first frustrating experience .
i did so for today , calling in the morning for a 1:30 appointment .
so they kept my car all day with no warning .
once he left we were unsure of what he actually said .
the salad had more then enough dressing , luckily the dressing was good .
the plate looked very plain with items not being placed in any nice manner .
funky house salad with a creamy ranch ( ? )
white french baguette bread and butter was plentiful , thank god .
the fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it .
my husband had a pasta with italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce .
the chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing .
things started poorly .
instead , they had it for _num_ days .
neither my husband nor i cared for it .
so i went inside , wondering if it was an april fool 's joke .
when i went in , there was a guy behind the counter .
it was really uncomfortable ... .
she just stared at me .
puff pastry was flavorless .
however , i did like the service !
holy mary , mother of god , was i dead wrong about that .
seriously , i was a wreck .
my gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a sat .
all in all , fuck that place .
our experience here was crappy .
like a damn toddler screaming for attention , that 's what she sounded like .
the dealership was less than this repair shop .
she later had a man talk to me that was just as condescending .
thanks but no thanks , i left .
the wait time for my appointment was long .
the office sent over my rx to my local cvs .
once again the reception person was not only unfriendly , but downright rude .
me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant .
it was firm , but not dry , and full of flavor .
`` dude , i just said _num_ . ''
+ previously mentioned worker was friendly .
( issues , lost time , money and gas i lost . )
the all time worst experience i ever had with an auto dealer .
spread the word about this horrible excuse for a business .
had an issue purchasing a vw back in _num_ .
my purchase experience was just o.k .
my salesman was marty , who was very helpful .
barry , my salesperson , was wonderful .
he first showed us this car in awful condition .
went through all the standard bs that buying a new car comes with .
everything went downhill from there .
it appeared that they they just gave it a quick wipe down and vacuum .
i brought the car back the next day and the customer service was horrible .
i waited _num_ hours for nothing .
the local dealership never responded to my complaint .
my finance advisor had me come back and sign my contract four times !

ordered a combo : sour cream enchilada , taco and tostada .
they were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top .
sadly , we found jordan 's .
the service was terrible .
it was edible , but not great .
what we got was gray meat , with not one ounce of seasoning .
the most disappointing part of the meal was the salsa .
i ordered a chicken burro enchilada style .
the enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless .
this place was absolutely terrible .
my _num_ minute interaction was enough .
my tostada on the other hand was good .
other than that , it was an ok meal .
never rated a place this low before .
the menus came with dried up food on mine .
it tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well .
chips were good .
was sadly disappointed .
never did anything wrong to this woman .
four times she repeated herself regarding her class .
there was no compassion and advise from the sales clerk .
it was definitely not hot enough .
the dining area smelled like a bait shop , the bathrooms smelled even worse .
gave us a ridiculous quote on a simple solution .
which was very unprofessional .
there was no sauce in my rice bowl .
it was just chicken , rice , egg , and green onions .
even for fast casual japanese food , it sucked .

all i asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese .
i paid for my salad and my wine because that 's all i ate .

thin crust pizza was horrible .
they lost a customer as a result of the lack of good customer service .
she never apologized .
the sandwich itself was forgettable .
thin crust pepperoni was very blah .
jalapeo peppers were average at best .
it was really just average food with not so great service .
her effort gave the place two stars instead of one .
within a week all of my clothes and towels smelled musty and its terrible .
hubs and i stopped for breakfast .
let 's just say that he had a very condescending attitude .
waitress was kind of mean to me when i asked about the wifi .

we went for the beer specials , which were good .
all were simply horrific .
it was bad .
everything was bad .

we not greeted by our server , _num_ different servers walked past us .
it was actually kind of a pathetic looking sandwich .
unfortunately that 's exactly what happened this past saturday .
apparently that threw the kid totally off .
they got my order wrong .
so i spent about $ _num_ that night .
my experience was horrible .
the whole ordeal came to about $ _num_ plus tip .

none of it was good .
calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere .

my meat was over cooked and not seasoned well at all .
my boyfriend stated that it was under par for him as well .
she gave me a _num_ % discount on the steak only .
the food and service were poor at best .
they actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips .
he ordered guacamole with his and i asked for sour creme with mine .
other than `` spicy '' -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors .
maybe it was just an off night for me .
i immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning .
this really turned my stomach .
visited the gilbert restaurant tonight at 7pm .
no one apologized or explained why our food took so long .
no rice or beans and our bill was $ _num_ !
me & boyfriend stopped in after work , sat in the bar .
skip this place , overpriced .
today 's experience was awful !
i just had the absolute worst experience ever at a restaurant at this location .
the bad part was the food .
the worst part was the service .
i told her she was rude and disrespectful .
salsa was horrible .
ok first off the decor made me feel dirty .
rice was very bland .
the cream cheese sauce was kinda weak in the flavor department .
chips and salsa were ok .
the decor had a layer of dust all over it .
it felt very _num_ inside .
my last visit was terrible .
served moldy tasting chips in a dirty bowl .
the beef enchilada had fatty pieces in it .
other than that nothing was worth eating .
this was no big deal to them .
it was offensive .
my wasabi mashed potatoes were tasty although there was no hint of wasabi whatsoever .
i had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great .
clearly annoyed when we had a question about our bill .
if only zero star was available .
i looked around with a customer service rep , who was in fact friendly .
today was sadly no different .
my phone was worthless .
i asked an employee for help ; he sent me to the geek squad .
the second one they installed had a bubble underneath .
the bill was $ _num_ .
just like everything else , there was no presentation at all .
recently purchased a car here .
i asked for a break in the price , to no avail .
i thought ok , my fault for not looking at the mileage .
i was very disappointed in the entire experience .
it was truly nasty .
it was empty .
there was no trouble finding an empty table outside .
- veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh .
i ordered a blt on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw .
i tried the tuna on white rye .
unfortunately , it was quite dirty .
so this was a bit of a turn off .
so i left , extremely upset , without my medication .
i needed this script asap so i killed time in the area .
my doctor gave me this for a reason !
use it for animal medication , as long as it was available .
the pharmacy gave me someone else 's prescription .
going through the drive thru was a very unpleasant experience .
the tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling .

the food was of poor quality .

both were totally incompetent and uncaring .
this was responsible for all of my pain !

oh , he missed my left arm all together .
i had the same experience as dana b below .
customer service was horrific !
too expensive and had my computer for over a month for a simple repair !
the whole thing seemed so fishy .
of course , danny 's car wash was not responsible .
they stole my change ( probably over _num_ bucks ) .
this last time , it really looked like they just vacuumed my car .
danny 's was a _num_ star car wash _num_ years ago !
when they flagged me down , i walked around the truck .
no sir i just want my car washed .
today was ( again ) a poor experience .
i later noticed that money i had in my car for parking was missing .
on a previous trip , they stole my husbands phone charger .
my $ _num_ car wash just became a $ _num_ car wash .
there was an attitude of less than mediocre at this place .
i paid $ _num_ for a crappy car wash .
the place made me feel uncomfortable .
i was so wrong .
no hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said .
again , this made no sense .

so sad that management let it go !
the entire visit was totally disappointing .

it was $ _num_ for a medium sized bowl and drink .
sounded like it to me too originally .

this was my first visit to this specific location .
the top part ( roots ) were alot lighter than the bottom .
they never once acknowledged me .
the sandwiches were ok , we ate them there .
the raviolis tasted freezer burned and the sauce tastes as if from a jar .

he brought the regular menu that had no desserts on it .

there were also water marks left on both side of my doors .
very unhappy with the service i received here .
this place was a complete let down .
the purse was only a month old .
this time it left me without a purse on my work trip .
i was very disappointed with how gucci in scottsdale treated me .
during a second experience , i had gucci sunglasses with scratched lenses .
wow was the customer service horrible .
it was a very romantic anniversary , let me tell you .

her attitude was unacceptable .
my club sandwich was mediocre at best , nothing special .
i just left .

food was cold and poor quality .
this was just flat out rude and very disappointing .
pricey , ambiance was very nice but just not my cup of tea .
the mojito was horrible , we never got greeted .
he sat down with us in the booth .
a few times throughout our dining experience here , our water was empty .
she loved hers as did i when i had it .
she sent the manager over who was also low personality and very snooty .
luckily before purchasing my mac i researched until i knew exactly what i wanted .
the experience itself was more than frustrating .
i have no problem with that , never did , never said i did .
i hated that my first impression was a line of people .
this was a bit disappointing .
you really left me no choice .
the `` help '' i received at this apple store was laughable .
they were very helpful .
they got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the genius bar .
employee kind of got defensive when i called him on his lack of professionalism .
i had a guy that was really just not friendly .
talked to me like i was just an idiot .
of course the overly pierced hipster stopped us dead in our tracks .
the customer service , however , i had a big issue with .

he was great , but sadly there were too many other things wrong .
yes they honored my warranty on my car battery .
morning crew not helpful .
i remember very little about the meal because the service was horrible .
for a dinner that cost more than $ _num_ -- i certainly expected more .

the cocktail waiter offered no wine suggestions .
we were extremely disappointed .
we went for sunday brunch this past weekend it was about _num_ % full .
no wonder there was valet out front !
this meal was a disaster !
pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce .
wait staff was just okay .
for the main course , i had the boar ( $ _num_ ) .
my wife had the three fish entree ( $ _num_ ) .
the sauce was the only thing great about the entree .
my bill was $ _num_ before tip .
my husband and i probably went with the least interesting choices .
the lobster was just ok , the basil pasta was overcooked .
we sampled the duck tamales .
unfortunately , there was nothing special about this dish .
the salmon quesadilla was much better .
the tenderloin was decent but a bit overcooked and not inspired .
the chocolate tart was the best dessert on the prix fixe menu .
their wine list was extensive but grossly over priced .
how embarrassing , after telling everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants .
we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine .
and sit we did for _num_ minutes without water or menus .
_num_ minutes later , no joke , we got our croissants .
then _num_ minutes later came our cheese plate .

i wasted _num_ hours it was the last time i went there .
no wait , office staff was friendly .

i used just one session .
very poorly maintained .
no towels provided in the gym .
i wasted an hour of my day .
it was a nightmare .
lily at the self checkout was rude and not helpful at all .
as of november _num_ , this place changed hands .
our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that .
the mushroom hot pot was ok but a little bland .
in fact , it fell quite short .
also , there was a bad odor in the air .
$ _num_ was the cost of this dish -- for lunch !
the soup too was only lukewarm , and very small cup size portion .
then about _num_ minutes after that we ordered .
bill was $ _num_ and i paid _num_ .
anyway , that was our experience .
it was so confusing .
it was such an incredibly rude service .
this place was gross .
rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile .
it was so gummy and tough !

i waited like _num_ or _num_ min longer than it usually takes .
the mac salad that people love so much had a fishy taste to me !
the beef was borderline gross with the texture and bad flavor !
my rice was so soggy and mushy .

then she and the manager walked back to me .
`` no , '' she replied .
the white rice was old and dry .
it was cold .
bean and cheese burrito was awful .
got horribly sick about _num_ minutes after i finished my meal .
we waited _num_ - _num_ mins for _num_ burritos !
it was downright rude and condescending .
the hot sandwich i ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy .
so i gave them another chance .
it was so bad that it literally fell apart when opening up my bag .
i just threw the sandwich away .
i lost meatballs left and right and eventually just ate with a fork .
i also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted .
she was very rude to the customer .
they ruined our shopping day .
this gas station stole my fucking money .
if only there was an option for zero stars !
my last customer service experience was horrible .
i left disappointed , irritated , unsatisfied , and out of $ _num_ .
( i had it checked out at different place ) .
i was flat out lied too .
when he showed it was the wrong door .
while i waited _num_ min for my burrito , i saw _num_ major issues .
however once i stepped out of the reception area , i was instantly uncomfortable .
the cashier offered me another item which was almost _num_ dollars more .
we selected western dental due to my husband 's tooth pain .
the issue tonight was a matter of health .
simply put , the steak in my burrito bowl was grossly undercooked .
so undercooked that the meat was actually cold .
then they just put pico on and look at you .
tonight they ran out of chips .
i went straight from the restaurant to the house .
guacamole was flat , no flavor .
the steak was horrible tough , is it always like that ?
they opened _num_ minutes late , leaving several people waiting outside .
overall vibe of the place sucked .
even the cashier , which surprised me .
when i got home , the lettuce on my bowl was all brown .
i had the worst experience at this chipotle !
she was so rude .
however , it was more expensive than other shops in the area .
the place was basically empty , only _num_ tables had people sitting .
that was too much for this guy apparently .
she said no one !
my massage was a complete waste of time .
in my opinion he used too much polish .
they also did a poor job .
stopped here because i was in the area .
boy was that a big mistake .
that was one of the worst pedicures ever .
she was a little aggressive with my fingers and not gentle at all .
like the other reviewer , i experienced constant delays .
either she was just having a bad day or she totally hates her job .
my sales associate lied to me .
my roommate and i were furious no one notified us of this !
under her breath and walked away .
the tenderloin burger was very plain .
this place is way too expensive for the mediocre food served to you .
way too overpriced for the quality of food !
we sat with empty water glasses for almost _num_ minutes .
the food was just not that great .
it was fine , i guess .
we shared some chocolate dessert , which was good .
the whole entree tasted at best bland .
desserts were nothing worth writing about .

the food was just average at best .
the food was bland and uninspired .
the problem was with the food .
the service was terrible .
it was dry .
had desert and a cup of coffee ... $ _num_ !
it also had no seasoning on the meat at all .
at _num_ $ i expected a little more .
our server was lots of fun and very professional , but a little slow .
booked thanksgiving dinner for _num_ people a week in advance .
confirmed the reservation _num_ days in advance for a private room .
fell far short of expectations .
they offered incredibly weak compensation , but of course this was a wash .
guess we really were sol .
this was the most offensive part of the meal .
helped ourselves to our purchased water bottle put on service tray several tables away .
had caesar salad w flat iron steak .
seemed like bad tough cut of sirloin .
i spent $ _num_ on a bagel , cream cheese , and a coffee .
the other half was basically dry .
the first time , i thought it was a fluke .
it makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was .
iv had horrible service before this was beyond that .
i got ta turkey sandwich or so i hope with a soda with ice .
the bacon on the turkey club was undercooked .
oh and the trash can was dirty .
the absolute worse haircut i 've had at this establishment .

i just left lol .
i went there about two years ago .
he quickly gave me a refund .
the man working was so cold .
the woman working was seriously rude .
made my sandwich completely wrong and super sloppy .
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
when she was ready , she took me into yet another room .
she was almost $ _num_ off ( not in my favor ) .
sorry dr. smith , you just lost a patient !
i made the situation very uncomfortable .
because i was loyal , i stayed .
the kitten was weak and in poor condition .
i declined the testing for that as it was expensive and unnecessary .
she strongly suggested blood work , which of course is nearly $ _num_ .
i spent $ _num_ for blood work .
i have had far , far , far superior pedicures for $ _num_ .
if you want a list of who actually used the valet , forget it .
my husband and i looked at each other wondering , huh ?
no one from management met me .
unfortunately , i had a bad experience at tj cooks restaurant for lunch .
i ordered the flat iron steak and eggs .
except for the hash browns , the rest of the dish was inedible .
this was also disappointing .
the problem lied in the staff .
there was a girl walking around but she avoided me completely .
the lady who helped her was rude , cold , and short .
the hot sandwiches were luke warm .
indifferent counter help on their best days , downright surly on their bad days .
i got a chai - it was weak and not flavorful at all .
sure the massage was decent ( not in price mind you ) .
i was sadly disappointed .
the thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech .
even the pool was a disappointment .
again , i said nothing because my cat was in her care .
however , i recently had a bad experience with this vet .
there was an emergency going on with another dog when i arrived .
she never called me back .
i was mediocre at best !
the breakfast i received was barely room temperature .
wish i had more passion for the place ... .
it was definitely longer than _num_ minutes .
two two items together totaled $ _num_ .
so , essentially , i paid $ _num_ for a pack of english muffins .
two other women chose lgo for a business lunch last week .
i chose a caesar salad from the case as i was in line .
`` no thanks '' i told her .

the first time i was there it was very crowded .
i had a similar experience with snotty cashiers the 2nd time i went .
it was disgusting .
the egg white omelet was flavorless crap !
the wrong bread , and yep , they did it .
no big deal , as it moved quickly .

really disappointed as i live only a block away .
the pizza was very very average , maybe they had an off night ?
the bad : service was horrible .

i got the gel french manicure .
unfortunately , my experience was everything but that !
the lady who did my pedi was terrible !
it was such a rush job !
no joke he spit on the floor right next to the public water cooler .
she ignored me .
the lady very quickly put on one coat of the polish i chose .
my feet looked so bad !
looking for a place closer to home based on reviews gave it a try .

i just left literally _num_ seconds ago .
lost a star because they opened the garage door .
not good , , too small ... n its overrated !
the wine our waitress suggested was the only redeeming part of our experience .
food was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ... .
two people ordered bruschetta , french onion soup and different sandwiches .
that already left a bad taste in my mouth .
the veterinary assistants were very friendly .
i told him no thanks .
dr. rice was the only vet i liked .
no other vet did that .
i made an appointment for him at banfield , just because it 's convenient .
overpriced with no real selection .
sadly , our other entree was much worse .
so-so and have had better .
it sucked shit .
okay so last night _num_ of us came here for dinner .
this havana cafe location fell very short of our expectations .
he gave both of us a really crappy vibe .

the whole time , we wished we had the other waiter .
over priced , plastic chairs and the food sucked !
so i had another chicken dish .
it was very ick to me .
for the appetizer , i ordered the beef empanadas .
the rice was as plain as jane .

first , i ordered wor wonton soup .
then came my chicken chow mein .
my sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland .
the beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked .

this dish was an embarrassment to salads .
unfortunately our lunch was only fair .
our waiter was so-so .
i told wally i thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his .
the only other time i saw the bartender was when my glass was empty .
maybe today was just not a great day for them .
gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup .
i just left a sad tip .
the huevos rancheros sucked .
it was like $ _num_ for the _num_ of us !
secondly , it was severely undercooked and runny in the middle .
there were several less than pleasant surprises .
it was also not warm .
that surprise was a $ _num_ meal .
while waiting for our meal , i drank most of my coffee .
this was just one disappointment after another .
i ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa .
costco referred me to this place .
i lost the screw in my glasses .
the owner was friendly , the service was prompt and fairly priced .
he refused .
they sent me to the frame doctor .
disappointed overall .
i gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good .
it was surprisingly busy .
so , why was it so busy ?
she actually never said `` hello '' and never smiled .
i met the doctor for only _num_ minutes .
this was the first frustrating issue .
it was horrible .
( none of them were `` cheap . '' )
this time it was extremely frustrating .
my acrylics tho was a totally different story .
this place just refused service .
there work has got so poor !
especially this dude they hired .

their donuts were dry , my local donuts shop have way better donuts .
so i went to this place a few times .
our enchiladas were stone cold .
got home _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
chips were stale .
horrible service hot as hell inside and everything was dirty .
it felt like a chicken fried steak .
we started our meals with salads .
my entree was equally as disappointing .
she soon regretted her choice as much as i regretted my lasagna .
tried this restaurant this past friday for the first time .
it was just ok.
my husband hated his .
those parts were there , just a very old school approach .
i took some old navy shorts in for my _num_ year old son .
it was a waste of time .
she was busy so she called me a few hours later .
so i asked why was it $ _num_ for something so small ?
she also told me that she gave my grandma a deal .
seriously my experience with this place was awful .
the guys serving was very friendly yet slow .
told you , lots of excuses and false promises .
dont know why i came back to this location a second time !
so , i went to a different store where they were awesome .
when asking for my keys back , he refused .
what made all of this even worse was the owner was a total jerk .
it cost me $ _num_ and a lot of time and energy .
there was absolutely nothing wrong with the house .
the buns were really mushy .
well , the chili was disgusting .
the burger was awful ; it had no flavor whatsoever .
the food was great , the customer service was horrible !
chili - there was sugar in the recipe .
for all the great toppings , that chicago style dog was a bust .
sad because the burgers were quite good , sliders were so-so .
last week i purchased _num_ `` raspberry fuzzy '' plants .
you have _num_ % lost my family 's business !
no mango with rice because they were out of season .
its like walking into a mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were chinese .
apparently its bbq so i settled for the sesame chicken .
the green curry was a lumpy , floating in grease mess .
i went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food .
they brought me a rice dish .
tonight was the night .
so instead i had some yellow curry with potatoes and chicken .
the rest of our meal was just mediocre as well .
she , unfortunately , spoke very little english .
we made our order , beginning with chicken satay .
the second time i came with my husband , the service was deplorable .
then waited another ten minutes before leaving .
greasy , gross , packaged mix flavors .

we had several problems with equipment that we recently rented .
the dr. never returned my call .
i had no negative experiences with this clinics until today .
i am so sorry i did .

no help offered whatsoever by the person taking appointments .
chris responded `` we are big _num_ , what is customer service ?
fifth , no one talked to each other ... awkward .
i went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today .
anyhow the eggs and bacon came with that , they were cooked okay .
never had this issue .
so i made them give me my money back this morning .
they lost another customer .
i purchased a $ _num_ sectional from them .
she ignored me .
so we wandered up there on our own .
they said no and suggested i cancel my order .
boy , was i wrong .
on the morning of the delivery , i called for my window .
fell in love with a set and bought it immediately .

i had no privacy and no help .
there was no other option .
we seriously wasted our time here .
the security guard at night called me a racist name .
the mashed potatoes were even worse .
food was the worst bbq ever , horrible , ribs were rare ?
yes pink stuck to the bone not done , threw them away .
this sandwich had exactly meat , cheese ( extra _num_ cents ) and bun .
tried the pulled pork sandwich , rib tips , and potato salad .
i ordered the chicken n ribs dinner .
overall experience was just ok .
the chicken was also ok .
the food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality .
after a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $ _num_ .
it was about _num_ miles more .
check-in , however , was ridiculous .
the worst experience i had for car rental ever .
when i complained , they treated me like a liar .
maybe it was really me because i did business with them .
our flat tire light also went on midway through our trip .
so i recently rented a car from my local hertz .
our number was _num_ .
my company arranged this rental so i have no choice this time .
unbelievable ... ... waited an hr for the bus from the terminal .
after reading bad reviews about other car companies i went with budget .
i didnt notice it on my bill either till i returned the car .
every question i asked she lied about costing me an additional $ _num_ .
then i called from st louis where we landed .
i wish i 'd checked yelp before i booked .
sorry , you lost me with this one .
believe me , there was no stains !
i recently rented a car while in the area for thanksgiving .

returned without problem .
i had a manager come out because he was so ridiculous .

their customer service reps on the phone were terrible as well .
this was by far the worst rental car experience of my life .
she was just horrendous .
they were on number _num_ .
budget employees created the problem , own it and correct it .
they refused .
no discount offered for the inconvenience .
worst experience i ever had at a car rental .

well guess what no one showed .
to which he responded again with another insult .
i also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price .
and my brother in laws baked fish smelled just god awful .
the shrimp had too much batter .
fish and chips was very bland .
it seemed fresh , just lacking .
the fries were disappointing too .
this place was the worst !

the last time i entered was was cuz purely by accident .
ate here on a friday night with a friend .
the place was busy which is usually an okay sign .

in the terminal _num_ section of southwest , there was a bar and grill .

all of the information boards only provided flight information for that terminal .
this time it was on the southwest side !
unimpressed .
my boyfriend and i recently had a layover here .
no checked bags .
went straight to security and barely made my flight .
they only looked at my boarding pass .

terminal _num_ security grossly understaffed .
this place had _num_ , one security line during the thanksgiving weekend .

some were attractive .
i almost just got cold stone for breakfast .
a nice green chili burrito sounded just right for 9am .
$ _num_ after tax , that 's what i got .
only saving grace was that the side of salsa was very spicy .
the burrito was surprisingly small .
the beef in the burrito tasted like school cafeteria stew .
_num_ minutes and $ _num_ later , i felt gross .

slowly but surely it was as bad as before .
that was a terrible example for mexican food tonight .
my husband and i went there for dinner last night ( drive thru ) .
im glad i took my business elsewhere .
this place sucked .
no customer service skills and food was ok .

the liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy .
had my first and last dining experience at liberty market .
sicilian pizza was awful .

although the line was huge the tables were about half empty .
the asian cucumber salad was bland .
maybe i just had a bad experience .

there was nothing `` cake '' about this pancake at all .

my husband said no thats fine .
what really bothered me was the rolls .
the albacore tuna had a very weird consistency .
i went to this vet back in _num_ .
my gel was terrible .
the second time they did it , same thing happened !
i went originally because the reviews were good .
oh yeah $ _num_ was supposedly with a _num_ % managers discount posted outside .
i asked for a fake set manicure .
super disappointed i spent any money on this place .
staff was more interested in their group conversation than helping answer my question .
true to what other posters said , the staff is rude .
the pizza was gross .
the staff was rude as hell .
found a bolt in our pizza !
they were very unprofessional and slow .

- the guacamole was mediocre at best - again seemed store bought .
- the chicken seemed very low quality ... definitely dark meat .
we ordered tacos and a burrito which were both bland and disappointing .
the service was slow , even with just two other parties present .
no , not the burger joint , that 's how my experience went .
there was no personality in any workers .
it was just completely awkward .
as for the taste , it was ok .
unfortunately , there was nothing especially outstanding or extraordinary about this place .
the egg batter for the chile relleno was literally egg covering the relleno .
the steaks were really thin .
the water tasted horrible .
i agree w/ the other reviewers who mentioned the salsa was good .
the chips , though , were a bit too thick for my liking .
when i got the burros home they were basically all potato .
it reminded me of a baked potato with a tortilla wrapped around .
the chorizo was about the same , very very little meat .

the focaccia and fries that came with it were soggy as well .
in reality , i was there because i was hungry .
sweet potato chips were bland .
beer was cold .
i had some drinks and appetizers , one of them being some wings .
i ordered a focaccia with balsamic sirloin , mushroom , onion , and cheese .
service was incredibly slow .
the problem was there were no heaters outside , no wonder it was empty .
all of our food was cold when received it .
the first sip was like drinking a sugar mix .
the chicken fingers were okay , nothing special .
it looked like a turkey wrap .
ummm no it was more like a tortilla bread wrap of some sort .
so , my friend and i payed the bill with our money .
the place was pretty empty .
my wife , however , ordered a chicken club .
this time , however , the service was mediocre at best .
terrible service - waited an hour for our food .
the service was awful .
we waited _num_ minutes for our first drink .
apparently a lot more difficult than i thought .
i was a loyal customer for over _num_ years .
however , there was nothing spectacular about this hotel .
it was small , stuffy , and poorly equipped .
that surgery in seattle , although a failure was a very simple recovery .

we were very disappointed !
probably the reason the restaurant was fairly empty .
it was an odd mix of bridge club and bar star .
my last visit we ordered the artichoke dip with chips .
the food tasted like cafeteria food very average .
the woman returned , no greeting , no smile , no nothing !
she said nothing , just walked us out the door to the patio .

she was totally rude and sarcastic .
so i wrote them a check for _num_ .

this was unacceptable .
only issue here was the rude bartender for our big dinner event .

once we took a bite into it though ... .
very little cheese or sauce and what little cheese there was had zero flavor .
driving around looking for pizza , came across this place .
was very very grumpy .
the crust , sauce , and cheese had virtually no flavor .
guy looked at me like i was a ghost .
each half of the pizza contained the exact ingredients i wanted for lunch .
i reluctantly ate the slices given to me only because of time .

she had no idea what half the charges were for .
there was no music or anything , just utter silence .
went tonight , french fries were cold .
hamburger was cold .
never had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night .
when i walked into the store it was filthy .
the staff was rude .
the new price was $ _num_ .
changed my mind after the last interaction .
spent $ _num_ .
lunch service was slower than expected - only _num_ servers but with _num_ parties .
it was a serious problem !
it was really bad .
i 've had two big problems with this place .
second problem came when i took my mom there for lunch .
the food itself was good but lacked spice .
nothing was fresh , just loaded with fat .
the chips were slightly stale .
over the last six months this place has went downhill fast !
the chip and salsa lady made more visits the waiter .
ok no problem it was really busy and lots of big parties .
service was polite but super slow .
it was a bad first experience and a last one for me .
definitely the worst experience i 've had at a nail salon .
they were ignorant and racist .
when we walked in the place was so dirty and dusty .
a couple weeks later , i had a terrible sore throat .
the staff was very unprofessional and apparently very unorganized .
chili oil not hot , so it never did get spicy .
_num_ ) oil tasted old .
i felt a little insulted since i had the cut before .
that was a mistake .
they mentioned it as is it were a courtesy .
however , they still pushed the `` kitten package '' my first visit here .
that really bothered me .
long story short , the doctor was about _num_ minutes late .
there were dead scorpions and roaches all over the place .
once contract signed , service ends .
i made all payments on time as requested .
she said the hygienist was nice though .
one dentist i had was in a rush .
she was very rude and unpleasant .
service sucked rude not friendly .
a friend of mine got sick from eating at the downtown at the location .
i love chipotle but just had the worst experience .
their mild salsa was old and mushy !
prices are high , staff was nice .
customer service was terrible this visit .
only gave it to stars because my last interaction went well there .
i saw that the company responded to my review below .
they never responded to my email .
they failed that chance .
i repeated my order _num_ times to the boy at the drive through .
there was no soda fountain , only canned soda .
so i lost weight sweating while eating lunch .
ok so this was my first time going here .
the only decent thing we got were egg rolls .
she was extremely rude .
the fried rice was just way below my expectation .
this place sucked .
some of the worse chinese food i 've had in awhile .
einstein 's served stale bread on my tuna sandwich today !
so it was my fault ?
wish there was a good alternative nearby .
i waited _num_ minutes for a simple sausage and egg bagel with a chai .
i watched _num_ orders get messed up within _num_ mins .
another person got the wrong order .
the restroom had no soap , no paper towels and no toilet paper !
dont waste you time here .
unfortunately , they were noticeably crooked and uneven .
he was busy in his office chatting with another employee .
nothing helped .
finally , i switched doctors to another group out of frustration .
the nurses cared more about how old i was then my sons health .
it was atrocious !
we were there a total of _num_ hours .
was too greasy for my taste .
the food was extremely disappointing .
this restaurant gave me the worst service ever .
my daughter , granddaughter and i had breakfast there this morning .
i had _num_ cups ... my daughter had one .
all we got for an additional $ _num_ was an empty cup .
received a one thousand dollar charge for an ear infection !
waiting a month or so she made an appointment elsewhere .
customer service on the other hand was awful .
portions were decent but lacked taste .
shrimp was literally like eating shoe leather .
found a stone the size of a dime in the hot and sour soup .
the beef skewers were dry and greasy .
there were _num_ other pets waiting in a fairly small waiting room .
luckily all the pets were friendly with each other .
this was our first visit to this place .
she left the room without saying anything else .
the surgeon spoke to me over the phone , telling me my options .
the office was old dirty and smelly .
the visit was a waste of time and money !
i wish i did more research before i took him here .
so why bother since i was leaving anyways !
it was very plain .
when i got there , i noticed the dim lighting .
she said _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later i got my pizza .
ordered _num_ pizzas last night with wings one loaded other with cheese only .
the loaded pizza was a soggy mess in the center .
wings were good nothing special .
i 've had two bad experiences here , both were the same issue .
like they built it in the basement of some _num_ 's ranch house .
not only that , but there was hardly any vegetables or chicken in it .
the food was mediocre , i ordered the pad thai spicy .
i refused .
well how completely wrong i was .
there was no one at the counter , no customers , no staff .
after i finished my fries i went for my fish sandwich .
it was terrible though .
it was flat like a pancake .
it was old and stale .
the drive thru and the eat in area was empty .
burger was under a warmer ( heat lamps ) yuck !
got this crap .
i waited on thursday , friday , saturday , monday and finally called them .
like other posts , i never had a return call back .
it had _num_ windows , cost $ _num_ .
quoted price was $ _num_ .
sunday , between _num_ and _num_ they said .
this all happened within _num_ minutes !
got a gift from my daughter that she purchased at worst buy .
their stock is crap , glad i dumped mine quite a while back .
so the salesman sent me to another store down the street from them .
he was behind the register chatting with a customer about tech bs .
we had a series of upsell questions in a very pushy , rude manner .
very rude , the manager had terrible service and communication skills .
from when i got my copy of diablo _num_ from them .
of course no one there cared .
this store sucked .
i purchased _num_ tvs from arrowhead best buy in august for my new home .
i also purchased a protection plan so that nothing goes wrong .
they ordered _num_ parts for me based on what they felt it needed .
she was very very rude .
sure enough there was a step he forgot .
wasted _num_ min of my life .
the operator transferred me to the store manager john ( sp ? )
this was a bad decision !
its really pathetic because she followed me the whole time .
i just wish that the employees here knew more about their products .
its small bar that wishes it was a night club .
so i ordered the carne asada tacos .
a friend of mine recently insisted on going to macayo 's for dinner .
the service was terrible .
margarita was weak also .
damn drinks were $ 10+ .
the food was ok but not much of a selection .
came back _num_ times asking if we really wanted it with guac and beef .
it was nothing more than microwaved , canned , pre packaged junk .
dont waste your time or money on this place .
when we walked in it smelled like a restroom .
the service though was awful .
sat there for _num_ minutes being completely ignored !
tonight was horrible !
my husband bean and cheese burrito was half the normal size .
food was gross .
waitress was terrible .
the night was a horrid mess !
food was alright , a little over cooked .
super saucy , cheesy gooey mess of a platter i had .
by mistake , she received a cheese enchilada instead .
however , the rice and beans tasted way off .
my tacos were cold as well .
you were rude today !
um yeah i just drank coffee .
coffee tasted awful , never had this bad coffee before .
my hair was down to the middle of my back .
that was a bit rude on my part i guess .
mind you my rent was _num_ per month , _num_ more months at _num_ .
in the summer rental rates go down last i checked .
instead you just posted it on my credit .
my food was terrible .
ordered chicken nuggets and french fries .
i ordered my meal with no mayo .
, treated me like an idiot .
gave me real attitude .
somehow glendale gave these people a _num_ star ?
i substituted the rice that it normally comes with for vegetables .
but my god that was way below average food .
my bottled beer was about $ _num_ .
the cashier then overcharged me for my food .
chorizo and egg burrito was very greasy .
i only actually needed _num_ filling .
i used this dentist for at least a couple years .
i had tooth problems every month or so according to them .
they lost my business for good .
the place was completely empty so i made my way right to the front .
also , i purchased a dog bagel , it is hard as a rock .
it was just really really bland and not at all spicy .
left my thoughts at the `` tip '' ; so sorry !
which only pissed me off more !
as soon as i pulled around the corner , my vehicle died .
i called aaa and my battery cable was conveniently lose .
i sold them _num_ hard copy books in great condition .

_num_ minutes into my visit , i finally got the correct drink .
for the price , i 've had better bar food .
i canceled my membership because i was over it .
later , i saw him behind the front desk .
my first impression was , the staff cared less about making you feel welcome .
this was a huge disappointment !
he joined _num_ hour fitness the same time i did .
this only half listening behavior continued while i explained my husband 's frustration .
so that had me frustrated .
walked in today _num_ employees literally standing around chatting .
they wasted my time once again .
continued on and on with ridiculous prices .
however , today , the guy behind the desk was rude and condescending .
just had the worst experience at arrowhead dentistry .
literally , left their office in tears .
the hot wing pizza i had was overly greasy and rich .
there was no end in sight .
even my friends that took me here no longer seem like themselves to me .
the wings were ok , but very wet .
he had no napkins , parm cheese or peppers .
the restaurant was empty , by the way .
originally it wasnt a bad place for the price .
my ac unit frequently leaked all over the floor .
neither she or the manager offered any compensation at that time .
was way too much hassle !
this was my second time to this nail salon for a pedicure .
it was so incredibly hot i felt it burn my skin .
even the nail tech next to him said `` too hot !
then they offered me _num_ % of the value of the card .
he lost a patient for $ _num_ , not a very smart doctor .
he then offered me a free oil change .
practically the first words out of the owner were , `` call _num_ . ''
no refill offered this time on drink , no straw either .
they looked very consistent though , canned ?
the hot and sour soup was okay .
it was terrible !
the one nigiri i had was just awful .
the one california type roll was similarly awful .
quickly seated , drinks , and appetizer were great .
it sucked .
this was one of the worst meals ever .
the service was lousy but the food was worse .
bland , uninspired and came cold to boot .
i got a lame excuse for why .
the service was horrible !
however , in this case ... both the food and service were really bad .
they brought my husband root beer instead of coke .
there were _num_ in our party .
this was my first time at a carrabba 's , my husband 's too .
once our food came , the portion size of the entrees was extremely underwhelming .
i went against my better judgement .
chicken brian she said .
so i only ate one of piece of broccoli .
anyways , dropped the car off the next day at the scheduled time .
made an appt for _num_ on a saturday for an oil change .
spoke with joe he was helpful in tire selection .

the portions were tiny and the sushi was , well , fishy .
we were a party of _num_ on a thursday night .
however , the server was pretty friendly and fast .
the good news is that i got my sushi fix .
sushi review : spicy tuna rolls were in no way spicy .
the meal was also very overpriced , especially for the quality of food .
the nigiri were also terribly bland .
sadly , the rolls were small and covered in sauce .
maybe it was just a bad night .
tonight was awful .
there were only two other tables being served .
i went for lunch , the specials were just okay .
there was nothing special about their sushi and the customer service was terrible .
unfortunately , i was very disappointed .
sushi was eh .
the rest of the meal was a disaster .
i 've had great experiences and horrible experiences .
the only positive was chris behind the sushi bar .
felt as though staff rushed us .
it was completely empty .
it was just mediocre .
that was gross .
i said this was fine , i just wanted my money back .
tonight me and some friends went as a group of five .
the service here was horrible !
it was pathetic .
she then told me it was $ _num_ for two iced teas .

the bathroom was nasty .
there was nothing nice about it .
im an avid black friday shopper and _num_ was the most unorganized awful experience .
chicken here or any fresh food for that matter heck no !
finally i just left , what a waste of time and poor customer service .
there was only _num_ checkout lane open !
this was the last item of _num_ items purchased .
it was the only car in the service bay .
was there sunday afternoon and they only had _num_ registers open .
finally opened _num_ more register and it was a mad dash to it .
the lines at this walmart was horrendous .
i visited this location around 9pm on a saturday night .
it really was a long time .
there were _num_ techs who stood around while one guy did everything .
my fault for not making sure i got my _num_ cash back .
said she was too busy .
i was so disappointed with the experience i had .
it burned so bad .
the lady jennifer made me pay $ _num_ for nothing .
the guy who did my mani/pedi was so rough with everything he did !
it was like a slap in the face .
tonight was the final straw .
laughing in my face like something was a joke .
the massage in my legs and feet were horrible .
i paid $ _num_ , light came back on not even 24hrs later .
later the same evening after doing hoover dam , needed a snack .
went here yesterday for lunch .
we got our food , which tasted like cardboard .
the only thing i found okay was the garlic naan .
there were no authentic spices which we use daily in our cooking .
it was like maybe one leg .
the sauce was bland .
instead of cheeseburger samosa , i got a pastry filled samosa .
chicken masala was pretty bland .
yelp you disappointed me tonight .
the shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either .
lastly , the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average .
the place was certainly a hole in the wall .
the folks that work there were super nice .
it was like half a potato all together .
it was sweet and bland .
when we arrived , the restaurant was empty with just one pair dining .
the server was courteous and attentive .
this was so disappointing .
next the lamb curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice .
i had real bad experience at this place .
it was the most horrible experience of my life at a restaurant .
our waiter was overly aggressive .
i waited _num_ minutes for my stylist .
she was very unprofessional , chewing gum the whole time .
it was a disaster .
avoid this place and definitely not worth the $ _num_ i paid for it .
there was a very large selection of seed beads .
stopped in the other day after driving by this place so many times .
there was a guy sitting at a table to the left .
they said it was random testing .
california , and one from st. rose hospital in las vegas .
instead of going after her office , we left .
remember going the cheap way cost twice as much .
the lady that greeted me on the day of our wedding was rude .
the flowers were just _num_ plain red roses and nothing more .
wedding started with very rude staff at this facility .

he just stared at me standing in the cashiers line .
that made no sense to me .
all three of the associates gave a nasty attitude .
the costumer service was bad .
there were other customers waiting for a longer time .
the worst auto zone store ran by bad managers .
they ruined my brand new expensive suit .
i still dont know where he got the price .
he was worse .
_num_ minutes wait while he researched each and every one on the internet .
he said its online for $ _num_ so that 's a deal .
he quoted me $ _num_ _num_ ( each ! )
he was very helpful when we did ask for a certain record .
the last stop i made this year ends it for me .
i wasted an hour of my time there .
the value of the records varied from $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
i was interested in and the owner requested a price that was totally ridiculous .
i owned record stores until _num_ when i sold my last store .
they also raised our rent without telling us !
one server that served our area and a single chef for a weekend night ?

only four side dishes came , tasted so so .
we ordered short ribs , brisket , bulgogi , pork belly , and chicken .
the pork had over _num_ pound of pure fat in it .
rice was ok .
doors locked , no furniture inside .
this happened about _num_ to _num_ times in total .

to credit , the food was hot and obviously freshly cooked .
no problems he said .

my friend and i went there for karaoke on a friday night .
the teriyaki sandwich was really just a burnt cheeseburger with nothing on it .
everything we ate was either too salty or no salt .

never met with anyone at any location .
the woman rubbed the same places on my body strangely .
then she demanded a tip .
left without ordering anything .
there was _num_ waitress serving the booths .

kevin was rude and unprofessional .
he took no ownership of his shoddy work .
i asked him if a _num_ dress was worth losing _num_ client 's business .
i went out of my way because of the reviews on yelp .

they did just that , however .
he also got foot & mouth disease from one of the little dirty kids .

the quality of the fish seemed worse than red lobster .

two people in my party got sick from the oysters .
ordered the surf & turf , which is the filet and lobster .
bingo isnt half bad either .

another thing that i found disappointing was the small portion size for hibachi .
this was my least favorite experience at nakama .
my son ordered shrimp hibachi i ordered chicken fried rice .
she was rude and ignorant !

the food ... was ... boring .
the wine was bland .
the amount of salt on these things was ridiculous .
the pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat .
five seconds later the wings were there .
this was our 1st stop .
overall , the place was a typical dive bar , nothing special about it .
we had a miserable experience tonight at club cafe .
however , the menu was so sticky and disgusting that we just left .
the only reason i gave this place two stars is because of the smoking .

the breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated .
there was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug .
i got the chicken parm over pasta .
the chicken crust was crispy , sauce was good but nothing special .
when we got our coffees we realized we had no spoons and no sugar .
my god , the cakes were delicious .
that being said , the atmosphere is awesome as is the store .
the dessert , like cakes , was just too sweet and heavy ... .
however the rest of my experience was kind of frustrating .
the food was mediocre .
the pancakes that my sister ordered tasted like pure baking powder .
over all this place had a chaotic vibe to it .
i then requested barbeque .
i also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there .

_num_ hours later i realized the ring felt uncomfortable on my finger .
