i was sadly mistaken .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
this place has none of them .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .

it was a basic salad , no big deal .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
in a considerably nasty tone .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .

no more smoking allowed .
i really really want this place to do better .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the corn lacked butter .

they did not acknowledge me .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
do n't take your cat here .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
there was no one filling up water .
they did n't remake anything .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
does that make you a little worried ?
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .

why the hell was there a wait ?
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the total was $ _num_ and change .

the worst dental office i ever been .

i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .

not at this location .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
but the food came cold .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .

the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .

this place has gone significantly down hill .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
she sent it back .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
bar staff not so much this visit .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
i could barely eat the salad .
the food was absolutely gross !

the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .

i was just really turned off from that experience .
i will not be back again to eat .
the fish itself was bland .
sometime you just get one that is n't .

i will never spend money here again !
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
first off , service was horrible .
was so salty and just not good .
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
huge fail for this type of venue .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .

everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .

they did n't even get their drinks .
the food was bad .

but that 's not the worst .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
i wish there were no kids .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
the food was n't very good at all .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
- none of the food was super awesome .
the low point lately has been the food .
it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the food is pretty forgettable .
here 's where i ran into problems .
it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
poor service and food .
on to the important part ... food was terrible .
i had a burger and it was pathetic .
otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
it was like having a standard old boring burger .
i was very disappointed .
the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
over all this meal was a wash .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i could not even finish half of mine .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
everything else , avoid .
first bad experience at this place .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
wo n't visit again .
i wo n't be going back .
very disappointed with this place .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
it was so underwhelming .
slow service , horrible , horrible food .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
it 's not that hard .
the food , however , is mediocre at best .
i could not see a thing .
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
it was n't edible .
but damn , i was hungry !
the service did n't get any better .
the food was lousy .
but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
that 's where the praise ends .
they 're banking on this lack of competition .
now , maybe you do n't care .
walmart does n't even make you do that !
this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
all in all this place is n't that bad .
drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .
bar louie : you are dead to me .
i ca n't say the food is bad .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
i wo n't be going back .
to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
there were also plenty of empty tables .
the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
our server , was friendly .
both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .
not even a large one , either !
but good lord , they 're just so loud !
not cool , bar louie .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
the service is ok but rather slow .
this is not one of them .
worst bar i have ever been to .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
no offer to refill drinks or for water .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
small flies flying around restaurant .
i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .
he pushed me and took all the chairs .
an adult area would change all this .
the weekdays are bad enough .
the lazy river could be much better .
dont waste your time with this place .
you 're better off with a garden hose .
just sad there customer service sucks .
i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
people are rude there as well .
some horse play and such .
i really hate this place .
please do n't eat this food .

no repeat visit for me .
general tso had no flavor .
only reason i would go back is speed .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
even the water tasted weird .

why was my beer warm ?
i did not find this funny at all !
it was ok ... very mediocre .
i really never want to return .
but later the service was not all good .
was very disappointed with the food .
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
service was just barely adequate on this visit .
it sure is n't the food .
only in a pinch .
i managed one bite and was done .
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
i saw no reason to continue .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
this food , though , it was n't good .
after _num_ minutes we gave up .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
the service was annoying .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
but it 's soooooo bland !
i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
nothing was comped and no manager was available .
this pf changs needs new management !
it 's not worth the headache .
drinks were not good .
below par on every way .
did n't say a word to us .
will not be back there -- rude hostess !
it 's fake asian food .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
never going back to pf changs .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .
not going to recommend it to anyone .

the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
it was bitter cold outside .
i quickly ate and left to make my movie .
i 'm not against p.f .

its not very good at all .
service here is pretty bad .
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
very disappointing considering their pricing structure .
do not eat the pastries !
she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
service here has gone considerably downhill .
i just felt i was rushed out of there .
am i the only one ?
my experience here was not great at all .
white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
first of all , the store was messy .
i did n't get it .
continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
it 's not that delish .
this store has such bad service .
the service staff are rude rude rude .
save your money , shop elsewhere .
maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
the service was very slow .
my drink was never refilled .
the breakfast bar is lame .
it 's a hit and miss .
this location though has horribly slow service .
does n't matter what time we go .

i walked in and was ignored .
possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
i will never go back to that place again .
the waitress there are extremely rude .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
much closer to bland than anything .
no offer of water , or a drink .

this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .
sorry but not going back there again .
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .

i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
penne was mediocre at best .
never did get a refill on iced tea .
sorry to see this place go down hill .

my silver was even wrapped in torn linens !
even the staff is miserable anymore .
i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .
there were five very small shrimp on the plate .
the shrimp were dry and overcooked .
the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .
i will not go back .
her reply `` no .
this is simply a customer service review .
_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .
not even a ceiling fan in sight .
a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .
we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .
very bad purchase experience .
this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .
not surprisingly , we left without purchasing anything .
convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .
and i quickly remembered why !
we all know it 's not great .
the owner has to be the problem .
worst mcdonald 's ever .
_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
also they do not take credit or debit cards .
there are better options .
sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .
sorry just had my first taste of pierogies plus .
the potatoes tasted very bland almost like dried mixed .
not my cut of tea .
unfortunately the food was n't very good .
it was around 2:30 and empty .
not a lot of fat on them .
menu is very basic .
the patty was sorta flavorful .
the toppings were in the bland category .
management there does n't care !
visit another club , this one is n't it !
avoid at all costs .
arrangement was just ok .
i will not order from this place again .
i would give our experience zero stars .
whatever it was , it was gross .
the chicken nuggets come out under par .

worst fast food i 've ever been to .
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
he cried constantly when i left his sight .
also , do not take their facebook page seriously .
they do not care about animals .
they do not care about animals , at all .
this vet is only out for the money .
an average price , i 'm ok with that .
i could n't believe it .
i will not return to this place again .
it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
overall , this made a horrible day worse .
this store sucks beyond belief !
first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
do n't waste your time or money !
i handed it to her and walked out .
not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
we will not be back .
the new dentist could n't believe that !
do not go here -- find another dentist .
it was a weird experience .
i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .
do not take your dog there to be groomed !
at our table and then left prior to ordering .
she told me it would be awhile .
long waits and lack of attentiveness .
not sure pino 's will get a repeat visit .
bland food and poor service .
there were no open tables , despite having reservations .
$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?
i probably will not return .
the worst part of the night ?
needless to say , we were disappointed .
the place has changed and not for the better .
sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment !
all of it was overpriced and below mediocre .
salad was average at best .
i wo n't be going back .
after _num_ minutes , i left .
the set up is ridiculous .
at night it is a nightmare .
walked out without making purchase .
it was like a window into hell .
i will never step foot in that store again .
some are very slow .
the customers do n't make the experience any better .
employees are unhelpful and rude .
_num_ minutes later , we were done .
the cut was terrible !
i have an awful experience .
the eggplant was soggy and not great .
price : tasty is cheap .
atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .
would i go back again ?
i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .
sadly , they prepared kung pao beef instead .
it 's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food .
not tasty at all .
the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .
there 's $ _num_ down the drain .
first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
the entire bag was a soggy mess .
it tasted and looked like rice .
holy bat balls did this place have bad food !
nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .
very kind , gave me minor changes without question .
zero flavor , zero filling , frozen wan tons ?
they most certainly sat in broth for hours .
i could n't even pick them up .
watery sauce , no heat .
the worst part of it all .
it was just inedible .
all noodle , no filler .
avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .
unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
the service was slow and lukewarm .
also , no credit or debit cards here .
the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .
it was n't very hot either .
i am definitely going elsewhere next time .
they lost my breakfast business that day .
tasted like sauce and cheese on toast .
not the crusty italian bread .
no dipping oil with herbs and spices .
it was _num_ % breading .
i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini .
again , no herbs and spices .
i could n't even taste garlic in it .
what kind of italian food has no garlic ?
$ _num_ , including tip .
this shell station is horrible .
_num_ ) this place is ghetto .
zero effort , and a horrible attitude .
do not use their car wash .
this was a big mistake .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
called two days later to confirm it was ready .
`` no , it 's not ready yet .
days passed and no call .
no `` i 'm sorry . ''
this is a terrible shelter .
that 's probably how they got so sick !
my poor baby went through hell .
never again will i take my dog there .
she was sick six ways to sunday .
i hate that place and everyone in it .
i 'm very disappointed .
so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .
so beware , you are paying to dollar !
my suit coat came back ruined !
it makes no sense .
i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .
let me repeat , never again .
however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .
this place is a disaster .
-they did not install tires correctly .
booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
i do not recommend .
last time i ever set foot in that place .
i will not be returning in the future .
no appointments available for tomorrow .
this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .
something does n't sound right here .
the people who work here are very rude .
i will not go back again .
a little pricey but whatever .
the sandwich was just gross .
the coffee was just a little off .
no wonder mine was stale .
seriously , fuck this place .
our server was friendly , but not terribly attentive .
the sandwich left something to be desired .
buffalo blues was neither .
not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
very classy , wish i could remember her name .
bar food none too exceptional .
we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .
food is really , really average .
it 's loud as hell !
want to sit in the bar area ?
also it 's loud as hell !
to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
it is way too expensive .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
food is very overpriced though .
and , its not good .
such a waste of time .
i hate this place .
so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .
the wings do not come with celery .
apparently this was a bad choice .
the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar .
we will not be back .
the food was awful , the service worse .
and the quality of them are bad .
unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .
the hot and sour soup was ok.
this is an average chinese buffet .
and it all is so bad .
i came in with a flat .
so no , no thank you .
they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .
guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .
but after what happened i will never be back .
they just cost me money and lost my tires .
put the tires in my basement , no problem .
i do n't know how this keeps happening .
too bad after all these prior good reviews .
extremely rude and condescending over the phone .
the sad part about this is they really try .
my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
and nobody smiled at anyone else .
_num_ weeks later , no title ?
naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
and again naturally , no return phone call .
if i could give negative stars i would .
times , and it still is not resolved .
if i could give negative stars i would .
times , and it still is not resolved .
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .
complete waste of life .
so the air in tire was wasted time .
no one has gotten back to me yet .
place was a little bit of a disaster .
i came away with none of it .
very disappointing to me .
the customer service at this location is terrible .
overall , shopping there is a poor experience .
i really like this shop .
all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
they do not take pride in their work .
they also lose things , more than once .
as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
additionally , they did not smell so well .
the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
avoid at all costs !
they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !
very rude and condescending .
do not take your car to midas !
they place no value on customer satisfaction .
he said no because we didnt discuss it .
refused all of those .
seriously just do n't do it .
slow service and response .
linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .
worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .
i felt sick before i got halfway through it .
but their pizza was remarkably terrible .
i pay my $ _num_ and wait .
i could n't stand to eat more than half .
i 'm not making this up .
gross , gross , gross .
the crust was hard and flavorless .
this was a mistake .
avoid this place at all costs .
how utterly disgusted i was with it .
i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .
and at least i put my cart back .
now it 's just more expensive .
worst parking lot in pittsburgh .
try $ _num_ , for real .
waste of time and money overall .
parking at this particular store is a nightmare .
you may even get a nasty look , yikes !
do not bring your car here .
sunday went by then monday went by .
this was not in the lease .
they never reached out to me , not once !
i would caution against this rental company .
that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .
wish me luck guys .
ridiculous policies and move out fees .
the management is horrible and never understanding .
cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags !
the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
i would give him a _num_ start rating .
have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?
the wine list did not include descriptions .
the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .
there was no information about this .
food is mediocre at best !
they even screwed my order .
would not recommend to anyone .
i do n't get it .
more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
total waste of $ _num_ bucks .
also , their bar seating sucks .
i ca n't believe all the high reviews .
the food tasted terrible .
we were disappointed with our entrees .
not a good vegan experience .
i again had offended by my request .
overpriced , salty and overrated !
- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
that was n't to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
i would hate to lose this place !
not worth the price .
main dish : long island duck - too salty .
the service was also extremely slow .
wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .
i never felt so ripped off .
- this really was the standout .
anyway , i 'm never going back here .
i really , really wanted to like this restaurant .
maybe part of the problem was expectations ?
learn from my mistake .
it 's never too loud or aggressive .
the food is inconsistent , but often good .
their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .
owners , please stick to your business hours .
it just was n't anything special .
it tasted like nothing .
anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
also they do n't really wash their cups .
good idea , but poorly executed food .
worst tofu scramble ever .
days old , cold , hard , inedible .
sorry storm , you need to improve this .
but do n't expect that feeling here .
two stars because i really like the drinks here .
this place is a train wreck .
the food is bland .
the service was pretty bad .
i think pittsburgh deserves better .
if not , stay away .
do n't waste your money !
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
overall , i would n't go back .
probably not ordering from here again .
also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !
we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !
and they are rude .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
she seemed tired , and overworked .
all in all , this was a negative experience .
imho that 's ridiculous .
i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .
thanks , but no thanks .
however , i recently missed an appointment .
ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .
normally , i have had the best experiences there .
not anything like the pieces on the floor .
just thought you should know .
worst customer service i 've seen in a while .
worst climbing gym i have ever been to .
customer service was a joke .
first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
the staff was n't very helpful .
it 's poor form .
i would n't go there again .
the lamb burger was also overcooked .
very pricey food , cash only , average food .
these people could not care less .
rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .
it was n't the cut .
_num_ years i had this deal going on .
i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .
receptionists were beyond awful .
no wonder they need coupons for customers .
big waste of time and gas .
wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?
this place is n't very good .
wo n't be going back .
a good family dollar this is not !
and they smoke around the food .
water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !
ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .
i wo n't be back .
service is incredibly slow .
not worth it at all .
i had a horrible experience .
this time , overpriced food and bad service .
this is a bad neighborhood .
i am not interested in ever going back !
not happy about the new staff .
the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .
the disappointment was it was over-cooked .
not a spot of pink to be found .
i am definitely not going to the place again .
everything else was yucky .
i was totally underwhelmed .
this place does n't feel clean or inviting .
the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
i will not be returning again .
they are n't very friendly there at all either .
not a bad place to get your nails done .
too over priced for mani and pedi .
the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .
then when i got it , it was cold !
there were no other veggies or anything .
it was all mushy breading and very little chicken .
i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .
i wo n't be getting one again .
the pizza was bland , tasteless .
crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .
i wo n't be back .
i was absolutely horrified !
do not go here for service on your bike .
maybe i just had a bad day .
this is not even worthy of the name .
there was no third bite .
the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .
zero if that was an opinion .
not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''
needless to say we will never go there again .
would n't recommend at all .
the quality was horrible .
the sauce was not a good flavor at all .
the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned .
and the prices too high .
biggest waste of money !
i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .
disgusting is putting it lightly .
i threw the whole meal in the garbage .
it 's a shame , what happened ?
that is completely ridiculous .
one star for the ridiculous overcharge .
it was not good .
for dinner , not that great .
they can keep the other groupon .
the owner is very pretentious and rude .
i am never going back to this place .
unfortunately , this is the only game in town .
makes me glad i live in new york city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
one week later i call , not ready .
the following week , they would call me back .
service and products are lackluster .
overall , not a great choice .
actually that is n't quite accurate .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
the food is n't fresh .
it was n't pan fried either .
that 's total bullshit .
food was mediocre at best .
bland is the best description .
wo n't be back .
sadly , i just did n't like it .
what i was into was the german potato salad .
i was highly disappointed .
i really want to like this place .
reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
for starters , the food is always served cold .
do n't believe me ?
yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .
you need a new chef , immediately .
beware of the ketchup .
not even the potato pancakes tasted good .
not a fan of this `` german '' place .
very low quality food for the price .
avoid at all cost .
potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
it should n't be this way .
everything else was sub-par .
the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .
about _num_ % more expensive .
just bad service overall .
no one to help with bags morning or night .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i would n't stay here again .
i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .
very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .
do not believe he cares about his patients .
horrible food , horrible service .
the pizza was n't that good either .
i will not get anything from there again .
ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
was going to try the buffalo pizza .
no longer going to try .
and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .
i got food poisoning and was so sick .
needless to say i refused to pay for them .
at this point , i am done .
its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .
so dissapointed and will never use them again .
this week is the 3rd week .
pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
do n't bother with delivery here .
this is the worst location .
food is ok but horrible delivery service .
small , overcrowded , unfriendly staff .
but it was nothing special .
prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
never again , they are off my list .
do not go to this restaurant !
their food was mediocre at best .
i will not be going back .
went for the first and last time tonight .
$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
the food was less than average .
they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
but this was quickly corrected .
i give them a _num_ for presentation .
but did nothing to make up for it .
the worst thing about this place is also sam .
does not honor national sub day offer .
too late to back out .
worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
the store never looks very clean .
such a shame about this place .
the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .
i dont even bother coming here anymore .
i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .
owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .
the worst customer service ever !
i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .
i hope the owner or general manager reads this .
service is mediocre and slow .
waitress was ok in attitude .
that 's _num_ minutes to be next .
the service is terrible .
this was ridiculous to us so we left !
ugh , i hate this place .
the service is snotty and slow .
the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .
i tried the seared ahi tuna .
but do n't go for the menu .
it is n't a bad experience .
maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
crab fries , naturally .
was n't the best either .
service , small selection and mediocre food .
not a degree above room temp .
my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .
first of all , our service was awful .
i was meeting up with _num_ other people there .
i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .
it took over _num_ minutes to get the order .
awful place , to bad i was looking forward .
not even one piece .
service was slow for soup and a salad .
was n't very busy which was a plus .
service is terrible and wo n't return .
i was mostly wrong .
unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .
it is difficult to get under my skin .
that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
we will not be back .
we feel like our money was wasted .
the only downfall was their delivery time .
i tried pickles tonight for the first time .
it was another _num_ before i got my food .
i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
first of all , ordering was strange .
wow ... we 're we disappointed .
do n't do it !
they do n't take debit or credit cards .
so not cool steelers !
it made me kind of sad .
o my pittsburgh pirates .
which is pretty sad .
was so excited to get your pizza today .
very disappointed in the quality of what i got .
how sad is this so not happy .
used to be the best i 've ever had .
wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
there are other better pizza places in the area .
it was just as lousy as the lunch .
unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .
the place smells of smoke .
walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .
do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
both tasted very fishy to me .
mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .
the place is dated and could use updating .
her first bite she made a sour face .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
no , just no .
they told a driver must have taken by accident .
both were crappy , at best .
staff was really rude both times .
it 's a shame .
$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
also , alcohol in the air here too .
i would never use them again .
ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .
the staff completely ignored it .
this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .
it just left a bad taste in my mouth .
had a friend who went here .
the owner is the one who took my appointment .
they are a hot mess .
i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
i was really disappointed .
what a terrible experience .
i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .
disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .
that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
the owner refuses to take care of black people .
i had an ugly haircut .
for $ _num_ with the owner .
this time around i am extremely upset .
i very much regret ever trying this salon .
what a complete waste of time .
avocado is like banana .
needless to say , we skipped dessert .
i was not impressed with the sushi either .
i would not recommend this place .
always seem to be people going in and out .
the moo shu pork was forgettable .
everything else we had sucked .
shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .
the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
i probably wo n't order here again though .
this place has ok food and bad customer service .
a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .
meaning , i never saw her full face .
or maybe i 'm wrong .
the answer , so bad !
only once was it under par .
how about horrible customer service ?
thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !
i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .
pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .
the room continued to be unimpressive .
- no visible signs of bed bugs .
it 's dirty and weird .
the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .
( old cereal and bread . )
the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .
i do n't get this place .
sorry , but our pizza was cold .
and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .
my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
the dining room is also a bit cramped .
this was just bad pizza .
also the mushrooms were out of a can .
do not waste money here .
but i do n't get it .
way too much cheese .
the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .
it is definitely not for me .
i do n't get it .
cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?
_num_ cents per slice for every topping ?
whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .
worse than store freezer pizza .
, i would have never known .
did n't live up to my expectations at all .
waste of time and money .
it does n't work .
man was this place packed !
however it just does not work for me .
if i could rate it zero stars i would .
they put way too much cheese on everything .
stay away unless you 're just buying tires !
very disappointed with this dry cleaner .
i do n't normally get my beer from there .
small dark not very opening or friendly place .
will not be returning .
the only good thing was free parking out back .
had n't even read the reviews beforehand .
mediocre and poorly made !
do n't waste your time .
i would never give these people my money again .
this is by far not true in this store .
the service is rather incompetent .
it would have been nice to know whom .
ca n't understand the big secret about that one .
this was done _num_ years ago .
nothing more , and nothing less .
we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .
atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .
poor service , crappy food .
overall not the way a restaurant should be run .
do not order steak or prime rib here .
the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .
then , she sat _num_ small parties there .
this place is a bad idea all around .
very disappointed in this place .
we are never going back .
this place is sad .
not fresh at all .
also did n't seem very nice .
very annoyed and ignorant !
this place is empty ... .
and _num_ bbq dishes .
not hot at all ... .
server kim was awesome .
but kitchen has a lot of problems .
i 'm sure it would have been great !
i am not exaggerating in the least .
anything dealing with food is a train wreck .
you 've been warned !
if i could less than a star i would .
service was extremely slow to begin with .
go figure cooked , but cold .
it 's also really expensive .
it 's not worth the money .
it was a place where everybody knew my name .
i can not speak for others .
will never go back !
pancakes were not very good .
very small and uncomfortable .
dont fall for it .
especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .
such a waste of time .
no hint of a smile on her face .
are we really hungry or really impatient ?
maybe the waitress was having a bad day .
i do not get the hype behind this place .
i wo n't be back .
i would n't go back .
urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
this pizza is not good .
i would n't order a pizza from them again .
now it 's just crap .
not a dime every again .
so he ca n't bother with mine .
i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .
it all could have been so easily avoided .
it does n't feel fair .
i am not impressed .
mediocre food service and atmosphere .
obviously that feeling is long gone .
oily , greasy and bad taste .
the old woman was not nice .
for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
so , i will never be back .
which is sad , really .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
all tasted like old food .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
needless to say , we will never return !
i ordered chicken curry .
this place is pretty bad .
the food is n't fresh .
_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
sadly really went downhill .
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
everything is basic with a large price tag .
rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .
there were _num_ of us .
it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .
however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .
very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .
the wedding soup was less than fair .
the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .
it was a disgrace .
could n't remember anything .
husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
it was runny and bland .
would not go back .
the fries were ways very soggy and cold .
i want so badly to like this place !
horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?
spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?
noise level -- painful ?
all in all , very disappointing in our book .
delivery guy was shady too .
i do n't like this place at all .
i do n't recommend at all .
no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
however once opened not so much .
there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .
are you kidding me ?
* no shopping carts .
now , their service : really lackluster .
the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
hardly saw any of that today .
fries are nothing special .
the worst part , though , is the service .
and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .
not a good value in my book .
probably wo n't be back .
check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .
are you kidding me ?
the size that i ordered required zero alterations .
she was sooooo rude .
but it was not the dress she ordered .
no time to get additional fabric .
this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .
worst dry cleaners ever .
i wo n't be coming here again .
these people are totally incompetent .
unfortunately zero stars is not an option .
shame on you cathy !
it is my worst fear .
and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .
what i got was dry and totally tasteless .
the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
again no salt or seasoning .
so why my low score ?
food was average , service very bad .
they do n't use their space well .
it just looked really sparse .
this is a depressing coffee shop .
tables are often dirty .
no additional fans , nothing .
i asked for my money back .
you know what was the worst thing , though ?
well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?
does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
yeah , i 'm not coming here anymore .
_num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .
_num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
this place has gone downhill tremendously .
pizza was fine but nothing special .
the salad i ordered was wrong , though .
i will never step foot in this place again .
i really do n't get giant eagle .
i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .
six days and it cost _num_ dollars .
not even remotely convenient .
nothing special , it is kmart after all .
are employees required to be grumpy here ?
they all look like they hate their job .
the managers do n't care .
worst applebee 's experience i 've had .
no apologies when we were finally taken care of .
should have listened to my gut on this one .
but i did n't have a problem with that .
another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !
i said no thanks .
takeout is a mess at this location .
very awkward location and atmosphere .
i hate complaining like this .
there are better hibachi options in the area .
the service can be okay or awful .
it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .
i do n't know how people keep coming here .
benihana is not worth your time or money .
by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .
this is totally unacceptable .
the restaurant was n't even half full .
our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible !
none of us even like onions .
we feel completely cheated .
since the changes its just awful .
w h at a shame .
i just hate to see it .
extremely disappointed , food was absolutely awful .
our chicken was flavorless and rubbery .
no explanation , no apology , nothing .
the presentation of the food was awful .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
this is the worst hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh .
the food was cold and everything was flavorless .
the salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner .
the chicken was also extremely dry .
it was really disappointing .
the place was completely empty .
he should n't have been put in that position .
shame on you benihana .
dirty place and horrible service .
loud is an understatement .
what we got at long last was so disappointing .
even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .
even the guacamole was too hot .
the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us .
the food was also not too good .
i will not be coming back .
the food is n't terrible , but not impressive .
the food was okay , but worst service ever .
both were very dry and lacked flavor .
worst margarita i have ever been served !
did n't even get time under the warmer .
service was mediocre but the food was poor .
burnt chicken in the burrito .
this was explained to us before we ordered .
never again mad mex south hills !
not worth the trip .
i am a ten minute drive from this location .
i attended the sushi class on monday night .
can you give a company zero stars ?
this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb .
not laid out well .
self check out usually broken .
horrible experience more than once .
store is too small and always crowded .
managers and workers are rude and condescending .
had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .
was n't the best experience .
the food was ok but nothing to great .
not up to it 's previous brunch standards .
i wish i could give this no stars !
this place was not packed .
while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .
does n't anyone come and check this ?
came back and dropped them off and left again .
your menu is n't that big !
i did n't even eat all of it .
the fries are very salty .
high prices , horrible service !
i only went here because i had a groupon .
off to sams ... .
i will be doing business elsewhere .
guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .
i threw my mean in the garbage .
this wendy 's is terrible .
there 's nothing fast about this fast food .
at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .
- and they left me hanging .
received bad service today .
we left einstein 's because it was crowded .
they missed an opportunity to impress a new customer .
i usually do not like posting negative reviews .
their service is terrible .
i was ; however , charged for the basket .
the food was cooked well , but lackluster .
have mixed vincent 's .
overpriced , very slow service , food was decent .
food is mediocre service is lousy .
i was disappointed with the seafood salad .
we could n't eat it .
my hoagie was dry with min meat .
probably wont go back .
pizza was good but really expensive .
breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .
the breadsticks were sitting a in pool of oil .
it was n't fresh at all .
and there are n't as many rest stops .
surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .
kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .
that 's not an eatery either .
dead malls are sad , for some reason .
walking through this mall just creepy though .
truly the worst mall in america .
man , the rent has to be so cheap !
honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
stay away , there 's nothing here to see .
this mall is dead !
i hate olive garden .
i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .
avoid at all costs !
thats as american as fortune cookies .
i just passed six tables empty and clean .
very unprofessional staff so far .
rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
i only stayed one night and was charged twice .
add on : the wifi is awful .
no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .
something just feels wrong .
place is ok but a little uncomfortable .
the continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster .
so this spot is like mad cheap but really ?
checkin was seamless as it should be .
i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off .
there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .
i was so mad .
the hallway looks a wreck !
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .
the lights were broken and the room was filthy .
do not stay here .
wish i could give this place negative stars .
it has n't been cleaned in months .
i got home and no extra sides .
i would be happy to get my _num_ back .
mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .
my advice , avoid this place .
junk worse than mcdonald .
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
store is open until 2:00 .
she asks employee to scale back .
never again will i go to this location .
which i do n't really need .
today i gave them _num_ chance .
for real , wasting money for wrong order !
horrible service and food .
it 's not hard .
extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .
the baristas are not friendly .
and they 're just rude .
not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .
it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !
the worst mani/pedi of my life .
did n't know how to remove gel polish .
did n't file straight or smooth .
did n't clean under my nails after lotion .
unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .
unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?
i 'm no longer going back .
first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
i was thinking this place might be like that .
i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
that 's not how it 's done in philly .
woman takes off my toe nail polish .
shady and terribly run nail salon .
surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
this place needs to be closed - stay away !
i really was sold at one point .
i 'm not a hair stylist .
different people wash and dry your hair .
finally , overall the prices were way too high .
one did n't even look up from the computer .
will not return to this place .
once again , they were not prompt .
please do not patronize this business .
i wish it was n't that difficult .
the salon itself also disappointed me .
such a waste of time and rude .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
it looked like a child had done it .
very limited color selection .
very poor quality work .
pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .
it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
do not waste your money .
this is not the first time either .
stuck in my lease until february .
the blackened chicken wrap was boring .
ca n't win 'em all , right ?
other times , it does n't seem so busy .
finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
he said the stir fry was so-so .
it was just so-so .
my food was plain and boring .
the place was noisy and it was pricey .
very bad food and overpriced .
i wish i could give this place no stars !
no tip for you my friend .
especially considering the french dip was so boring .
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
i did not , however get the best .
the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
food was flavorless , plain .
do they even have tables for _num_ ?
will not be back .
pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
they do not have 1/2 price apps !
somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .
$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .
the lobster bisque was bland and cold .
the pork chop was so bitter and dry .
unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .
our food tasted frozen and overcooked .
what has not changed is the extremely poor service .
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
all working hard , but covering too many tables .
long story short , i wo n't go back .
she thought the potato side was just so-so .
hotel restaurants are just awful !
for starters , the place is sorely outdated .
the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .
the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .
but it was not happening at this place !
and def not as good !
it was hardly halfway full .
needless to say , i will not be back .
do n't say i did n't warn you !
the portions are not worth the price .
the salads are small and nothing to write about .
do n't waste your time at the fish market .
_num_ dollars for _num_ people .
it all had no taste !
the steak was tough and tasteless .
service was the only redeeming quality .
unfortunately we did not .
the food was all bland and tasteless .
it was not even blackened .
a round of patron margaritas were horrible .
the food was awful .
do not waste your money at this restaurant .
just all around terrible .
both were not unique in flavor or presentation .
i was pretty disappointed by this experience .
it was n't good at all .
so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .
but the quality just does n't match the price .
no worries probably better for me .
two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
yes , but only if it is convenient .
shame , the fish was good there .
crappy hostess for sure .
it does n't change much .
the miso soup was barely average .
the rest was dry .
she however did not offer to comp the meal .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
the food on the other hand - absolutely horrible .
so disappointed with this place !
the drinks were n't anything special either .
not my scene whatsoever !
super bad energy in this place .
the night was not lost .
it 's definitely gone downhill .
there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
but the attitude of this place could be better .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
wo n't come again to this place ... .
it was boring and flavor free .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
ok , i 'm in !
well hell , what was your first guess ?
when it did , it looked ok .
it was very disappointing .
in fact , i could n't finish it .
my biggest complaint is the drink prices .
seriously , avoid this place .
unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
there was also no pineapple chutney .
overall , very disappointed .
but the positives stop there .
neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
completely bitter and disgusting !
my first impression was the outdated decor .
the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
the food was mediocre .
can you say awkward ?
this time was not so good .
no problem , we were seated right away .
anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .
not a fan of the service .
it literally killed me to leave a tip .
the food was underwhelming at best .
no acknowledgement when we arrive .
asked to leave my card at the bar .
never came out to see how we were doing .
worst service i 've received in a while .
the sauce was disappointing .
i would n't come here for anything .
avoid this tourist trap !
first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
why does n't the schedule know this ?
there 's no day pass .
getting on and off is confusing .
when to pay is confusing .
the service is n't frequent enough .
the buses smell like urine .
sucks , sucks , sucks .
not the drivers fault .
buses are late all the time .
they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .
pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !
the bus number is _num_ .
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .
* wasting over an hour of my time .
big league cities need big league transportation .
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
_num_ fights broke out while we were there .
i signed all paper work and returned the keys .
i became very angry .
worst customer service at this place .
no grace period or understanding at all .
she was as useless as a tsa agent .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i probably wo n't be back ever again .
i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .
unfortunately , this place is pretty dirty .
make sure no flies land on your food .
unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
worst sandwich on earth .
oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
it was really , really , not good .
service was indifferent , at best .
i was not impressed with my sandwich there .
rude , arrogant , and just nasty .
i do n't like coleslaw .
the sandwich at best was mediocre .
2nd experience , today , equally as awful .
their fries are also soggy and gross .
the concept is n't that ridiculous either .
the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
half the sandwich falls out while your eating .
ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
i only go there when dragged by coworkers .
lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .
i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
she just disappeared again .
until then she was just missing .
i was really annoyed .
it was all french fries and very little meat .
so , why such a low score ?
the service was terrible .
utterly , totally unbelievable .
the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
nope , wo n't be back .
disappointed , big time .
tonight was my second attempt here .
not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .
no more tries here .
but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .
it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .
i stand by my decision : pass .
can i give this place zero stars ?
waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
it , however , did n't work for me .
it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
i ca n't hold it against them though .
this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .
will never return to any location !
highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
it was just strange .
basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
ok , i get it , your busy .
nothing to write home about .
i do n't care for primanti brothers .
my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .
i do not recommend this place .
that being said , this place was not good .
firstly , the food had no flavor .
that has nothing to do with our party size .
we 'd probably never go back .
i do n't understand the hype with this place .
the sandwiches they serve are gross !
the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
way too much coleslaw .
too many fries on the sandwich .
i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
i would n't recommend this place .
the burger is dry and lacks flavor .
the bread was the worst part .
it 's just bad .
the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .
the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .
and the wait staff were awesome .
also , parking was shit .
this place really did suck .
for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
i dread it at this point .
for one , the service was terrible .
you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
and their beer selection sucks .
there is very little meat on the sandwich .
service is n't that great either .
for all the hype this was very disappointing .
not a fan of the french bread .
wo n't be coming back after this visit .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
the waiter was not nice at all !
the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .
this mcdonalds is straight crap .
the staff does n't seem to care .
i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
i wo n't be going back .
i have been there _num_ times .
food ok but service ... ... horrible !
this makes me sad to write this .
did they bite off more than they can chew ?
check the expiration dates on all purchase from here !
omg what a nightmare .
it was n't a memorable meal or experience .
i 'm not a fan of that .
the staff is rude .
the prices are too high for the quality .
just all around disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
horrible service and horrible food !
i could n't even taste the crab !
a complete waste of $ _num_ .
my husband and i went tonight for dinner .
worst meal we 've ever had .

the seafood tasted old .
the bathrooms were gross and probably never clean .

not worth wasting your time .
service was just awful .

i will give them hell . ''
brick oven pizza cold ... .
steak was way over cooked .
was not busy but waitress was hard to find .
friends warned me not to eat here .
this was just awful , start to finish .
and a generally miserable experience .
are you kidding me ?
that 's not a lobster roll !
and trying to get our check ?
i wo n't be back .
tried thin man , closed .
the waitress was rude and less than helpful .
diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .
diner _num_ - steamed clams .
why the need to put lobster in a dye ?
sent the mussels back .
rest rooms are dirty , and smell of urine .
you have been warned ... stay away !
if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .

they were cold but did not taste fresh .
the slaw was reasonably good and cold .
i would be hard pressed to ever return .

super disappointed in this place .
when the food arrived it was mediocre at best .

life is too short for less than mediocre food .
absolutely a waste of time and money .
service is just terrible .
the food was terrible and way overpriced .
the restaurant was too busy .
the bathrooms were atrocious .
it 's never horrible .
has n't made me sick , again .

my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
no soup for me apparently .
the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible .
i got the lobster roll and was really disappointed .
did n't even offer a food menu .
the food was bland at best .
alas , the bisque tasted like wheat paste .
maybe i just ate the box ?
it was n't even crowded .
it took _num_ minutes just to get our waters .
the food , however , was disappointing .
that , for me , ruined my whole meal .
my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .
she walked up the stairs and ignored us .
wait , ceasar salad was ok !
anyone who had french fries said they were cold .
for a $ _num_ meal each , not great .

my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .
the only way to describe the food is disgusting .
-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .

sarcastic bartender and place half empty .
the crab cakes were cold and overly salty .
what a horrible experience .
thankfully , our later stops were much better .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
but this place was just awful .
poor excuse for a gentleman 's store .
oh , and its very very expensive !
dark roasted , bitter , etc .
what i received was a whole milk latte .
she said `` fine '' ( rude ) .
but this is n't what i ordered .
and am not a fan of the _num_ % .
that was not a real latte .
unfortunately , mike & tony 's closes by 6pm .
cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .
the gyro itself was mediocre .
i kind of felt bad for her .
it was very cold inside the restaurant .
my husbands pork was a small portion .
it was very inexpensive and i understand why .

but it certainly is sub-par .
the service was mediocre .
it has gone downhill badly .
very poor service and food .
the food was very poor .
we will not be going back .
the sauce was really disgusting .
their service is a hot mess !
just getting our drinks out was confusing .

nothing i had tasted good .
did n't seem handmade or anything like that .
service was incredibly slow .
i probably would n't go back .
the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .
our garlic bread came out literally black .
i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .
we will not be back .
every dish had several things wrong with it .
even the bread was stale .
the pasta is consistently overcooked .
i will not visit this restaurant again .

the way you are treated is sub par .
the entire staff was rude .
the customer service here is horrible .
i feel like everything i say is wrong .
very poor customer service at this location .
$ _num_ down the drain .
it was a horrible experience .
if only they could train their employees better .
the washer and dryer was old .
the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
there is also a _num_ inch ?
this is rather expensive as well .
this is not a bad place to live .
the shop is n't that great anyway .
it was made of wood .
i guess all customers are n't equal .
here is where my mistake happened .
sad , very , very sad .
not worth your money .
needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .
it tasted like milk and no coffee .
i was exceptionally disappointed .
6am is too early for her .
that 's _num_ % .
she never even looked at me .
was she having a bad day ?
i dont know , i do n't care .

it was all beans and guacamole .
this place is not _num_ stars .
it 's ... just ... not that good .
that pissed me right off .
second , the rolls here are sloppy .
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .
just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .
nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .
this place was mediocre at best .
but i 'd suggest you not !
texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
first of all , foods were n't impressive .
they are too pricy as well .
their foods are not that tasteful .
i do n't understand why he is working there .
he was so rude and ruined our friday night .
it 's really frustrating .
upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .
the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .
they actually screwed up a green salad .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
there are much better sushi choices available .
long story short : i ordered delivery .
vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
still , would not recommend .
was the worst i have ever had .

never been here before .
the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
man ... really bad from start to finish .
service is slow and horrible .
sushi is not flavorful at all .

the food is not that great .
the menu is blah and the food is also .
awful service , overpriced food .
do n't waste your money !
on arrival , waitress seemed lost .
the service here sucks .
it just sucks here .
however , the service is seriously lacking .
the service has always been very slow .
go in summer or no point in going .
it 's not going to happen .
ordered , is not .
a little pricy for food but not too bad .
it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
however , the food and service is sub par .
they went home hungry and very unhappy .
it 's not even summer yet .
that was definitely not the case though .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
service was slow and inattentive all night .
described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .
long story short , we wo n't be back .
overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .
will not be returning .
probably wo n't be back .
no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .
it looked rather like a barber shop .
the staff did n't look very professional either .
very poor service and atmosphere .
rotten food and over charging customer .
a lunch over charged and wasted .
did n't go so well .
who serves a drink without ice ?
the prime rib was fatty and cold .
the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .
the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .
the homemade bread was very sorry ... .
not worth the price .
the decor is very plain .
the food was underwhelming and pricey .
it 's just not that good .
this place is just a flat out joke .

food was overpriced and less than average .
she had zero personality .
now i really wish we would have .
never again will i go there .
i wo n't be back .
fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
interior could use an update .
sadly , however , they did not .
that does not make me chop liver .
in addition , the presentation was poor .
i could have done better at home .
i 'm really torn by this review .
but one is supposed to come here for steak .
extremely disappointing and appalling .
the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .
the steaks came and were both overcooked .
fail on all levels .
plus they have the worst presentation ever !
how far we have fallen .
our bill was over $ _num_ .
tip was $ _num_ .
poor , slow service .
this place is horrible .
you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .
i brought my boots here to get fixed .
i wo n't be going here again .
no accessible stalls in restrooms .
after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .
oh , but wait until i got my bill !
the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .
get me out of here !
i get that -- but the place was empty .
the place is empty .
it was such a nightmare .
i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .
the prices here can be ridiculous .
i mean , empty .
no one else in the same dining room .
not worth the attitude of the staff .
it was just meh .
all i could taste was citrus .
i was really disappointed with this visit .
we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
even whole foods is less expensive .
the service is most often rude .
the gelato counter was disappointing .
however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
this is just my experience .
cheap , everyone seems to say that .
but i was n't feeling it here .
i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
she did n't listen at all .
_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
no breaking of the ice .
this place is terrible !
we had the same experience when we walked in .
just kind of awkward , but no big deal .
a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .
tasty , but not real butter pecan .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
but these corporate suits refused .
a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .
what a disgrace to the marriott name .
finally they allowed me to put down cash .
do not stay here .
you will be disappointed .
the manager nowhere to be seen .
not personal at all strictly business .
no hello on entering .
not a _num_ star .
really a _num_ star .
do n't walk away .
not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .
linda b august _num_ will never stay again !
i could n't have been happier !
no bueno and no thank you !

i will not be staying at this location again .
i ca n't wait to check out .

for me the food was terrible .
they are in terrible shape .
i could n't believe it !
the place is rather run down .
the buffet was really terrible .
it just was n't a great environment .
soups were borderline offensive .
there probably wo n't be a wait !
worst chinese food in pittsburgh !
this is the worst chinese food i 've had .
and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .
the place was empty .
it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .
wo n't be eating there again .
not worth the trip .
meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .
the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
rules made by men .
when the food finally came it was bad .
the food itself was not too bad .
my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .
the food was terrible !
we quickly found out why .
i would not recommend this place for food .
this is a very small irish pub .
the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .
are you gon na eat that ?
the soda was flat .

food was not awful , but just barely average .

my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .
not gon na order from here again .
we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .
do not use this dry cleaner .
ehh ... it 's not all that .
cold cuts were good though pricey .
highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
that was not the first time .
i will not go back until they are gone .
a simple yes or no would have been nice .
in a very rude voice .
needless to say i walked away .
breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .
there was no internet at the time .
i would not bring a spider there .
it was just average , nothing special .
i wo n't be back .
they threw some tomatoes on it .
the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .
we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
tables were not very clean .
ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .
i really do n't see the hype .
i 've only eaten here once before .
not one employee even said hello !
long story short , we passed on dessert .
i wo n't go back .
they have a salt problem .
the lamb chops were awful .
the tomato was hard as rock .
but the worse is the pasta trio .
the concept is just so olive garden .
it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .
their menu does n't include really any .
the service was not very good .
it was not spicy .
i wo n't go back .
most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .
i was very disappointed with my meal here .
and was really disappointed .
too bad the food was n't good .
the beet salad was underwhelming .
and thus my rating of meh .
which is a huge shame .
this place had horrible service .
then , i ate here .
are these the same people running this restaurant ?
also , the service was not that good .
one word ; gross .
the wine list is lacking .
in short , avoid this place !
the main courses themselves were a disaster .
and the manicotti was watery and flavorless .
lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .
i was disappointed in the food !
i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .
colors and decor seem boring and out of style .
the service was horrible .
did i mention the service was bad ?
then it took another _num_ to order .
then _num_ mins to get our food !
however , seconds never came .
there was no background music .
the waiter was young and inexperienced .
would not recommend it .
the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .

our food was just average , nothing special .
the service was absolutely horrible .
i would probably not come back .
second , our food was served just barley warm .
we will not be back .
nothing to talk about .
the service was sub-par on a friday night .
over charge and terrible food .
terrible will never go back .
calamari was not fresh .
caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
i do n't remember it being this bad .

only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
it was downhill from there .
lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.
( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .
no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .
i had the pasta trio .
none of the pastas had any flavor .
the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
the three pastas were very , very basic .
i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !
i pushed it away ugh !
do n't be fooled !
it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !
try their calamari over angel hair yum !
lidia should be embarrassed .
grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
staff training is badly needed .

our main dishes were equally mediocre .
the duck breast was under done .
fake italian at its finest .

the bartender does n't belong in the business .
rude to patron and to his own colleagues .
and service is piss poor and understaffed .

i did not get a chance to eat there .
this was flat , one note .
yep , this place is terrible .

but the noodles are a disgrace .
no way , dudes .
i 'm not joking about the water .
pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
in fact i was quite disappointed .
for everything else , try the cat clinic .

at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
this was n't it .

also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !
maybe i just did n't order the right dish .
egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
service is not friendly .
turns out this was n't the case .
the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
i left , and do n't intend to return .

total dive bar with awful food and service .
diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .
not much for atmosphere .
sorry , but i just do n't get it .
i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
i dropped them off while i parked the car .
not sure what all the hype is about .
but the burger was n't memorable at all .
never understood all the hype about this place .
the burgers are rather bland and burnt .
and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .
every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
i did like the home fries , very yummy !
oh but it 's not .
it 's not me .
it 's just not that good .
burgers are adequate - nothing special .

did n't wait long to be seated .
waitresses were overwhelmed and avoided us .
they were soggy , and not crispy at all .
even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .

they are incredibly slow and ridiculously over priced .
very very slow service .
lot _num_ is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination .
too busy with your iphone ?
my merlot was decent but the calamari was not .

i might return for drinks but only drinks .
the food is bad !
entree _num_ : fish tacos .
another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes .
both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .
the food is mediocre ( at best ) .
the place is a total dump .

which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .
did we catch them on a bad day ?
thanks but probably wo n't be back .
both meals were served barely warm .
both plates were mediocre at best .
oh and that 's not the end of it .
unfortunately , the entrees were no better .
my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .
needless to say , my cannoli was awful .
do n't expect fresh food .
first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .
i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .
if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .
what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .

i have n't been back .
i rarely write negative reviews .

the server got my order wrong .
this place was horrible .
i was very excited to try this place .

my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
i just had the worst meal ever here .

just meh sorta flavorless .
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .
i told my friend to forget about it .
( oh , heck no ! )
what an awful experience .
my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
i would n't recommend it .
in a word : forgettable .
it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
the pizza was just ok .
that was really unprofessional .
the bottom and the top rated with grease .
it was still dripping with grease .
i assure you this place is n't it .
after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .
the pie it self was a real mess .
its a dry dough too , very dry .
the sauce is very forgettable and watery .
and just leave this one alone .
i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .
their sauce is so thin and tasteless .
the cheese is almost too much .
which you failed , because of your tire .
do n't waste your time and money here .
monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
we wo n't be back to this one .
was n't worth it for me .
just really lots of junk .
i 'd rather spend my money at goodwill !
it is now grossly over priced .
it tends to bring in the worst of people .
get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .

he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .
i feel ripped off .
same goes for the provolone wheel .
the bread was not fresh either .
i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .

they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
also , service was unfriendly .
there is such a thing as food too fast .
incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .
think twice people before going here .
they of course could care less about me .
what horrible service this place gives !
the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !
to date that has not happened .
it seems ridiculous , actually .
it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .

it was cold and not a good portion .
just not a good value for the $ .
it was a wet tasteless mess .
i may return if craving a good caesar .

the sushi was not fresh .
the sushi was n't rolled tight either .
there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .
they do not offer low sodium soy sauce .
actually , everything i ate was mushy .
their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
i did not have a good experience here tonight .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
this is not japanese food , period .
i swear it was worse than my first experience .
the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
the dough was also fairly dense .
the cheese ruined this pie .
all in all this pizza just sucks .
some good some bad .
even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
the chili soup was n't hot .
filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .

the service was terrible .

sad to see it go .
sad to see it go .

she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
i am so frustrated with this service .

wo n't be going back .
wo n't be going back .
no , she went ahead anyway .
massage but still had a _num_ hr .
wait which i left to run some errands .
the worst salon experience of my life .
i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
i have no clue what they gave me .
they just wanted to work , i guess .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
it 's always dirty .
do n't think the floor has ever been washed .
it 's like they hate their lives .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
overpriced merchandise that does not last .
even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
the salespeople are not pushy .
the coffee is okay , nothing special .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
so long story short , this place is packed .
it 's a little annoying .

get over yourselves people .
servers here can be really rude .
it was n't even that she said it .
i wo n't be back .
the wifi signal is weak .
the drinks are not so great .

its connection is also very spotty .
that 's about where the positives stop .
espresso is pretty bad .
this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
the damage was done .
do n't expect any help when things get ruined .
will never return to the store .
i was livid and called to complain .
they offered me nothing .
terrible customer service will never book with them again .
not worth your money !
this place is awful .
i mean , so so bad .
absolutely horrible customer service .
not sure what star rating to give .
as for beverages , they really skimp .
the bed was dirty too .
she was clearly in a hurry .

the haircut was $ _num_ .
they charge me for their mistake .
but that 's apparently the way they do it .
the head massage was painful and rough .
but i am not rushing back .
so disappointed with this place .
so disappointed with this place .

they do not stand by their mistakes .
customer service is poor .
this place is extremely overrated .
last night the service was especially lackluster .

dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .
and is _num_ dollars a glass .
drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
it was very cold .
needless to say i was extremely disappointed .
it was not enjoyable .
for the very first time the food was awful .
find a new chef quickly .
vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
pad thai at a fusion place ?
tandoori salmon was average .
why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
after the renovation the place lost its center !
... another one bites the dust !

sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
it was sad , really .
but it was downhill from there .
it was dry and average , at best .
it 's just not that good .
service is sketchy here at best .
those expectations kind of fell flat .
service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
it 's good , but too expensive .
i do n't think the price worth the food .
the portion is too small .
i mean really loud .
i will not recommend this establishment in the future .
rolls small lacking substance .
these place are virtually the same .
okay bagels though a little overpriced .
have consistently had rude customer service .
really turns me off .
the coffee 's terrible .
not worth the time and money to go here .
it 's all crap .
do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .
but do n't feel this way .
not horrible , just nothing to write home about .
i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
i 'm not kidding .
the egg and cheese were disgusting .
bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !
and the customer service was horrible .
the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .
avoid this place as all costs .

this place is going downhill fast .
first off , our waitress just was n't good .
bacon does n't take that long to cook .
so , that was really disappointing .
but it was n't over .
there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
only because i live nearby .
this place just bored me .
really do n't know what to say .
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
ours was n't plain and simple .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
it 's not even good bacon !
i have nothing good to say about this place .
this place offers really poor service .
i do n't enjoy doing it .
almost every time i have been let down .

i miss the old owner of the place .
pamela is a bad representation of this location !
the toppings on my salad were barely there .

that exchange was awkward too .
these people are very unprofessional and rude .
one of worst patient experiences .
his staff is embarrassed .

this giant eagle market district is garbage .
_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
the drinks are weak as well .
entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .
the service can also be rather slow .
my feet were still rough .
to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
it 's an embarrassment on walnut .
and you just lost all of our business .
does n't even deserve one star !
however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .
tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
however , this past visit was unfortunate .
the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .
but also way over prices .
service is bad when you enter .
if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .
the food is poor .
the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
far too much cream and cheese .
did n't finish this dish .
my wife had a chicken special .
not a good start .
not a good start .
very poor form on the owners part .
i then turned around and walked out .
and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .
food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !
reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
very rude and unacceptable .
i wo n't be going here again .
what a horrible experience !
this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
they do n't know how to do business .
they do n't help you to find a table .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .
the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .
basically , reservations mean nothing here .
unfortunately , the party stops there .
most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
i may or may not come back .
not off to a good start .
i will not be coming back .
decor leaves much to be desired .
i will never go back though .
way too expensive if you ask me .
it is such a rip off .
find someplace else in bloomfield .
also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
will not be returning .
sorry to say that will be my last visit .
the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
their staff is horribly rude that way .
they are completely mean and disrespectful .
horrible in every sense of the word .
they do n't c are .
not worth your money .
bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
very common problem in these apartments .
cant wait to move on .
the rent is too damn high .
the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
bingo , could n't have said it better .
it is not worth it .
management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .
i thought this was way too much .
this was my big mistake .
i do n't know .
they did not fix the building by the way .
also , my package was stolen twice .
elevator always has problems .
they do n't respect your privacy at all .
they 're all around rude to deal with .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
two words : grossly overrated .
unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
ca n't beat it .
we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
plus the bread was poor quality .
we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
way too rich to finish .
not deserving of the rave reviews .
breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .
they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
i also did n't love the service we received .
it was average , but not restaurant quality .
i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .
done in less than _num_ hours .
come now , i barely drink alcohol .
granted , i like to host social events .
so here comes the story of walnut capital .
we always took the trash out .
never again will i rent from this company .
- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
first , there are n't many tables .
however , the crepes are extremely over price .
otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .
what a completely miserable experience .
even the orange juice was bad .
i made an appointment weeks ago .
i said i could n't .
they refuse to put anything on paper .
every thing about this place is wrong .
i should not be responsible for the bill .
this place is the worst ever .
we shrugged it off and went to the bar .
terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .
just getting off work , i came alone .
neither of us were surprised .
the food handling left much to be desired .
this was sorely lacking .
not professional at all .
unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .
they were not met here .
the costumer service really ruined my experience .
awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .
try panera bread across the street .
we ai n't got no hashbrowns !
employees show no sense of urgency .
do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
do n't use the drive-thru .
but i quickly learned my lesson .
no less than _num_ minutes .
the drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins .
plus , the staff is rude .
worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .
also , the service is slow and poor .
worst wendy 's i have ever had .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .

it 's not romantic , just dim .
the food is only okay .
price is not bad .
not all her fault .
the worst chinese food i 've had .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
not very good chinese food here .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
the soup was a weird creamy mess .
it was just awful and the service was terrible .
is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?
anyway , the food was not very good .
in fact , it was awful .
i 'm not sure they were .
no need to ever return .
the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
crappy service and food .

i will not be ordering here ever again .
everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
too pricey for the quality .
crab cakes were awful .
worse than eat park quality .

delivery time was unimpressive .
otherwise , probably not .

not even worth a star .
on top of it , i got so sick .
my stomach was in knots for hours .

i would n't recommend going here .
extremely rude lady works there on sundays .
the worst bakery i ever shopped in !

do n't waste your time with this place .
worst nail salon ever .
not a smart move on my part .
it was just a bad scene .
it 'll never dry !

what a complete waste .
please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .
and the pedicure was really really painful !
but i left stressed and bleeding !
no wonder it is for sale .
do not get married here !
i would not suggest this bar to anyone .
ash trays all over the bar .
linda did not call .
nothing was the way i ordered it !
steve and linda were so rude and unprofessional !
either way , no need for rudeness .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
$ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .
egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .
first sign i chose to ignore .
nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
second sign i chose to ignore .
he was loud , very loud .
he was not asian .

third sign i chose to ignore .
nothing special in flavor or presentation .
perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
it 's never cold , never .
the service was poor .
unfortunately the food was a let down .
will not use this garage in the future .
sounded like i was flying a helicopter .
they just came up with some excuse .
careless workmanship is all you 'll find here .
i had a bad experience at penn automotive .
this place has gone down hill fast !
the drive thru is flat out dangerous .
try to avoid this location .
this is nothing new .
this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .
the prices are downright insulting .
is that too much to ask ?
it 's annoying , i get it .
but my hubby did n't know any better .
but kayla , our cashier ?
all right , now i 'm really done .
they gave me another burnt sandwich .
worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here .
avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief .
i will not be back .
these people are the worst .
better than subway , but not jimmy johns .
overall just a really bad experience .
not sure about the food handling practices here .
i heard her talking about customers very badly .
i do n't mind them being cash only .
i do n't mind the unpleasant cashiers .
i 'm begging you .
the atmosphere was atrocious .
the rest of the food was awful .
they were again completely flavorless , but warmer .
i hated this food and this experience .
the staff was rude .
i closed the door and she walked away .
that was insanely rude .

there 's not much left to say .
i 'm not sure its all made in-house anymore .
delivery was fast but the food was terrible !
the egg roll was soggy and cold .

not sure we will be back .
i was sick to my stomach when i left .
my cat is not eating .

pretty disappointed in my service here the other day .
but my patience was not even worth it .
upon arriving i immediately did n't feel welcome .
it tasted like hot chocolate .
things like that really bother me .
this place is dirty and the coffee is horrible .
ok i said i was sorry .
number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable .
actually , this is n't even a bad review .
just not going back there .
i have n't been here in a long time .
i should 've known better .
the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .
um , not me , thanks .
truly , if at all possible , avoid her !
i 'm nothing if not organized .
worst venue iv been to .
but it was n't during peak hours .
smoky , but not horribly so .
owner is rude & does n't handle customers well .
terrible service , rude staff .
while it was ok , it was n't great .
i wo n't be back .
they were frozen and certainly not worth the price .
the garbage and mail are very inconvenient .
this place is terrible .
the food was even worse than i remembered .
and it was very annoying !
she did n't refill drinks .
you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .
not a good idea .
the elevator moved really slow .
i think they probably deserve better .
the restaurant was worse for breakfast .
there were tables and servers ?
bad planning and execution ?
i do not support this unethical business practice .
i can not eat salad so ordered the soup .
turns out they do n't have soup .
do n't waste your time or money .
this particular location is horrible .
this used to be my favorite local waffle house .
i walked in and was a little surprised .
i will never be back .
the front waiting area was in mass confusion .
this is not an acceptable response for management .
we were starving waiting on our food .
i live _num_ minutes from their location .
not to mention , our order was wrong !
avoid at all costs ... .
this place is way over priced .
fired oysters and scallops over $ _num_ here .
the food was awful .
but they do n't even seem to have subs .
well ok i guess .
the building is old and dirty .
not one good thing to say .
i was n't able to find the _num_ lb .
ball within the already limited selection .
does zero good to complain .
obvious they could care less .
worst mcdonalds in the united states of america .
i could get food faster in a prison cell .
and a lot has changed for the worst unfortunately .
not to mention they do n't fill your drink !
i will not be a repeat patron .
like i said , i wo n't be back .
the range itself had terrible ventilation .
the lighting was poor .
my biggest complaint is pricing .
most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .
customer service was poor and unfriendly .
the bathroom was gross .
they will not get another dime of mine .
same guy , same attitude .
i was very disappointed with new china .
i would highly encourage others to go elsewhere .
i will not return to new china .

i have left bleeding twice .
hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .
just awful customer service .

alot of money for very poor care .
i will not be going back .
this pizza is mediocre at best .

they ripped me off .
they do n't even have a restroom for customers !
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .
i have n't use their service yet .
no return call either .
i wish i could give less stars .
i told her that was no problem .
she not only lost out on a past customer .
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .
chicken chewy and rubbery .
sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .
do not go for the pumpkin patch !
it 's really sad actually .
the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .
one week later it was empty again .
the room had a musty smell to it .
the parking situation is horrible .
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .
worst service in the area , by far .
food was ok , nothing much to speak of .
he did not understand and said , no coupon .
none of the regulars were there .
worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .
just chunks of tomato .
this was such a sour experience .
i wo n't be back .
save your money on the chili cheese fries .
i have been here a total of four times .
drinks are far too expensive to try any .
the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .
only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .
so fool me once , shame on me .
very rude service was in line for ten mins .
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .
so much for trying to support local business .
holly on the way to _num_ .
every order is wrong .
too bad even then the orders are not right .
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .
the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .
half of the floors do n't have vending machines .
internet access is $ _num_ per day .
answer : pretty bad !
it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .
i 'd say , skip this one .
that 's just nasty !
so i went through the whole thing for nothing .
there are no decent food options within walking distance .
it was n't me .
others in our group had problems as well .
not convenient for an early flight .
my sleep and stay was ruined .
the hotel itself is ok .
it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .
open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .
it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .
she was told that they only have one cart !
there is nothing to eat within walking distance .
i do n't need to spend my money there .
could n't do that !
im never going back .
no this was just gross .
my noodles were cold ... like really cold .
avoid at all costs !
was told there would be no problem .
this store is terrible .
took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !
this is not what you promised to sell me .
the clerk said she was sorry .
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .
i miss the old garden ridge .
no wonder the store was empty .
gave me a texas number .
too many other competent companies to model after .
im _num_ from ohio .
i shop alot , sometimes too much .
not very impressed with my last two trips here .
`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . ''
`` apologies for the mistake .
that 's not our usual practice . ''
i 've visited this store _num_ times .
first time nothing unusual happened .
i 'm not asking too much .
shes says , `` they 're not '' .
no sorry or who told you this .
i guess it does n't have to be .
i could not believe how filthy this store was .
the employees could have cared less as well .
am i still expected to keep waiting ?
these people are very difficult to do business with .
will take my money elsewhere .
btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .
if not , then go .
as another reviewer said it was set up weird .
first off , the beer menu .
ultimately , i was n't very impressed .
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .
we ca n't believe it .
to each his own , i guess .
i will not be coming back at all .
slowest deli department in town .
the food was not prepared well .
i have had better seafood elsewhere .
red lobster was not the place to be tonight .
the service was horrible .
it seem to be over before it started .
never received a refill on my soda .
but rather good could n't complain .
everything else is a joke .
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .
would not visit again .
worst service i have ever had .
i just do n't even know what to say .
it made my whole experience disappointing .
i wo n't go back to this location .
he was great but everything else was extremely slow .
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
food was mediocre as well .
wo n't be coming back .
are they going out of business ?
the sub was not one bit better than subway .
my bill : $ _num_ .
wo n't visit again .
bad business practices are very disappointing .
why is n't this practice illegal ?
he just put it on the bill .
worst customer service ever !
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
the worst customer service ever !
that 's is bad business !
they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .
did not want to buy another mattress online .
at this point , my patience are very thin .
i mean really , this is ridiculous .
my god the sun will be coming up soon !
the main waiting area is also empty .
i will never have another mri done there .
if you have an emergency do not come here .
go here to die !
sorry wo n't be back !
no way , no how .
i called back at 10am instead .
some rude nasty woman answers the phone !
the person checking me out was not hospitable .
she did n't say a word to us .
we felt bad , and stuck around .
a very frustrating moment indeed .
the other staff were horrible !
another lost sale opportunity .
they lost out big time with me .
my problem is with the alterations department .
they also rushed me during my final fitting .
very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !
brandy was the worst .
do not get your alterations done at this location !
this whole department is insane .
glad this is all over .
this store is not customer service friendly .
worst service i 've had in a long time .
so that was weird .
what a horrible experience !
they were just sitting down doing nothing .
i am definitely disappointed .
the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !
this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .
but this location puts the name to shame .
poor attention to detail , poor quality .
neither of us were impressed .
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
it was loud and crowded .
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
no hurry to go back there ... ever .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
ok , i did , and i stopped eating .
so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
it was just okay as a whole .
she gave me an attitude .
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
will never return to the restaurant .
worst italian food ever !
they should n't even call it italian food .
the bread was even bad .
do n't waste your time and money going here .
i was less than impressed .
the meatballs were greasy and very bland .
it was n't bad , just nothing great .
its like the place tries too hard .
my server lost me towards the end .
once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .
this food is just crap .
needless to say i was disappointed again !
never had problem at other locations .
will not return at this location !

false advertising on patio furniture .

after all it is taco bell .
the cheap part is always standard .
after all it is taco bell .
no consideration to the value of our time .

my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
worst experience in a long time .
our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .
it 's really gone downhill lately .

that he did n't know there was a problem ?
i wish i would have taken a picture .
it 's not a very good longhorn .
my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
then customer service wouldnt help me .
no thank you or thanks for you patience .

the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
overall , the experience was horrible .
the service was horrible .

very visible and inappropriate .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
that was not to be found here .

they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .
do not do business with these people .
shortly after , another lady comes over .
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
anyways , horrible experience .
this made my food experience not good .
the place is just older and needs some renovations .
want a zero star option !
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .

this place was disgusting !
the food was gross , greasy and very bad .
i gave it one star because of the waiter .
smells like wet dog .
service was very bad today .
the service however , left much to be desired .
our server was obviously having a bad night .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .
at that point our drinks were empty .
service is very bad .
waitress was throwing plates on the table .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
food came slow and was cold .
there i was very disappointed .
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
the strawberry was too sweet .
a refill was never offered .
no one was at the door to greet me .
what a terrible manager !
slow service and a mediocre meal .
so far really slow food service .
okay , but wo n't be going back soon .
really made me sad .
its not like she got nothing out of it !
the fries were bad .
not crispy but chewy and not very salty .
does n't seem like good customer service .
never again will i deal with these useless morons .
this was a no go for me .
_num_ hour later it was completed .
the owner called me to apologize .
i probably wo n't be back .
it is my pet peeve .
he tried to `` screw '' me over .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
simply put , horrible experience .
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
so , obviously , no free refills .
really sad about this one .
the pricing is ridiculous .
this is not ihop quality food .
i was very uncomfortable .
i would not leave my dogs there .
too bad , jared 's .
printed out my receipt .
couple weeks later , no phone call .
she was having a hard time finding my order .
this is a review of their business practices online .
slow , absolutely the worst .
horrible communication skills and customer service .
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
this midas location is grossly overpriced !
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
there 's a reason no one goes here .
do n't bother to stop .
you have been warned .
worst arby 's in the planet .
the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .
otherwise , it stinks .
but this was nasty .
that 's not too bad , right ?
you 'll have a much nicer experience .
some things cold , when they should be hot .
not clean , either .
_num_ per person not worth it .
went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .
tons of garbage and food under these carts .
then all the food was cold and hard .
did not like it .
not the cleanest establishment .
do n't think i 'll be back .
avoid this place like the plague !
not going for it .
because there regular food is mall grade at best .
they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .
just not worth it .
pleasant staff , but poor quality work .
they damaged my car .
highly recommend you find another car wash .
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .
i 've taken my car here at least twice .
both times it failed on a defective license bulb .
my guess is they were understaffed .
not our best ihop experience .
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
cold grits are n't a treat .
the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
terrible service and terrible food !
in summary the service is very questionable .
i could n't agree more .
guess it was ok ?
otherwise it was _num_ miles .
that was a little awkward though .
they are not very through .
typical fast chinese food .
this is not one of them .
boneless ribs were n't typical .
but bags were covered in grease .
rice was over cooked .
there is no lobby .
this rink just did n't blow my mind .
they serve beer and wine !
really need to put some money into this place .
entire place smells like wet dog .
they have an assortment of beer and wine .
i ask again , are they hot ?
she did n't massage anything .
he did the total opposite .
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
sadly not worth the money or time .
i was planning to go again but not anymore .
services between spas are typically the same .
it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
i 've been a yelp user for years .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
common areas needed to be vacuumed !
but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .
then staff tried to get in !
coffee pot in our room was broken .
_num_ stars might be too generous !
this place is awful .
this trip has no internet .
this place is disgusting .
my room was not clean .
the air did not function properly .
this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
nor has the manager ever returned my message .
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
and once again , pretty nasty .
will not be staying here again .
the place was so slow .
$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .
this was not a four star dining experience .
four star _num_ diamond yea right .
no creativity to the cooking .
the steak was overcooked .
most of our bill was the wine .
could have being very good but it was not .
i find it acceptable , but nothing special .
i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .
nothing special on this menu ... .
it was n't even spicy .
by now , my companions had finished eating .
nothing to write home about .
do n't understand the hype .
not a good dinner place .
this showmars used to be awesome .
i would have given it _num_ stars .
this showmars is under new management and it sucks !
also , the portions are not as big .
change management and has gone down hill .
i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?
and everything is ala carte !
i was not impressed by anything here .
it appears that the oven was too hot .
nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
we do n't care !
i wish i could leave a no star rating .
worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !
i poured my own wine refills .
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
this last experience was by far the most disappointing .
_num_ sides came out late .
so i had to eat my sides cold .
they made it anyway and gave it to me .
there is no excuse .
they did not have many items .
do they not make fresh brew coffee .
starbucks is not the right one for me .
not like you starbucks !
but this was pretty bad .
it just is n't up my alley though .
also the bathrooms where in bad shape .
i really hate this place .
simply a bad experience .
the beer specials and _num_ .
seems he was already looking to replace the manager .
we walked in and it was awkward .
no waitress no one else walking around .
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
will not be back .
the music was too loud for conversation .
summary : very noisy , terrible service .
wild dogs could n't drag me back .
my braised short ribs were all bones !
we will not be going back .
apparently , reservations are not valued here .
did n't get our food until after _num_ .
food is n't good either .
greasy and the batter was peeling off .
i did n't get what i ordered .
i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .
even adding salt and pepper did not help it .
easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .
for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .
i will not be coming back .
the mediocre : everything else .
and questioned why it was cold .
bread pudding is always warm no ?
and , all were nothing to write home about .
know your customers , bring back the stew .
hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !
worst lunch option uptown .
i will not be returning .
server was very slow and was n't attentive .
bouncer was extremely rude .
the food came quick but no potato soup .
the service itself was n't to great either .
the wait staff was not that great either !
we walked in and waited to be sat .
no one came or even looked at us .
the bartender looked at us walked away .
after _num_ minutes he never returned .
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .
food is decent , but service is no good .
no in this restaurant are polite .
unfortunately , the food was sub-par .
the worst part were the soy beans .
the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .
disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .
used to be so much better .
everything we ordered was very very bland .
very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .
wo n't be back .
fried dumplings were thick and mushy .
the ramen soup was bland .
egg roll was sour of all things .
hot and sour soup also bland .
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
again , very bland .
not much of a coconut taste either .
not sure if i 'll try again .
waste of a cheat meal .
worst chinese food i 've had in a while .
this seemed quite bizarre .
why give french fries with most of them burned ?
the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .
it 's my fault , i guess .
the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
the bread was cold and hard .
tried their philly cheese steak .
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
it was kind of uncomfortable .
no management present that we could see .
so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?
walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
room three does n't smell much better .
again , stale and moldy .
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
not a good sign .
this place is not worth the price !
only _num_ stars for location .
wow , i was wrong .
i found all of this very unacceptable .
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .
loud , loud , loud !
the `` new '' rooms are terrible .
for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .
terrible for business travel .
no desk type chair .
just a poor design all around .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
the room are _num_ stars .
when we got back to our hotel .
stomach hurts all night .
oh well , their loss .
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .
one star because zero was n't an option .
they just said thank you and walked away .
was not impressed at all .
did not taste like hibachi at all .
i just had such a bad experience here .
do n't even get me started .
but the service is horrible .
do n't think i 'll be coming back .
an expensive hassle for such terrible service .
what a mistake it was .
but they are n't reliable .
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
they do n't care about your clothes .
pay more elsewhere for better quality .
there was nothing really special about the food .
dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .
just dont expect anything amazing .
that might make it a little better .
would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
also they were not that tender .
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
i will not be going back .
the food was bad , yo .
like , below applebee 's bad .
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
i was n't impressed with this place .
we walked out and still nobody noticed .
this used to be my favorite place uptown .
really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
not sure we would return anytime soon .
bad service and mediocre food served cold .
if i could give negative star rating i would .
the wings were fine , but nothing special .
the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .
then no , i have not gotten my beer .
she again left for another _num_ minutes .
the chicken was supposed to be grilled .
fries with burger were luke warm .
but obviously we have no plans to go back .
half the time our drinks were empty .
so what was the point in an app ?
caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
there are no free meals in america andrea !
we had the worst experience at this place !
it ruined our first visit in charlotte .
the chicken was flavorless and tough .
the fries were cold and mushy .
will not come back here .
the food was also disappointing .
the chicken breast was so small .
worse was that there was no flavor .
it was just all around bland .
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
bartenders were terrible and not attentive .

nobody tried to even convince us to stay .
2nd time service was extremely slow .
nothing that really stands out .
_num_ minutes later we were sat .
neither of us touched our food .
the veggies were overly salty table round .

in short , our experience here was awful .
the burgers were just okay .
not particularly flavorful but edible .
the sticks were not actually pretzels .

the service was awful .
it was not a gluten free menu at all !
very disappointed with this restaurant .

that was $ _num_ down the drain .
fish was not fresh .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
do n't waste your time ... .

the place just seemed small and shabby to me .
the crab dip was another disappointment .
first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .
it was very , very bad .
[ the bad . ]

_num_ outside , _num_ inside .
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .
he said , `` we only have _num_ .
my order was wrong .
i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .
[ the not so bad . ]
so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .
avoid this place even if free .
the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .
the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .
the potatoes were like tater tots .
it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .
this could be an awesome place to stay .
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .
his key does not work either .
later they apologize for the error .
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .
i absolutely hate this place .
the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .
it was not my pillow .
the beds were uncomfortable .
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .
i will never be back .
do not stay here if you have a choice .
so why the low rating ?
here 's the bad points .

more screaming and yelling than the night before .
beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .

this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
$ _num_ for anything !
i just came from there .
it is not safe for kids !

this place is not worth the price .
not one said would you like some water .

apologizing of course , but still uncomfortable .
it turned out mostly mediocre .
do not fall for the hype .
it was all downhill from there .
i should 've known better .
overly intrusive server did n't help .
the balsamic whatever sirloin was awful .
still waiting on more phone calls to be returned .
i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich .
not that the food was bad , mind you .
it was just meh .
chicken was a bit dry .
not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess .
now that would have been an improvement .
the worst food ever .
hands down , not worth your time or money !
and let us not forget the worst restrooms ever .
do n't waste your time or money !
but beyond that , total meh .
the food is not very special at all .
service was nice , the place was fairly empty .
this is what knocked the 3rd star off .
overall not a bad experience .
get your shit together .
guess i got spoiled by the washington post .
i tried paying my bill online .
so why does my bill say different .
i did not have one of those .
did not receive another paper until july 6th .
sounds sorta like stealing , does n't it ?
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
these people are unbelievable !
ugh worst serves ever !
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
it was just not worth the aggravation any longer .
i did n't even answer them back .
the rating is a zero !
worst paper on the planet .
all in all this meal was just sad !
disappointed is an understatement .
i will not be back .
the worst service ever .
avoid this place at all costs .
the food is disgusting .
do n't bother with this place .
waited about _num_ - _num_ minutes .
avoid at all costs .
do n't bother going .
thanks but no thanks .
i always notice that chicks is super slow .
the food was not good however .
the chicken tasted like mystery meat .
only two stars due to the lack of selection .
$ _num_ car bomb shots !
the selection here is horrible .
upstairs and outside areas are tight too .
immediately walking in you are struck by a smell .
lots of tables and benches or chairs .
they even had corn hole .
never again well i spend money in this establishment .
and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .
not an authentic irish bar , by any means .
called this morning to check about the watch .
no one call me at all .
avoid at all costs .
minus _num_ star for that .
well , not so much .
i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches ... .
i 've been standing in line for _num_ min .
he could n't remember what i ordered .
the service is lousy .
same sandwhich never costs the same price .
good bagels , but it had horrible customer service .
the garden veggie soup is watery , not recommended .
that may be an exaggeration , but probably not .
i do n't need this , seriously .
i will not be going back again .
will not go back .
the bisque was lukewarm at best .
the chocolate cake was cold & hard .
either way , i wo n't be coming back .
the tilapia was a complete opposite !
no salt at all !
my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .
steak was over cooked .
atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .
and just walked off .
every single bite was perfection !
drop the bad attitude and step it up .
the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .
kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .
aside from that , the desserts were good .
just nothing to write home about .
they did the same service for $ _num_ .
a few simple items turned into a large bill .
not again for me .
these guys are the worst shop in charlotte .
they scratched my car .
greyhound is a nightmare !
avoid the dirty dog if you can !
this station lacked in communication in every way possible !
ugh unreal and frustrated to the tee !
is n't that your job ?
and i was denied priority boarding .
that 's not how you treat people .
lazy workers , all rude and incompetent .
this place is horrible .
it also reeks of a unpleasant scent .
it was a nightmare .
ridiculous i will never patronize again .
somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .
drink price : $ _num_ for a beer .
would i go here again ?
i do not see myself returning .
for a fri night , the service was slow .
no wonder empty on friday night .
but food and drinks were disappointing .
i will not go back .
at this point we had n't complained .
i will not be back .
it 's not sanitary .
very very disappointed by how this place accompanied us .
very disappointing to say the least .
and she never acknowledged us previously either .
not sure about this place .
just not my kind of place .
it never seems that clean .
but not in a good way .
it 's just a worn out place .
they do n't even really serve breakfast .
do not live here .
i would strongly advise against living here .
i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .
the parking in this place is ridiculous .
do not go here if you want quick service .
also very over priced .
very poor customer service .
there are too many options in uptown .
i will not try them again .
worst customer service , even by post office standards !
disgusting , slow and pathetic .
there luckily was a subway up the street .
i would not recommend this cleaner .
clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .
it felt awkward to be there .
the room was not very nice .
wireless connection at this place is horrible .
however , staff was nice and accommodating .
furniture was very dated .
rooms were not quiet to say the least .
for the price this is a _num_ star .
for location this place is a _num_ star .
lots of other hotel choices in the area .
not even an apology note .
room decor is old and bed was not comfortable .
tv was newer , but remote was terrible .
the ritz ... and then what ?
the walls and doors are paper thin .
we will not be staying here again .
i can not believe my experience with this hotel .
we only stayed one night .
the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable .
-the cable tv went out every _num_ minutes .
-the room was just dingy .
the bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable .
nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately .
however , my room was foul .
this was my first trip to charlotte .
ripped curtains , blown out light bulbs in bathroom .
it continued for two hours .
this ruined my anniversary !
it 's tired and needs a major overhaul .
this place is soon so gross .
i vote anywhere else .
if you are lucky turn down service will happen .
instead i felt really ripped off .
everything else screamed _num_ .
however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .
stay away , there are many better options downtown .
wo n't be back .
loud music until like _num_ am .
i had to wait in the lobby for hours .
i agree with previous reviewers ... going downhill fast .
this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .
wish i would have read yelp first .
wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .
the bathroom is total trash .
go for drinks , eat elsewhere .
this place is closed _num_ years ago .
terrible service and experience !
i am very disappointed and upset right now .
no call to update me or explain the delay .
get them in , get them out .
screw me over once , shame on you .
the pair never was ordered .
they sent the original glasses off to be filled .
i called over the waiter and explained .
guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
this place is downright bizarre .
the salad was just alright , nothing terribly impressive .
will not be going there again .
very confused by this spot .
it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .
everything else ... so-so .
very busy with short wait times .
difficult to hold conversations .
seating too close together .
i 'm totally confused .
not falling for the trick .
terrible selection , rude !
the whole area was pretty rude .
no real kids menu .
ok no biggie , but then came the food .
let me just get your drink orders . ''
i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .
not very friendly and welcoming , just adequate .
at $ _num_ , i was not impressed .
they had no baked potatoes .
mashed potatoes was my only choice .
i ate them , but nothing special .
do n't stay here .
i will never return to red roof in .
_num_ came and went and no shuttle .
room does not look like hotels.com photos .
do not stay here .
probably the worst hotel ever .
something fishy is def going on here .
she asks me what i ordered .
wo n't be back .
worst experience ever at a wendy 's !
my daughter 's drink order was wrong to start .
then it took forever to get our burgers .
once we received our burgers one was wrong .
i asked for ketchup and was handed _num_ packets .
avoid this location if you can .
every other experience there was nearly as bad .
the nurse said nothing and just kept going .
it is subpar and out of the freezer .
nothing is homemade and food is dry .
grocery stores are always open .
so i 'm reading the back .
and then i just got mad .
do they think we are idiots ?
restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well .
our waiter was awful .
will not be back to that location !
i should have probably ordered from the diet menu .
service was extremely slow .
hit and miss for lunch and summer .
pathetic , no other way to describe this brunch .
sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled .
it 's been _num_ minutes since i first ordered .
sad to say , this was a big mistake .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
never use this place .
hard to believe how they stay in business .
the customer service is not what i expected .
would n't go back .
sadly that is n't the end .
i was very clear in the preferences i stated .
you do n't tell a customer what to like .
oh but that 's not all folks .
anyway , we were dropping off three rings .
seriously , and it gets much worse .
not a way to gain a new customer !
my wife then confirmed her day off from work .
no one answered the phone during business hours .
neither of our messages were returned .
the worst customer service ever !
first go around - not too bad .
the owner was beyond rude !
made many promises and failed to keep them .
very rude and unprofessional guy !
not willing to work out anything with the customer .
would not recommend this company to anyone .
zero stars for this guy .
its consistent , bad service or lack there of .
the store itself is fairly clean and generic .
there was no voicemail option .
we will never use sam 's club again .
customer service is a joke .
said something to manager and they did n't care .
completely ripped me off .
everything else is nasty .
go back to florida , they like it there .
bland bbq , bland chicken .
this location was kind of busy .
the entree was a dry .
i do n't know where to start .
when our food finally arrived it was a disappointment .
corn bread just taste bad .
do n't eat here !
so go thee instead .
never ever going back .
my experiences have not been satisfactory at all .
save yourself the frustration !
i have never received worse customer service .
i really could care less at the moment .
it seemed a little rough .
do n't you do this all day ?
could n't you have told me to move ?
overall , kind of an irritating experience .
i do not recommend south charlotte animal hospital .
the nurse was very short with me .
what animal hospital does not stock those items ?
for an annual , the price was outrageous .
i will not be returning .
do n't bother making an appointment for this place .
never fear , she sold us a ticket .
this place is filthy and outdated .
the snack was another problem .
- workers : rude , rude , rude .
are you kidding me ?
do n't buy your tickets online !
most we had to wait was _num_ minutes .
specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude .
poor , poor customer service .
wow just really bad .
carowinds in my opinion is crap .
poor customer service in all parts of the park .
im done w this place .
first parking is a joke and a crime .
some of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting .
should have wait times listed for rides .
park is n't very clean .
bathrooms are filthy and smell awful .
i would not recommend purchasing extras online .
only purchase the basic tickets .
$ _num_ mistake ( _num_ people ) .
- $ _num_ for chicken tenders and fries ?
no other entertainment was available while we were there .
much better value for money spent .
saving up that six hundred bucks to go elsewhere .
park was beyond rude and unhelpful about it .
food is expensive and nasty .
however , it 's not worth it here .
it 's miserable . ''
carowinds has horrible line management .
avoid this place if you have the option .
what is really bad is the food was horrible !
the customer service is atrocious .
ummm ... excuse me !
so sad carowinds has become such a disappointment .
plus do n't even try complaining to guest services .
we sadly left with extreme disappointment !
will not go back to carowinds !
the line was over three hours long .
drove _num_ hours to get to the park .
still charging $ _num_ plus $ _num_ for parking .
i would definitely not take your family .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
worst experience of my families life .
same with food , souvenirs and entrance tickets .
we only spent maybe _num_ mins in that line .
then our day took a turn for the worse .
we did n't get to ride that .
do n't get excited like i did .
so , i am really really disappointed carowinds .
worst food ever got sick .
for nothing i needed !
duke energy is the only electric company in town .
their customer service is terrible .
the company is run by morons .
duke energy pulled some really shady crap on us .
worst experience on the phone with customer service ever !
i do not recommend going here .
the woman in charge was downright rude .
nothing more ; nothing less .
it 's $ _num_ a head .
not a good mix .
on the week ends it is $ _num_ dollars .
should have only paid per ride .
felt like someone was holding my whole body down .
so i dropped it off for a week .
when i picked it up : _num_ .
they did n't even paint the roof .
no body work was done .
customer service leaves much to be desired .
ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .
saturday rolls around , no call .
the next week starts , still no call .
entire car was dusty , inside and out .
truly the worst customer experience ever .
no way to rate a _num_ !
the room smelled awful .
only _num_ towels for _num_ people !
i wish i would have taken photos .
this hotel is old and poorly managed .
they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .
why am i being charged for your mistakes ?
not nearly impossible , literally impossible .
my room reeked of mold and mildew .
the next room was worse .
i could not believe it .
the water was very hard .
it got cold at night .
the room itself was not too bad .
went on the visit and nothing was done .
they are lazy ass hell !
do n't waste your money or time .
find another place where the doctors care .
it makes me very unhappy .
avoid uptown at all costs .
because _num_ is n't an option .
extremely poor customer service .
and we went over by _num_ cent !
are you kidding me ?
pay less has better !
this is just ridiculous .
this location is not well maintained by management .
always extremely slow service and long lines .
crime is a problem !
oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
now it 's getting very ghetto .
the men 's locker room is always nasty .
to be fair , we knew it was pricey .
same with my ginger ale .
slow , slow , slow .
or if someone else is picking up the tab .
lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless !
i am in boston , not charlotte .
i would never patronize a place like this .
ok , i 'm lying .
the service was atrocious and incredibly slow .
so nobody went home with their own food .
not quite horrible , but not quite good either .
edible is a better word for it .
sounds fancy , eh ?
manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .
um , probably not .
nothing to write home about .
the duck was really rough & fatty .
i preferred them over the duck .
for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .
the food was decent .
service was absolutely horrible !
it was very bizarre !
sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online .
would n't go back .
but not the place if you 're super hungry .
all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .
pop and they were down the hatch !
the only good thing was the lemon drop martini .
i am sorry to be writing this review .
but , this evening was an utter disappointment .
btw ... coffee was $ _num_ .
sorry , but i will not go back .
probably would not go back .
went for a girls night for restaurant week .
this was not a good steak .
the cookie was terrible !
do n't think i will be back .
disappointed in my queens feast choice .
wish i could go back and choose again .
i 'm a foodie and disappointed .
reservation for _num_ on a saturday made with ease .
maybe a warning sign .
it was also very loud .
the service was ok , but not great .
our waters were n't refilled but once .
i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .
beyond that our waitress was rude .
probably the worst mother 's day brunch in charlotte .
the fruit was mediocre .
the salad was n't good .
the vegetable station was n't appealing .
there were very few vegetables to order with it .
we sure wish we had gone somewhere else .
it 's a shame .
eventually i just gave up .
three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .
_num_ orders of this .
he could n't drink it .
did n't really care for the food here .
there are better restaurants to frequent .
blue could be great but it 's not .
there was only one sushi chef on duty .
owner was extremely polite .
waitress was not the best .
surely there are better places in town .
there was no flavor at all .
it 's just not good .
this is the worst sushi place in charlotte .
the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .
worst chicken pad thai i 've ever had .
was sick to my stomach all afternoon .
the noodles were not good either .
worst experience of my life .
i did n't like it .
the waiter never did refill my water glass .
felt rushed even though other tables were available .
do not waste your time here .
you 're better off taking your money elsewhere .
do n't go for the jerk chicken .
i was sooo very disappointed .
plates that are old and worn .
will not go back .
very dirty and disgusting .
got up and walked out .
i wish zero stars were an option .
there were no other diners in the restaurant .
just a bad experience all around .
but i 'm not going to anymore .
they simply ca n't get the orders right .
tonight was the last straw .
never ordering from this place again .
this is a trash and security problem .
`` me never come back here '' .
was really disappointed about that .
first of all , the customer service was great !
our total bill was almost $ _num_ .
worst auto bell in town .
it was n't even decent enough for one star .
literally , the entire store , no bread !
monday you did n't have meat .
spend your money eating something w personality !
and the service last time i came was horrible !
there is no tomorrow .
i will not go back !
he never responded to my call for repairs .
maybe my standards are too high .
i felt like i was robbed .
but it just fails to deliver too often .
once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .
i was so glad it was over .
this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
no bed side manor .
horrible experience and expensive .
if they had not i would have left .
the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .
my husband and i ate here this evening .
the server brought some cold , salty garlic rolls .
my ravioli was barely cooked .
that , like i said , i give up .
just plain salty and awful .
the crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse .
with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .
leftovers are in my future .
still , i was n't blown away by it .
i do n't see a return in my future .
it was good but nothing to rave about .
y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .
when i say frequent , i mean every friday .
i was rather disappointed in most aspects .
the pasta was also overcooked .
totally not worth it .
we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .
even the rolls were almost stale .
maybe i 'm weird .
one time recently the server was really inattentive .
i had a pizza and it was quite bland .
the food here was just adequate .
the last few times out experience was just fair .
i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .
shrimp is either cooked or it 's not .
incredibly bad management and ownership .
i know where i am not welcome .
i guess i do n't really have a choice .
i was very disappointed !
it was much better than the spicy pasta .
took money out of my account for late fees .
never notified me , never called nothing .
ca n't wait to go back !
worse customer service i have received in quite awhile .
sorry i bothered you from sitting on your *** .
suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .
too bad i ca n't give no stars .
will not return ever .
i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .
charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .
dishonest , poor quality and bad attitude .
recently i placed a take out order .
hmmm , he charged me only $ _num_ .
i was n't impressed at all .
could n't get to the bar .
no service once there .
the salad was just so-so .
i travel to clt fairly regular on business .
waitstaff was not helpful with the menu .
the food was mediocre at best .
sadly , both experiences were less than stellar .
bland does n't begin to describe the food .
even my little children were totally unimpressed .
food was very bland and watery .
the food was not to my liking at all .
the food was warm and nothing was heating it .
was very disappointed with level of quality and service .
they also seemed arrogant and rude .
i now know why this place is always empty .
the spice was horrible .
life is too short .
none of the items were cooked properly .
wo n't be back .
the standard is appalling .
it was poorly made and poor ingredients were used .
let alone very poor value for portion size .
there are not much options for buffet on sunday .
and coming to the taste it is horrible .
disappointed with the quality of the food .
it did not taste authentic .
i was quite disappointed .
the food ai n't bad .
- just iceberg lettuce and cucumber !
it did n't taste like anything !
the flavor for the coconut curry was very bland .
terrible service , waiter was extremely rude .
do yourself a favor and do not eat here .
one of the worst restaurant experiences .
they had been our favorite for years .
every item of food was really unimpressive .
even all other orders were very well below average .
the veggies were the only high spot .
the brown rice was mushy .
over _num_ % of the class failed the final .
do not waste your money .
it does n't get any worse than this !
right off the bat she said `` no . ''
nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .
just basic chinese food .
not steamed or toasted and not soft .
`` oh no , it 's after six ?
no note or sign for explanation .
unfortunate because i would have enjoyed trying it !
run , do not walk away from this place .
unless you do n't mind paying a fortune .
after taking one bite i 'm less than satisfied .
it 's cold and completely unimpressive .
this place is awful do n't trust them .
flavorless , undercooked , and late .
papa johns should be ashamed of themselves .
the person could n't get the information right .
no stars and no more business from us !
the french fries are ok , i guess .
i wo n't be going back .
very slow `` servers '' .
not sure if this was fixed or not .
overly sweet and not so appetizing .
nothing to rave about , but not terrible either .
i was very disappointed .
i will be getting my chinese food elsewhere .
the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .
i 've had worse .
my cookie had no fortune .
and the beef with broccoli was worse !
on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
seriously , do n't go here .
rice and the veggies i got were no problem .
nothing to write home about and pretty expensive .
i was very disappointed in the food .
they were essentially fried wontons , not crab rangoon .
i will not be ordering from here again .
this place has really fallen off .
food was _num_ mins late .
everything was not in my order on delivery .
delivery has gone downhill .
i was very disappointed with food here .
canned soda no refills .
it has gone downhill .
mine did n't show up in my delivery order .
neither was spicy at all .
boiled pasta would have had more flavor .
, the beers are cheap and cold .
guess the best advice , just pay at door .
they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .
but my praise begins and ends there .
not even open on saturday mornings ?
the chicken was overly breaded and very soggy .
crab rangoon was terrible .
also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .
the worst pizza hut ever .
do not go to this one .
this type of service is just completely unacceptable .
wrong pizza was delivered .
this location has the worst service .
was n't memorable , exciting or impressive .
i can not believe this place exists !
avoid at all costs !
we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .
not worth the money .
the ravioli app was cold and tasteless .
we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
while everything was decent , nothing really came together .
interesting old house feel to the place .
the hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty .
this is not authentic cajun food !
but this last time was horrible .
every dish we had was completely flavorless .
the fried green tomatoes were blah .
the batter was n't tasty at all .
the seasoning was weak .
the portions were good .
neither one of my two friends finished their plates .
i will not be going back .
but not a good group night .
i do not understand the hype about this place .
this was our first visit to this restaurant .
the food was spicy not flavorful , just spicy .
needless , to say not a great experience .
i would n't return or recommend this place .
they lack favor in their food .
it was not good .
the bad : food is mediocre .
the final insult : the grits .
so incredibly let down by this dining experience .
meanwhile , the food was terrible .
how does one mess up a cookie pie ?
do not waste your money !
the seasoning certainly did not taste cajun to me .
bottom line : i will not be going back .
the owner could care less about customers .
nothing cajun about it .
they did not use our groupon correctly .
save your money and dine elsewhere .
the food is barely ok .
she came back _num_ min later .
do n't waste your time .
still , not the big easy .
_num_ - new orleans .
very dissatisfied and disappointed .
will not go back .
the past three times have been very disappointing !
either way i will not go back .
the staff is unfriendly and rude .
so of course , i refused it .
trying cajun yard dog next .
watery gumbo started off our meals .
no one finished their meal .
i will definitely not visit this place ever again .
my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .
this place is awful !
at that point i was ready to leave .
i was so mad .
i will never never never never never go back .
horrible customer service and horrible food .
i did n't eat it .
fried green tomatoes were good .
bbq shrimp were fine .
i 'll never return again .
creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes .
it was just embarrassing to new orleans .
i did n't even bother going on .
downstairs tables are too close .
even the rolls sucked ; very dry and tasteless .
then change how you handle your customers .
mac and cheese boring , bland , no flavor .
does anyone know where the old managers went ?
this new chicken box cafe is terrible .
this is no longer the chicken box cafe .
it was empty when i arrived around _num_ pm .
wow , how rude !
do n't go here you will get ripped off !
oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .
i 've never been treated like this .
their work is shoddy and inconsistent at best .
but it was a mixed rack ... .
mac & cheese : so , so .
two words ... ... keep driving !
this place is disgusting !
food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !
the food is ok but the service is awful .
you just get in your car and drive .
that 's what ruined the racing experience . )
customer service was seriously lacking .
i just did n't feel welcomed .
i 'm barely decent on the track but geez .
hopefully i get a better experience next time .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .
apparently , the adult races run every hour .
i really did n't want come back here though .
they should just say its a flat rate charge .
outdated for the volume of traffic handled .
`` could be _num_ .
i repeat , this is a station review !
that 's a problem for another review .
and it is ugly .
staff are totally rude .
no southern hospitality whatsoever .
she asks my husband to reschedule .
monday , no phone call all day .
none to be had here !
holes burned in comforter .
stayed one night in _num_ bedroom unit .
he slept on the sofa both nights .
for being a hilton i was n't too impressed !
do n't waste your time or money .
i wish i could give a minus _num_ .
only if you 're lucky though .
the layout of clt is terrible .
i ca n't stand this airport .
the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .
one of my least favorite airports .
security is beyond the worst .
i could n't help myself .
this is the worst airport layout ever .
tsa security is the worst .
generally a dirty airport ( delta terminal ) .
please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport .
i 'm not sure which is the worse nightmare .
this airport has ridiculously long lines .
very outdated , and super crowded .
this airport is just kinda weird .
your free wi-fi is totally useless .
internet is free but outdated .
slow and hard to get on .
it will only get worse .
that 's a deal breaker for me .
- tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive .
- not enough direct flights in or out .
long term parking lot was way over crowded .
i 've only been traveling all of my life .
why do they have no tram ?
except all of them were yelling over each other .
so help me god , i do n't care .
i do n't feel bad .
not a terrible experience but not an amazing one .
i like lax as my favorite airport .
and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .
we officially hate charlotte .
everyone who works in this airport is miserable .
every place i 've eaten here is horrible .
this airport is not the best .
it is not near the top of my favorites .
worst us airport ever !
and she does n't do stairs at all !
clt is begging for a major renovation !
the location , however , is stellar .
um , this airport sucks , okay ?
avoid at all costs .
i flew through here two times last week .
my problem here is that i expect better .
not a fan at all .
worst airport in the area .
never come to clt on monday morning .
security lines are ridiculous .
they do n't put toilet paper in the stalls .
they do n't clean urine off the toilet seats .
at this point i 'm tired of hearing that .
ridiculous planning if you ask me !
luckily there was _num_ more flight that night .
the absolute worst baggage handling times .
crowded with narrow walkways .
this is not the airport for international connecting flights .
worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm .
you lose three stars for these things .
the guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency .
they need to get this fix quickly .
you could probably walk it by then , twice .
no one seems to know what 's going on ?
nope not any better this time around .
worst baggage claim area i 've ever experienced .
called several airlines they were unable to find anything .
in the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding .
terrible airport for a layover .
lots of places to spend money !
_num_ 1/2 star rating ?
all your outlets ... lol .
i am not that ugly ... i think .
huge waste of a layover .
the bathrooms are super outdated and small .
but it 's also dead .
i am not a fan .
this airport is not family friendly .
this is so frustrating !
seating is far less plentiful than it should be .
get your act together .
there were n't any toilet seat covers .
this is by far the worst airport ever .
flew through here going to paris .
it was a terrible experience .
full of rotten people .
ugly nasty concourse e .
it 's out of date and feels like _num_ .
it 's pretty gross .
everything else is pretty bad .
tsa here is horrible .

however , arriving in clt is another story .
man , i hate this airport .
internet is very cheap and should be provided accordingly .

there 's no restaurant outside security except a starbucks .
oh wait this is charlotte nc , never mind .
worst airport i 've ever been through .
never connecting through charlotte again .
oh and the free wifi is horrible !
do n't be fooled .
very crowded , not a problem .
always so busy coming through here .
only redeeming thing was bojangles .
the workers however suck balls .
_num_ tries , _num_ mins each time .
confusing terminal approach and rental car return area .
worst wifi of any airport !
there are no teams here .
there are no overhead signs warning you of this .
horrible avoid the american terminal at all cost !
a small airport that needs some improvement .
the lines for security here are long .
there are n't many places to eat here .
i 'm not a big fan of this airport .
customer service : disappointing .
i just do n't have good experiences here .
security here is always a negative experience .
the airport environment feels very rushed and stressful .
this has been a terrible experience .
every restaurant closed at 10pm on a friday night .
only thing open is starbucks .
ca n't stay in terminal .
american airlines did n't tell people that .
i 'm sick and disgusted with you !
i do n't see this at any other airports .
on average , _num_ minutes .
and weather was not a problem at that point .
okay no big deal .
also , the flight was delayed ... how long ?
nah , just sit there and wait .
worst airport for baggage .
extremely slow for american on c terminal .
thanks for wasting _num_ minutes of my travel time .
the worst tsa experience !

the tsa at this airport is the worst !
they really need a customer service training .
get rid of the mens room bathroom attendants !
this is a terrible airport .
long term parking at clt is dreadful .
avoid connecting through charlotte at all costs .
is that really too much to ask ?
they said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich .
i said no , please , no tomatoes .
way too pricey for the chain .
avoid this place in the airport .
epic fail bk , clean up your act .
too much to expect at a fast food joint .
it 's a pig bucket of bk .
and no thanks or nothing .
not going back to this place .
the worst people i have seen in the business .
she is like you said no meat .
and her response was gold .
side order of buffalo chicken strips .
not a good choice for running between flights .
avoid the buffalo chicken , just get the plain .
it 's probably a better level of ordinary .
the order was $ _num_ for hash browns .
please do not eat there .
this is called no mayo .
couldnt give them zero stars .
that displeased me more than the disappointing food .
the only negative was the lack of trays .
by far the worst restaurant in the airport .
this one is terrible .
i can not even with that .
would give it _num_ stars if i could .
too bad _num_ stars is not an option here .
this place is so ghetto and trashy .
disgrace to the gay community !
do n't waste your time music out of date .
the combination kills it for you .
i was not impressed with her at all !
i had the spaghetti with italian sausage .

terrible greasy smelly cheesy food .
the worst pizza i have had .
it was around $ _num_ .
terrible customer service from manager .

i could n't tell the difference .
service fast but not friendly .
all i can say is yuk .
the salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce .
this place looks like it was frozen in _num_ .
this is not italian .

the food is horrible .
no one ate their entire meal .
no one took any left overs home .

everytime we attempt to come here they are closed .

the worst mcdonald 's i have ever experienced .
i 'll avoid this mcdonald 's at night .
they 're cheap in the fries .
so dirty i decided i could not eat here .
i 'll leave the odor to your imagination .
ppl w/ guns kill ppl .
no way would i ever go back .
not much , even in the used section .
a word of warning for customers here .
but wait , it gets worse .
the background check is only required for long guns .
i 've never been overly impressed with hyatt .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
needless to say , i would not recommend them .

i just want it right & this ordeal over !
i really thought they were much better than this .
there is no reason they ca n't be cleaned .
seriously folks , the bathrooms here are beyond nasty !
and points off for cutting out indoor smoking .
do n't get me wrong folks .
it was a waste of my money .

poor location and service .
they only good thing is the crowded airport van !

why not serve chocolate cake , cookies , mousse ?
the show was bad .
white rice was rice was fine .
not even good for an eight dollar lunch special .

i have never experienced that in any restaurant before .
needless to say this was not my favorite !
first time , last time .
the chicken was chewy and dry .
the french fries were barely warm either .
the biscuit was even small and dense .
not at all like other bojangles i have visited .
this location made bland , flavorless chicken .
they were not even that busy .
the service was n't good at all .
the manager was rude and not very accommodating .
my order has been consistently wrong here .
the service is rather poor .
seems management does n't care either ... .
the bun was firm like it was quite old .
the cheese was hardly melted .
probably the slowest drive-thru i 've ever experienced .
the sandwich looks like someone sat on it .
i did n't get a damn tomato .
con : they only accept cash .
the bill was $ _num_ .
i gave him a _num_ % tip .
what did he want _num_ % ?
odd , but probably the most efficient .
the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
there was no smoke flavor at all .
did it , wo n't do it again .
he does not know everything .
nothing special about anything , imo .
bbq sauce was n't good at all .
the sauce was too vinegary for my taste .
everyone else in my party said the same thing .
haha , i was being totally sarcastic .
oh my word it was horrible !
baked beans were from the can .
this place was not so good .
the bbq chicken was just ok .
complete failure the moment we arrived .
def wo n't be going back .
not like super cheap but the menu has variety .
the bun was soggy and gooey .
so frustrated with at & t 's horrible service !
something as simple as this still has not happened .
like i 'm supposed to be comfortable with that .
prepare for the worst when you move over there .
i guess it was cheap .
not returning anytime soon .
absolutely worst customer service for a hotel ever !
worst hotel experience i 've ever had !
poor management and extremely poor customer service !
the hotel staff itself was n't very welcoming .

fitness room only includes cardio .
breakfast was n't anything to look forward to .
the location and staff gives off bad vibes .
will was our driver .
very poor customer service in the contact lens department .

i 'm not sure which is worse .
i wo n't be back .
corporate has n't even tried to make things right .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
but recently getting really disgusting .

her fries are cold as are the nuggets .
the sprite is all soda no syrup .
the workers are just plain rude .
quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service .
i ca n't stand bad customer service .
they are hire incompetent morons .
they are hire incompetent morons .
so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .
extremely disappointed with this company .
not pleased at all with their professionalism .
new , clean but horrible service .
waited _num_ minutes for two breakfast sandwiches .
however , the food is definitely meh .
fries were a little soggy .
breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .
this is n't the first time either .
it was bland , nothing special at all .
really not much to say .
i will not be going back any time soon .
it was ok but nothing special for $ _num_ .
probably would not go again .
sorry , the food was just horrible .
but with each experience , i am less impressed .
what was left was less than 1/2 pound .
this place is as bland as they get .
the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too .
i was so sad .
will not be going back .
our waitress was absolutely horrible .
this particular location is pretty hit or miss .
just is n't the same , maybe they sold ?
_num_ stars only because the service was good .
the loaded baked potato was delicious .
i would n't bother to order it again .
and their garlic dressing is disgusting .
quality has went down as the price went up .
not worth going so much anymore .
that 's highly disgusting .
i was very unimpressed .
soggy chips with a good steak .
looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !
ca n't go wrong there .
so , i chose the omelette .
barely ate any of either serving .
pretty poor experience here .
nothing special and fairly expensive for what it was .
the waiter was very young and a bit clueless .
that was _num_ mins ago !
avoid at all costs if possible .
she was very helpful and knowledgeable .
please avoid this place .
is it me or does the customer service suck ?
this place seems like the opposite .
the chicken salad is made with turkey .
there was 1/4 lb .
i will not return to this place .
the cheesesteak was soggy .
the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .
what i received was just turkey .
the other 1/2 barely had more .
worst lunch experience of my life .
owners must suck every dime out of the business .
no empathy whatsoever about the situation .
staff is completely incompetent .
( lie # _num_ ) .
( lie # _num_ ) .
folks , stay away from this place .
the patient is not seen as an equal partner .
very hurt and upset with this business .
they could n't find any problem .
no response to my concerns .
the leasing office is racist .
i would never recommend living here .
rude staff , shitty attitudes and unprofessional .
no help at all .
it 's very dated and in need of remodeling .
there is no security cameras in the parking lot .
yeah this place is horrible .
waste and pet waste all over .
the pool is never clean .
the hot tub does n't work .
it really just is a crap place to live .
especially for a single lady i would seriously avoid .
our mild salsa never arrived .
i was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews .
the refried beans was like sauce .
the food did n't taste right .
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
service was extremely grumpy .
absolutely no excuse for that !
there are far better mexican restaurants in charlotte .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
what an awful experience i had with this salon .
she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .
that makes no sense .
she is a liar and unorganized .
very rude and unprofessional , let alone unnecessary .
what a waste of time .
unfortunately , it failed in less than one year .
it smelled and tasted awful .
their patient referral service is n't any better .
do n't go here - you will regret it .
horrible front desk service !
no letter , nothing !
do n't waste your time at this office .
this situation takes the icing of the cake though .
maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?
they lost my business for good .
i know i should have called beforehand .
i felt like this one waitress was very rude .
service : confused but trying to be helpful .
customer service is lacking .
really this place just needs to be more hospitable .
we also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi .
we have not been back .
they need better selections in sushi .
also , if you do n't tip enough .
arrived , party of _num_ on a wednesday night .
not authentic at all .
i was very unimpressed .
neither were anything special .
was not good at all .
the sushi was mediocre at best .
never know sashimi can be this bad .
worst sashimi experience ever .
the table was also sticky and gross !
i was not impressed and will never go back !
none would make eye contact or acknowledge my presence .
looks like very other cvs .
unfortunately i usually come here for the pharmacy .
they are so slow and are not any help .
the wait time to check out is absurd .
oh no , same lady still at the register .
i understand that everyone has bad days .
am i missing something ?
and the gym was okay but nothing special .
do n't move here this place is horrible !
there is something always wrong with the apartment .
the worst apartment i 've ever lived in !
if you are thinking of renting here do n't !
they have `` lost my security deposit '' !
lease has me listed in wrong apt .
the biggest thing is they lost the money !
run , do n't walk from this place !
biggest mistake i ever made !
never have i heard of this being done elsewhere .
of course nothing happened on monday .
no one seems to be communication for efficiency .
all they want is your money !
no , thank you .
d & d is expensive .
i ca n't believe it .
it pains me to write this review !
bar was empty sans a handful of people .
sat outside for _num_ min with no service .
waitress showed up _num_ min later .
what a horrible experience .
just opened them up an poured .
neither of what we wanted when i said sweet .
we were not going to buy anything else .
bill came to $ _num_ .
wine prices even higher than paris or london .
the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .
i grew up going to the south park location .
hence why i needed the coffee .
there were only three other tables in the restaurant .
no excuse for this .
so this should n't be happening .
they did n't even deserve a one star .
no way will they get away with this .
i 'm terrified of those things .
horrible place to live !
i 'm beyond disgusted .
perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup .
gross , what happened ?
this last time there was pure disappointment .
it was way too salty !
my daughter who picked it up had to leave .
too bad , i hope they change cooks .
this is a waste of time and money .
it had no spice or bite at all .
years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .
the service is incredibly slow .
waiter was loud and too casual .
sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .
they sent _num_ to a table of two .
wo n't be back .
it takes money to keep the engine running .
what is really bad is the service .
well , that 's not entirely true .
but the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous .
another bad experience two times in a row .
maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .
here , however , i have received nothing .
looks like they are having staffing problems .
the service was not so great .
he did n't deserve more than _num_ % .
the menu changes are n't necessarily better .
so salty i ate one and threw them out .
worst mother 's day experience ever .
the wait time quote was an hour _num_ minutes .
the _num_ month old is not happy .
from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .
she did n't seem to care at all either .
tried again today with my husband , nope .
very disappointing experience recently .
very poor experience no one accepts responsibility .
when did this place get expensive ?
small portions and pricey lunch .
oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible .
the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .
even the stupid fortune cookies were stale .
i could not put another bite in my mouth .
it made me sick .
returned with smiles and no hassle .
it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .
_num_ employees confirmed no more waters in back .
i do n't understand the hype for this place .
will not come back .
eh , went here on christmas for dinner .
wine was outrageously overpriced .
been there _num_ times .
not a big fan .
i was very , very disappointed in this place .
our waitress was also terrible .
do n't waste your money .
the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .
we asked ... should we get out own menus ?
i just could n't believe a _num_ oz .
so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .
up to ~ $ _num_ ) .
and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak .
desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
it was so burnt as to be charred .
way overpriced and not worth the trip !
noisy , noisy bar !
it just was n't that good .
i will not be back !
just ca n't see it for the money .
not impressed with the food .
in fact , it is barely even memorable .
ok food , not too exceptional .
not to return , i am afraid .
the dumplings were just okay .
waited a long time to try this place .
however , the food was borderline bad .
the chicken itself was mediocre at best .
the replacement order was poorly made and rushed .
i was highly disappointed .
this is the worst experience ever .
it is jessica fault !
give me a break !
this is the last time i visit this establishment .
i do not get it .
why does this place get voted best breakfast ?
tried again today and were again sorely disappointed .
it 's like no one cared any more .
the manager could n't have cared less .
not so much here .
i 'm not going to finish it .
hell , i may not even last _num_ bites .
you ca n't eat pancakes with your hand .
speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .
then i realized they serve royal cup coffee .
apparently , the management at oph hates their customers .
she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .
i was n't too impressed with my visit here .
pancakes and bacon horrible .
the chicken sandwich i ordered was awful .
the layout is terrible !
once again , horrible customer service !
what a complete waste of time .
terrible customer service at the cafe over the weekend .
also they had problems with their soda machine .
he never spoke to a single black customer .
the atmosphere is less friendly .
a little more pricey but it caught my eye .
except maybe on small business saturday .
i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .
i wo n't be going back .
can i rate less than a star ?
so we got up and walked out .
not fair to the customer at all .
later i am still dealing with their screw ups .
wow , were has customer service gone ?
walked in and no one never said hello .
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
overly expensive attorney who will not deliver any results !

typical south side snob crap .
california rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland .
gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed .
while tasty , the portions are small .

they had n't been cleaned properly .
this place is a total disappointment .
the food was very disappointing .
the goat cheese was nowhere to be found .
the french toast tapas was mediocre .
( i do n't eat shrimp . )

the company was very unprofessional and rude .
it was a disaster , a horrible experience .

the service was awful .
much better pizza even if they do n't deliver .
this particular location has really let me down !

poor experience at pick up .
highly disappointed all around .
i am in search of a new salon definitely !
if i could give negative stars , i would .
i 'm not kidding .
worst pedicure and gel manicure ever !
it just wasnt enough food for the price .
the rest of the experience was kind of bizarre .
here 's where things got a little weird .
this place was garbage for hookah .
it was not worth the original _num_ dollars charged .

he is clearly as mad as i am .
this place is not that fast ... .
food is n't very good - service is worse .
crab rangoon is soggy .
egg rolls are greasy and flavorless .
we ca n't wait till our lease is up !
do n't waste your time or money .
the apartments are n't terrible just not great .
however , i never like my food !
it is always greasy and flavorless .
a little incompetence i can deal with .
has it come to reviewing fast food joints ?
anywho , it went a little something like this .
that 's not good when you 're ordering food .
personal hygiene was n't on the menu that night !
i asked for my money back and left .
the fries were soggy and cold .
the last two pair did n't come out right .
however , they have let themselves go downhill .
it was too late .
still no email quote .
i would stay away from these shady dealers .
the advertised prices were _num_ .
that did n't work so we took it back .
they are dishonest and their customer service is terrible .
oh , gee , they did n't realize that !
ca n't mess that up right ?

everything that should 've been done is handled miss .
i will not be returning to this location .
the rest was mediocre .
the rice was plain , edible with soy sauce .
smh worst service every ... .
the sesame chicken sucks .
their chicken wings are so tasteless .
they probably just fry it plain .
do n't waste your time here .
like i mean seriously drive past this place .
the service was not very good .
recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .
they even charge you $ _num_ for ice water !
avoid at all costs !
lots of things were bad here .
this was n't during peak hours .
the hamburger steak was ok .
the squash was flavorless .
my bf said his shrimp was ok at best .
_num_ stars was being generous .

no offer to comp food and no apology .
would not recommend this restaurant to anyone !
our service was slow .

the environment did n't seem the cleanest .

third problem : they gave us no inspection paperwork .
consider this your fair warning .
_num_ words : unorganized chaos .
one of the worst rental experiences of my life .
next time it avis or anyone else beside hertz .

do n't waste your money or time here .
the absolute worst customer service .
the food was bad !
way too salty , cheese tasted like crap .
the service was pitiful !
the chips were all broken and stale .
nothing special about it .
the guacamole was tasteless and frozen , previously made .
nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .
i was disappointed the second time .
not sure if i would go back .
this place is a joke at best .
totally reminded me of a mexican soup nazi attitude !
the food was horrible not authentic mexican restaurant .
tried this place tonight after reading the reviews .
salsa was just okay .
staff was not friendly .
this is not one of them .
-the bathroom could use some soap and paper towels .
very annoyed with this place .
would have been almost enjoyable if there was service .
got my order wrong .
not as good as i used to come before .
i will not eat here again .
that would mostly considered as cheap customers .
but overall , do n't bother with this hole-in-the-wall .
do n't go there ... ... run away !
stick with cold subs .
what we had was just okay -- but barely .
would 've taken _num_ min .
i could go on forever .
gross , gross , gross !
then there was no elevators .
secondly , this place stinks and everything looks nasty !
the bathtub was extremely dirty .
no apology , no action thus far .
all cities are not the same .
the tv is outdated and old .
the number of channels is limited .
i recently stayed here through priceline .
i was pretty disappointed .
i felt terrible for this woman .
a/c unit was very loud .
this hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere .
also , our damn room key would never work !
this place does n't deserve the business .
cleanliness is not a priority here .
hotwire is the reason for all my problems .
we stayed a week for a conference .
the bathrooms are a little small .
for the record ... its not worth $ _num_ .
toilet paper is cheap .
no microwave in room .
second night here the free wifi was not working .

they 've got _num_ types to choose from .
in my opinion , do your shopping elsewhere .
i could n't finish it .
both were completely flavorless .
not to mention the price was about $ _num_ .
we will not be back to this location .

the rice was flavorless .
i did n't finish my food .
i threw the entire box away .
and you do n't even deserve that !
the bbq was cold and dry .
it just was n't that good .
they may ask you where the food came from ?
we drove a long drive to try this bbq .
the food came out cold and not fresh .
the server is clueless .
the ribs themselves are not good .
what saved them was the bbq sauce .
sauce again the thin eastern style .
and i did n't have as many side choices ?
it smells like an elderly persons home .
no bacon in the green beans ?
probably the worst bbq food i 've ever had .
i do n't know how else to put it .
but if you can avoid it , you should .
you 're giving nc bbq a bad rep .
their policy is `` no teams '' .
none of these _num_ parents will ever return .
just do n't walk in as a large group .
the place was empty .
do n't waste your time .
poor service , screwed up orders .
i 'd suggest finding bbq elsewhere .
guy would n't stop talking to us .
we will not be back .
everyone else is below average .
i really hate that !

i would n't recommend this place .

i feel dirty just being here .
c. incompetent `` maintenance '' personnel .
e. no apology or compensation .
i am totally appalled that this would happen .
avoid bad service and disappointment .
do n't waste your time .
overpriced low quality hibachi .
i however made the mistake of staying .
take your money elsewhere .
have not been to this location in awhile .
i was very disappointed .
did not look like the menu pic .
ca n't believe that they serve us that .
not a fan of this location .
i 'm never coming back to a denny 's .
if i could give zero stars then i would .
awful service , poor attitude , poor food quality .
i ordered an avocado chicken caesar salad .
i assumed i was covered for my next refill .
the service is terrible .
instead , i got nothing .
terrible showroom from _num_ .
poor attitude by employee .
no greeting , no offer of assistance .
i will not purchase with this company .
i do not like this company .
ordered my pizza tonight via website .
when order came , plain cheese pizza .
this is the worst pizza store in charlotte .
do n't waste your money .
ruined our panthers football game !
never ordering from pizza hut again .
did n't expect much from pizza hut .
avoid like the plague !
i ca n't rate it at zero stars ...
wish i could give this negative _num_ stars .
unbelievable that they 're still in business .
i should have stayed home and made pizza myself .
it has been _num_ .
sigh ... never ordering from them again .
often answers the orders totally lacks something .
the highlight of the meal actually was dessert .
on the whole , a major disappointment .
spinach side was a little bitter .
needless to say , we did not stay .
if i could give zero stars i would .
staff was nice , pedicure was horrible .
it seriously looked like a little kid did it .
stopped by tonight with a friend .
i returned my beer and ordered a draft .
it 's wrong again .
my husband did not care for his meal either .
how can you mess up a hot dog ?
the food was mediocre , except the salmon .
high prices , watered down drinks , impersonal management .
it was way better !
it 's like a bad applebee 's .
then again - the place is creepy .
this location is n't consistent .
i ca n't stand it .
i 'm not a fan .
the associates are slow and rude .
i just felt like i was being questioned .
ordered _num_ burgers and a soda .
i have no one to blame but myself .
the service here is almost always terrible .
your lucky to get a _num_ out of _num_ !
this location was completely overcrowded and dirty .
the employees were not kind or helpful .
we will not be back .
the service pretty much sucked .
it tasted old and not very sweet .
pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there .
they probably wo n't get my business again !
no apology , just want some different chicken ?
got my money back and left .
slowest drive thru in the whole world .
but typical for the entire bojangles chain .
drive thru too damn slow !
this place is terrible !
there was already a car waiting .
this one is poorly run .
her response , i 'm waiting on biscuits .
it was terrible , terrible service .
and it 's pretty gross inside .
the service was friendly and the beer is cold .
the chicken & rice soup was pretty bland .
absolutely the worst bar i 've been to .
trashy , nasty and extremely rude staff .
will not be returning .
no class at this place .
things sure went downhill after that !
and that is just annoying .
the bathrooms are still disgusting .
the drinks are so weak it 's appalling .
do n't try to pretend you 're something else .
the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !
i said no fries and naked tenders means grilled .
so no i wo n't be going back .
i quickly changed my order to buffalo wings .
overall , not worth it .
same dcor which we like but a new menu .
menu description is poor though .
a little uncomfortable but no problem .
i do n't care how good your food is .
oh wan fu , you were a big disappointment .
it was very rude .
they had no idea how long it would take .
the food was bland .
hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .
the food is terrible .
its downright awful and has been for awhile .
and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .
it was an awful experience .
i wasted my gas and my time .
staff is rude & snotty with `` comments '' .
she told me it would be _num_ minutes .
very poor service and i was completely unimpressed .
`` kelly '' is rude .
needless to say i will not be going back .
total waste of money !
this place is empty .
apparently they do n't like business .
no way will i be back any time soon .
the line was endless and crowded .
i was n't all that impressed with it .
my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .
the second bite was stringy steak .
overall it was n't a bad sandwich at all .
oven was n't working so no pizzas available .
over priced for average , below average food .
i am sure i will not be returning .
the biggest rip-off ever .
the doctor said it was nothing .
i agreed and scheduled the surgery for wednesday .
not a _num_ % credit .
unfortunately that is where the good news stops !
a rip off of you ask me .
we also have a horrible neighbor problem .
didnt really seem like the cared either .
no one came to check the unit for mold .
they ca n't seem to tell me anything .
i just want to be done with these apartments .
i shrugged it off and called maintenance .
they did n't even fix it .
i 'm sorry , what ?
do n't sign a lease with these jerks .
ultimately you will get screwed over .
literally the worst apartment complex .
_num_ weeks later and nothing has been done .
the huge problem is the teppanyaki ... just awful .
i ate there over the christmas holidays .
- the chicken was so salty it was inedible .
the food was awful and the presentation was worse .
it 's really gone downhill .
they definately wo n't be getting my business again !
average japanese steakhouse experience .
i wo n't be back .
that stuff is nasty .
i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .
that is not cool .
the place was shabby and the floor was filthy .
he could n't save the day , though .
i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .
i just know better sushi places .
probably will only go back for take out .
so not worth it .
staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .
we will never go back here sadly .
it was very unprofessional .
the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .
they never bothered to refill the bread basket .
the chicken curry was passable .
chicken tikka masala was below average .
the only thing they bothered to refill was water .
the overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing .
but starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill .
serving is bad and avoid this restaurant .
- lamb kabobs - undercooked and falling apart .
a big f for this .
in my opinion , a waste of money .
service was average to bad .
food quality left a lot to be improved .
meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy .
i was a bit disappointed in the selection .
food has never made me feel that way .
no spices or raisin and naan .
worst indian food i have ever eat in us .
saw a huge roach on the wall .
wish i could give it less .
ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets .
only _num_ other _num_ person tables there .
do n't say i did n't tell you so .
anyway i 'm sure they will be closed soon .
i just came from lunch with coworkers here .
probably all the same sauce anyway .
shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer .
and now i 'm craving fortune cookie .
i 'm so sad right now .
well everything was kinda disappointing .
no bueno , not for me .
next time ill pass .
cold , hard and greasy .
i know they just walked in ahead of me .
the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .
the egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt .
so they great wall is not so great .
maybe just have some soup for lunch .
never have experienced anything like this before !
i wo n't be back .
so we ate our apps and still no one .
had to wait forever for our check .
the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons .
there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever .
no idea why this place was full .
this place is bad !
the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup !
such a waste of money and time.
worst chinese food ever !
the food however was not .
okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting .
the hot and sour soup is exactly that .
i wo n't get another certificate for this restaurant .
mainly because the service was horrible .
which was n't deserved at all .
and that 's not what we got .
no wonder they are on groupon !
nothing stood out about them whatsoever .
the onion pancake was incredibly dry .
poor service and okay food .
nothing special to write about .
went back yesterday after passing over for several years .
used to be one of my favorite places .
the sesame chicken was terrible .
and honestly there is nothing special here .
the food is seriously lacking .
my hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor .
it was all so blah .
so i only ordered lunch .
first no spoon or soy sauce .
then the egg roll was soggy .
they did not even cook it fresh .
it was so bad .
the egg drop soup had no flavor either .
thanks but no thanks !
i have not been back .
went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .
the same or better is available elsewhere .
it should be thicker than what i ate .
beef pieces were small .
overall the portion to price ratio is poor .
duck curry was okay .
fried shrimps were below average .
i would not recommend to visit second time .
i 'm not a fan really .
_num_ for beef basil ?
it was a big disappointment !
the service here is horrible !
big disappointment on that dish .
i ate it just because i was hungry .
the decor in the restaurant was nice though .
not likely to try again though .
secondly , it was not that great .
it was mediocre curry at best .
so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .
i did n't save the leftovers .
my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .
the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
the pad thai itself was really disappointing .
waited _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
below average and i will not return .
like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .
when all else fails this place was so reliable .
not anymore i guess .
it tasted exactly like watered down ketchup .
went tonight and ordered pad thai .
in its place was a watered down ketchup sauce .
we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .
not impressed , left hungry .
she was slow , rude , and incompetent .
i will not be back to this clinic again .
this is by far the worst .
i 'm actually sorry i ever even ate there .
i will not be back !
because that was the rude person taking my order .
then i was confused .
just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !
got shrimp with mixed vegetables .
will not be going back .
hot and sour soup was bland .
crispy noodles were stale .
certainly will not return to quick wok .
i was very disappointed in the food here .
the food is actually fairly mediocre .
i am going to give up on lowes .
it was an overall bad experience here .
the service was slow and the food was tasteless .
i would probably not return here .
if i wanted to i could buy this place .
today however i think was not a great experience .
just spent $ _num_ for two people at lunch .
cost was $ _num_ .
looked nothing like the picture .
wo n't be doing lunch here again .
our entrees arrived about _num_ minutes after the salad .
it was over cooked and tasteless .
this time was n't so great .
the pickles came out fast and were very hot .
slowest server i have ever had .
i am so disappointed .
poor service , especially during slow times .
avoid this place if you value your health !
the fries were horrible .
i 'm not even sure where to start .
park _num_ cafe is under new management .
well scratch the quick now .
as usual it was mediocre at best .
you no longer deserve my business .
this was an awful experience .
bad food , horrible service .
very busy place for rather mediocre food .
the salad dressing was okay , but missing something .
the meat itself did not taste good .
i only ate about three bites .
it was very watery and bland : ( .
i can not imagine complaints about portion size !
moderately busy , but seated right away .
wo n't be returning .
you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .
then the chef comes out to rush us .
large portions of noodles and vegetables .
that is just wrong .
it 's not very good .
did i mention the hostesses were rude ?
too expensive for what you get .
a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .
the server and chef were very efficient and personable .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
wo n't go back .
( repeat , repeat .
so i left -- for good .
i refused to eat while my companion 's ate .
across the board , the dishes were flavorless .
could n't be further from the truth .
i was really disappointed in this place .
it did n't even taste like pad thai .
i will not be coming back here .
again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither .
vegetarian lunch was bland .
it did n't get any better with salt .
the decor was outdated and looked drab .
i was greatly disappointed when it arrived .
i would n't recommend this restaurant .
other than that , i would not recommend .
a takeout place in a supermarket ?
i 've never lucked out here .
it 's so crammed and so messy .
service was not in any rush .
so rude and painfully slow .
as politely as i could .
they have me a baked potato .
she ended up paying $ _num_ .
worst customer experience of my life .
i denied the managers offer to send it back .
sad too i used to love outback .
it 's a real shame .
the shrimp was just gross .
i order sirloin and grilled prawns .
the guy waiter was not much nicer .
this outback is horrible .
this is the absolute worst outback .
it has cheese fries added to it .
i could 've said yellow for all she cared .
however , they were very shady at the end .
first off , a heads up .
the service was slow .
i would not recommend uptown retreat .
i do n't like being lied to .
the real problem was the hair cut .
it was a disaster .
my largest complaint is the cut it is awful !
i made a huge mistake .
not something i 'd regularly do .
the caribou associates know how to treat customers .
she offered no apology or solution .
wow , this thing is horrible .
they 're tasty and pretty cheap .
bottom line : _num_ for _num_ bucks !
still not worth it !
i made zero errors .
there was nothing left they could check .
i do n't get it .
i wish i had done the same .
but : concessions are a complete rip-off .
i have n't been back here in years .
the food is mediocre at best .
the rice was bland and slightly overcooked .
not the best mexican restaurant .
avoid if you can .
the food is bland and boring .
the food is quite bland .
i ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese .
there was no seasoning , or none noticeable .
chips are obviously from bags .
salsa were runny and definitely not spicy .
the rice was bland .
overall , it was just disappointing !
i used to like it alot .
terrible food , service always rushed .
the food is greasy and tasteless .
tasted bland and watered down to me .
i could n't even eat them .
there was lettuce and guac on the side .
the beans were beans , nothing special .
possibly the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
tacos were cold , soggy and tasted microwaved .
my main course was n't much better .
my family visited the restaurant recently .
customer service was horrible .
the fajita chimichanga tasted like chinese food .
wasted time and time , no compensation .
no bill no nothing .
so dissapointed ( as are neighbors of ours ) .
it was $ _num_ after tax .
i wo n't give it just one star though .
there are some positives .
will not go back .
do not waste your money !
it was just terrible .
above all , it was incredibly dirty in there !
we will not be back .
but this place deserves the _num_ stars .
maintenance takes weeks to fix things .
prices are n't great for what you 're getting .
would not recommend to a friend .
rip off apartment complex .
do not rent here .
horrible place to live .
worst place to live !
they also run out of sweet tea a lot .
i really tried to like this place .
worst italian food i have ever eaten .
i could barely eat one .
it was dry and tasteless .
it was sooooo soggy on the bottom .
the food 's presentation was awful .
i wish i could give it zero stars .
had the worst italian food ever ... ... .
pity as i like to support the local businesses .
marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet .
italian sausage was bland at best .
wine selection was average and overpriced .
they ca n't make an authentic antipasto .
they ca n't cook pasta .
the place just sucked .
obviously frozen product , blah .
big disappointment was received .
do n't waste your time coming here .
he never gave me the full total .
he gave me a more reasonable price .
they took to long ... bad customer service .
they charge alot to have such bad customer service .
never go back there again .
i did n't like there attitude an customer service .
how can i describe my experience here ?
their chips and salsa is bad .
the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .
even the cocktail sauce was bad .
do i deserve this ?
i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?
for the price , the food was awful .
there were dirty plates and cups everywhere .
the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .
it was like oil on oil .
the biscuit itself was ok .
but i would not go there for breakfast .
quite frankly , i was a bit sad .
1st it reeks of cigarettes .
i 'm glad i did n't fill the prescription .
same practice same reason double the amount .
i do n't get it .
i want to know what fool made this decision .
i would n't be surprised to see it close .
but this restaurant was not clean .
the floors had trash all over them .
i wo n't come back to this location .
service is poor especially for pick up orders .
there 's a $ _num_ ( ? )
but it 's not old , either .
terribly , terribly thin .
do not stay here .
are you kidding me ?
avoid this place at all costs .
i do n't know why i come here .
the worst walgreens in the history of walgreens .
this walgreens is dreadful to go to .
i switched drug stores immediately after this experience .
the old location would usually be moderately busy .
but not like it is now .
they are usually friendly though .
i just dont know what it is .
no , he would n't have .
ok , i just ate a science project .
check-in at the hilton university place was a breeze .
unfortunately , that is about where the good ended .
the restaurant was completely empty .
after almost _num_ minutes , the food arrived .
i sent back the flatbread .
she was more than gracious and apologetic .
_num_ minutes later , she arrived .
this level of noise makes sleep difficult .
as for the food , it was just okay .
never insult someone 's children .
i walked into the store looking for yellow flowers .
very short and not paying attention to me .
obviously this is insane .
not much else to say .
they also keep soap in a locked display .
this makes no sense .
wo n't even let you float on your back .
there are better and worse y 's for sure .
its close , so this is where i go .
will not stay here again !
surly staff that was never at the desk .
run away from this property as quickly as possible !
made a reservation in june for july .
this property has gotten very tired .
the place was not even that busy .
but the service was bad .
bad service gets the same .
sorry , but this site may disappoint .

worst service i have ever had .
it 's soup and a wedge salad .
no bacon and barely any toppings .
we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .

the furniture is worn and dirty .
the room smelled like an ash tray .
i can not trust them .
i do not recommend .
they were rude and the room was n't clean .
this place is a nightmare .
the price is appealing but not worth it .

then they brought out my fried rice .
it was n't the display chef 's fault !
i would not recommend this hibachi .
maybe i came on a bad night ?
nasty , hate this place .
busy is not an excuse for under cooked food .
way to keep business drew .
my last visit they ran out of shopping carts .
i am not kidding - this is no joke .
when i walked up everyone was busy with customers .
it was actually painfully slow .
another associate handled the actual exchange transaction .
more business than they wish to handle .
it certainly was not me .

it was covered with chopped green herbs .
my wife got mama 's trio .
she did n't really care for any of it .
the worst macaroni grill i 've ever been to !
do not waste your time !
this was a disappointment .
their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?
a poached egg on top ?
not the way to do it .
besides , the egg pasta was too thick .
do not waste your money .
i would n't get it again .
worst dining experience ever .
_num_ minutes in , finally takes our damn order .

and it tasted so microwaved .
pasta was ok but too greasy .
please avoid this restaurant !
it is not worth the time or money .

our drink order was also forgotten .
do n't bother with this place .
first , our waitress went missing a few times .
the manager brought out our food but never apologized .
she was very apologetic .
our other sandwiches were just as disappointing .
just another chain food restaurant .
i long for a real deli in charlotte !
food was meh , nothing special .
so i made sure the door was locked .
we only stayed one night and went back home .
do not trust this days in .
you do n't get to see the room .
all i got was a smoking room .
went back and changed and got another smokers room .
do not trust this days in .
they stole my money .
the room is not worth _num_ bucks .
it 's not worth _num_ bucks .
do n't waste your time or money .
so do n't take my word .
why would they say _num_ mins lose refund .
it 's that bad !
do n't trust this pace .
same price and so much better .
room was n't completely clean either .
found food and trash in the refrigerator .
the breakfast was weak .
it was a pretty bad experience .
expansive menu from italian to greek , even mexican !
portion large enough for _num_ meals .
you better off staying in a roach motel .
there was no hot water for _num_ days .
i would not stay here again .
do not waste your money here .
they are also not very flexible .
they 're also very expensive .
small dogs may be different .

way too long , for something so simple .
very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital .
i will not be going back !
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
they do n't seem to care too much .
i am so stressed out and very worried .
the rest of us gave up and left .
i give this place zero stars .
i am extremely disappointed .
very disappointed in this place .
the food was cold both times .
way too much money for the wrong stuff !
ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold .
wing sauce was spilled all over bag .
they deserve zero stars .
big mistake because he did n't check the food .
the tenders had no seasoning on them .
there was nothing to dip my celery in .
very comparable to have an entree and _num_ sides .
i 'm so glad we split it .
would n't recommend it at all .
the food was just mediocre .
the bartender was the worst experience of the night .
extremely inattentive , uninterested and not warm .
i was immediately disgusted .
i assume she was the general manager .
oh and drinks for lunch are very expensive !
$ _num_ for a lemonade !
i can not recommend this facility .
do not go to this car wash .
this location was no different .
buy their upgrades and it is a waste .
i 'm not that impressed .
i wo n't be back .
will not go back .
inspection slow and unprofessional .
left my car dirty and smelling of cigarettes .
ordered _num_ gallon of sweet tea .
it was cold and old food .
ghetto staff means lack of caring !
never had a problem at this one until today .
not something you just feel like free styling .
i could n't eat it after the first piece .
bland $ _num_ of waste !
on average probably twice a month .
but hey , that 's just me .
his reply was that he did n't see it .
it 's the execution that lacks .
luckily i do n't mind coke ... .
i really have no idea what it is .
the dining room always looks closed .
i wo n't be going back .
at this point i was angry .
pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !
chicken was way over cooked .
i really wish i could rate the complex individually .
they are incompetent with their jobs .
stop apologizing and fix the problem !
shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever .
*** this place is horrible !
my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .
the sandwich itself was mediocre .
not my ideal chicken parm !
no problem , they included tax .
umm , why the double tax ?
this place is gross .
very old and very run down .
staff friendly and all but the place looks dirty .
these people rip you off !
she looked at my shirts .
had a _num_ month old shirt cleaned here .
just got a shirt destroyed there .
no offer of apology or credit .
hardly worthy of mention here a decade later .
food was not good on three occasions .
my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt .
no stars would be correct .
she said she would get it changed .
it 's sad that the food is so bad .
i would rate a _num_ .
bottom line is , do n't do it .
just does n't cut it .
advertised as italian , olive garden should be offended .
did not stick around to argue .
do n't waste your money .
i did n't eat it .
that 's $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .
the service was terrible .
the food is barely passable .
did n't like it !
sorry but you guys deserve a _num_ .
service was slow and the restaurant was not crowded .
ordered the lasagna and got mush instead .
wo n't be visiting there again .
our waitress was very friendly but slow .
food is over priced and not very good .
it was overcooked and turned gray .
as a result they came out overcooked .
they were not seasoned well .
a good steak never requires steak sauce .
_num_ ) the food was lackluster .
and the breakfast is n't very good at all .
i 'm just not impressed with their breakfast .
they were burnt and cooked down to nothing .
honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me .
however , here is how they contacted me .
it 's not worth it .
poor results and questionable billing .
requested a meeting and no one showed up .
they will not communicate with a simple phone call .
the produce was n't always kept up well either .
i left _num_ minutes after arrival .
never ever will i order from here again .
this place is overrated .
no big deal for my me or my wallet .
but it left a bad taste in my mouth .
not a word in _num_ months .
i 've walked in to make purchases .
i 'm usually met with `` next register .
no one seems to care .
this is really frustrating .
overpriced and my muffin was stale .
will not go again .
really , not good .
i was so disappointed .
strange looking , and bad tasting .
not good at all .
so that was a strange start .
please do not see this vet .
this place is terrible .
so she is choosing one paying customer over another .
i payed $ _num_ for a large cheese pizza .
the pizza now is just ok .
unfortunately , i was let down .
i was told _num_ min .
well _num_ turned into _num_ .
but it 's not great .
it took _num_ hours and our pizza was cold .
the service is awful .
that 's not how i ordered it .
the parking lot is a bit weird to access .
i did n't check the bathrooms .
i will never be back .
employees are unbelievably rude most of the time .
however , the doors are closed and locked shut .
no frills , but not expensive either .
not at all impressed .
yes bar - no one under _num_ allowed .
really only space for our 5th wheel .
_num_ minutes later , they appeared .
my wife 's veggie sandwich was very plain .
the food sucks and we will not return .

( _num_ ) cleanliness .
( _num_ ) lack of amenities .
i did n't see many family during our stay !
_num_ more minutes and finally someone came up front .
they checked me into someone else 's room .
avoid this place at all costs .
still no contact from the general manager !
the room was clean and the air was cold .
i would def look elsewhere before i booked here .
not good kinda left feeling sick .
nothing about the visit stands out to me .
i probably would not go back .
luckily for me , i live in rock hill .
secondly , there were ants everywhere !
plus , no free wifi !
eggplant parm was salty .
veal parm was tough and so thin .
the breading was thicker than the veal .
i would not recommend at all .
i will not return , terrible customer service .
she understood but it was the owners call .
and the pizza was n't good .
went for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed .
it 's a shame .
i have had better and i have had worse .
the guacamole is always bland .
the salsa , although bland , was surprisingly spicy .
becky noticed it too .
not much in the way of flavor though .
chili verde was ok but not worth $ _num_ .
i will never go back into this establishment again .
rude customer service in beer section .
it was an expensive craft beer .
the vendor did n't stock your shelves , fool !
just want people to understand truth in advertising .
would not suggest this place to anyone .
for a destination dinner , i think not .
this place has went downhill bad .
the food is pretty mediocre .
it is only for people sitting at the bar .
not good for food .
the food was terrible .
the wait staff was helpful and service was quick .
appetizer , hot wings , were mediocre at best .
not hot and sorta greasy .
i went to this place probably _num_ years ago .
was not impressed then .
i ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting .
wo n't be coming back .
food just is n't great , never has been .
do not waste $ $ on food !
you 've been warned !
tonight was the worst in service and food .
the slaw came and was awful .
this place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately .
i am sad to see it go down hill .
tonight was a miserable time here .
without fail its always the same .
poor to standard food .
today was the worst , though .
i felt bad for the hostess .
gone downhill from the last time i was here .
turned out to be a big disappointment .
french fries were under cooked .
we never lacked for anything .
had two very disappointing dinners here .
our waitress was nice but not very professional .
chicken was dry and the portions were tiny !
the wrong people are running it .
certainly will not be back !
it could be so much better .
really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is .
went for sunday brunch and was very disappointed .
worst thing was the loud dance music .
horrible experience and not worth the money .
the service was incredibly slow .
decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .
but i wo n't be back .
this place is a waste of time .
that was pretty lame .
my husband was so confused with his sandwich .
but the food is horrible .
every appetizer and main dish is horrible .
beer selection is better in my house .
cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced .
service was just ok .
tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .
the chili was tasteless .
the bun was tasteless .
bad all the way around .
pitiful excuse for a restaurant .
no leadership in this place .
the food looks like my patients vomit .
food is hit or miss -- usually , miss .
food was not very good either .
never checked on , offered additional drinks or dessert .
no apologies for uncooked food !
unfortunately it 's not one of my favorites .
no smile , no hi , nothing .
just not my kind of place .
it was hot - very uncomfortable - inside .
it was loud - very loud - as usual .
the owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up .
the food is n't very good at all .
we really did n't care where we sat .
it is not a family restaurant .
we wo n't be going back .
chicken wings where not hot .
a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks .
it just did n't add up .
the queso dip was cold & thick .
the food was very mediocre .
i will never spend another dime here .
too salty to finish .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
last time i ate there was the last time .
mushy , times before food was much better .

i made the mistake of sending mine back .
needless to say , i will not return .
inconsistent service but food is good .
i could n't chew the steak .
i did n't want to talk to the manager .
his ribs were refrigerator cold .
i 've already taken the meal off . ''
our visit on may _num_ was less than stellar .
only came back once to fill our drinks .
will not be back .
what an obnoxious , customer unfriendly person .
i would n't even give this place one star .
we use to like this facility very much .
ok for _num_ night stay .
couple running it were very friendly .
biggest peeve is grass not kept .
the worst service and pizza .
they delivered pizza with the wrong toppings .
horrible management and pizza .
the fries were horrible .
they looked like little fat cigarettes !
i had deep fried batter for lunch !
the restaurant was probably half full of people .
someone else brought us water tho .
nothing much to it at all .
the taste was mediocre .
my co-worker said the omelette was ok .
service was slow and good was ehh .
would not go hear again .
and they taste like cooking oil .
cheese curds , i 've had better .
the produce quality was not very good .
produce could use a makeover .
can we please have a new grocery store already ?
the prices , however , are my biggest beef .
transfer _num_ , to sales !
transfer _num_ , to the internet !
transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !
there should be a negative rating on here .
it 's not theirs to make sure it work .
that is how much i hate them .
avoid this company like the plague .
needs more books and homeless people .
waitress amber was courteous and attentive .
if true i am disappointed , al .
long story short very disappointed with service and food .
i wo n't be back .
the food was barely warm .
maybe someone gave our order to another customer .
he requested his money back .
people walked in after us and were seated .
i will not be back .
the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .
but still way way too crowded .
then someone came over and said hi .
so she then tried to help things along .
she was rude and careless .
too bad because the beer was nice and cold .
there were n't many patrons in the dining room .
needless to say , i will not be returning .
ate there last night with a group of friends .
it was cold and tasted very old .
now , not worth the salt .
we had a horrible experience here last summer .
wait staff is not trained .
i was there on monday december _num_ , _num_ .
no one was there .
i waited another _num_ minutes .
tried this because it 's local .
terrible , bland chinese food .
not much else to say .
no , i just got home .
no offer of a refund .
the meal was very disappointing to say the least .
took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed .
the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .
even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce .
the calamari was not tough .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
the service was also slow .
i wo n't be going back .
the entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par .
the staff was very kind but a little annoying .
that was $ _num_ wasted .
how do you mess up beef fried rice ?
there was hardly any meat to be had .
all in all an extreme disappointment .
the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .
not spicy enough , and far too sour .
waited a full _num_ hours for our food .
for hours - over two to be exact .
that is not true at all !
i do not recommend this place .
however , lately they have fallen out of bed .
i 'm a little confused .
our entrees were n't much better .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low .
i do n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
i literally just walked out of the establishment .
she said ummm not really !
she needs more training in customer service .
i wo n't be heading back .
beans were ok , rice , not so much .
i probably wo n't be back .
not enough servers at their new location .
if you go when it 's busy , beware .
the chips ... kinda bad .
super weird consistency and zero salt .
our second basket was better , but still lacking .
he said no problem .
bottom line , drinks : yay !
his level of customer service was appalling .
i complained but got nowhere .
you probably are n't either .
no , it 's too convenient .
the lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible .
the pizza was not bad .
which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .
this michael 's location is a disaster .
there really is no big draw .
on top of all this the location is horrible .
horrible , horrible , horrible service .
i did not leave a tip .
on of the worst chinese buffets i 've seen .
and there was no other customers but us .
what a waste of money !
even worse is the bs sign on the register .
even so the drinks took _num_ minutes .
hire another cook and install another stove .
but very slow service , and overpriced .
only takes cash or check !
i wo n't be wasting my money again .
i ordered the thai curry noodles .
almost thought i was in los angeles again .
this is not very good asian food .
i am sure there are asians in madison .
it 's nothing really special .
it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .
epic fail on this entree .
on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .
not very friendly to start .
not very consistent with service or procedures .
i will not be back .
panda is doing better then this .
no sweet , no sour .
not so freshly made !
so we left never going back first and last !
on top of that , there was no broccoli .
i wo n't return there .
the service is less than stellar .
the texture is far too gooey for my liking .
i do n't recommend going there .
my wife ended up waiting _num_ minutes for this .
it is a waste of time and money .
one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .
it looks terrible does n't it ?
sorry , boar - the truth can hurt .
so yeah , no . ''
excuse me for wanting to try your establishment .
my latest visit was not the best .
so much for being a loyal customer .
unfortunately we choose cousins .
it 's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless .
we took one sip and realized it was bad .
they have decent drink specials .
sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .
little disappointed with my beer too .
maybe they only serve locals .
wednesday night , september _num_ , _num_ .
after over _num_ minutes we left .
i could n't finish it and left hungry .
i 'm hoping it was just a mistake .
yelpers , you let me down !
boy , it was a huge disappointment .
i did n't even eat the salad .
i only ate the shrimp .
the service was soooooo slow that night .
there was no bam !
what a mess of a hotel .
the hotel was totally booked .
lesson learned for next time .
it greatly lacks attention to detail .
i was lucky my computer was not fried .
which is n't enough .
bedding was stained on pillow and comforter .
platinum member service my butt .
the food is also terrible and overpriced .
eventually one of them fell ... .
this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .
this hotel just does not feel fresh enough .
and i 've been marriott platinum for _num_ years !
worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling .
the hotel manager is a joke and very rude .
this place should be like $ _num_ a night .
first night not so great .
waited _num_ minutes , and called back .
cold showers two morning 's in a row .
they do n't give a darn .
i could n't get out fast enough .
_num_ days later they sprayed that again .
i just gave up .
the coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience .
the dispenser in the laundry room was broken .
this hotel was a mistake from beginning to end .
even complaining to management does n't do any good .
this one is a big fail .
chocolate chip , peanut butter , sugar ?
it was n't as good as i had hoped .
sadly , my croissant was none of these things .
i was n't pleased with it .
this is very misleading .
hotel was clean and service was meh .
she said she would n't know til _num_ .
their staff is dishonest and unprofessional .
do not stay here .
the staff is very rude .
you could have fooled me .
nothing to write home about .
so , better pizza ?
are you kidding me ?
the store manager 's attitude was horrible .
sandwiches come with chips , not fries .
the total was just under $ _num_ without tip .
in short , we will never return .
the scene reminds me of ... a garage .
seriously that is what we were told .
sorry to hear your mom was a lousy cook .
yes the food is pretty bad .
why people go here i ca n't understand .
i gave it three visits before passing judgement .
wo n't be going back .
but the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy .
the pancakes were pretty tasty , though .
service was super slow .
the moment i walked in i regretted it immediately .
the smell is terrible , like stale cigarette smoke .
very unhappy with my haircut .
walked in and got an app .
there was no one else in the store .
you wo n't be getting my business ever again .
very unprofessional ... just ca n't trust them .
i do n't know prices .
_num_ stars : the food is terrible .
_num_ star : the service was lacking .
overall , _num_ stars .
was fairly busy but not packed .
was told it would n't be long .
promptly left , wo n't be back .
menu was full of bland comfort food .
entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty .
average service , below average food and terrible atmosphere .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
over all , it just was n't enjoyable .
menu was extremely limited .
the desert had no prices .
trust me , this place is a bust .
i wish i could review that lady on here .
especially when the one cashier is sooooooo slow .
the selection looked appetizing , but tasted horrible .
the waitress was poor .
really tasteless and not good .
some pieces were way over cooked .
the food was awful .
too bad the food was n't .
i would be embarrassed to serve this !
ca n't justify going back ... .
kitchen does not care .
the kitchen does not know the meaning of hospitality .
tried to purchase some dj equipment from this company .
does n't make sense especially in this economy .
delicate product was not shipped with appropriate packaging .
i wo n't be ordering again .
still no confirmation yet after _num_ days .
if i could give them _num_ stars .
no honey offered with them though .
the food is n't fresh .
nobody greets you when you walk in .
( customer service _num_ ) .
you are a mess !
and you 're consistently a mess .
this place needs an iron fist .
with chicken , it cost $ _num_ .
the food is so-so at best .
this meal was a disappointment .
the waitress even apologized for her lack of attention .
gave us free drinks , and coupons .
all we ordered was hamburgers and chicken sandwiches .
cons : too pricey & ala carte .
the entrees : $ _num_ - _num_ .
the bread i wish were warm .
we were very disappointed .
the noodles were just falling apart .
so we 'll probably not ever go back .
we were not too impressed .
i wish we would n't have wasted our time .
we wo n't waste our time going back .
maybe i 'm just bitter .
the food is nothing worth writing home about .
i do n't recommend .
fried chips and onion rings were not good either .
this place is awful .
dirty greasy chicken fingers and very small portions .
stopped in for breakfast on sunday .
how hard is it to screw up breakfast ?
six of us went here for friday night fish .
it could stand a few updates .
it is a terrible place to see live music .
menu is typical bar food .
seems like our waitress had n't told her .
i wo n't be back .
shame on you jiffy lube !
did someone over rate this place ?
well they missed the boat .
it as over cooked and anything but an omelette .
not just a lot , but dripping and soggy .
c 's is just a greasy spoon .
the door locks are a joke .
it could be worse i guess .
i would n't even give this one star now .
the bruce company is very , very expensive .
yes , i was a little stressed .
she would n't give me an answer .
poor service , high prices , crappy selection .
not to my surprise , no one showed .
_num_ ) the plants this past summer were infested .
alas , customer service is poor .
after today , i will never be back .
lots of options but not that great .
many of us realized she was completely clueless .
at least _num_ in one room of the tour .
shirt sizes in the gift shop were limited .
too bad i 'm on vacation now .
maybe they deserve _num_ stars .
holy crap , it 's crap looking .
i would never rent here again .
very disappointed in this operation .
now ever time i get in i smell cigarettes .
or maybe just feel like it .
my expectations were not that high .
the wait in the drive-thru is painfully slow !
they just do n't seem to care .
avoid at all costs !
_num_ minutes to get my order .
not even worth one star !
waste of my time and money !
everything at this bk takes ten minutes .
this place is a hole .
why does the food taste weird ?
this place is slow beyond belief .
worst bk i 've ever been to !
still very slow service at drive through .
no wonder there are never cars outside !
the cheese burgers are quite gross .
the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .
same deal : lots of ringing , no answering .
for a taco bell , this one is horrible .
this is the most amazingly slow drive through ever !
never , ever go here .
their food is terrible if you ever get it .
plus , they never get it right .
worst taco bell ever !
horrible place & service .
and the service is always painfully slow .
they told me it would be $ _num_ .
you do n't even bake the pizza !
my first time at this location and was disappointing .
place was dirty and the worst pizza ever .
boy , was i disappointed !
so that was ridiculous right off the bat .
sadly , this was not the case .
extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken .
food was just low quality .
so , i stand and wait .
do yourself a favor , avoid this place .
pretty bland for chinese take out .
this place is sort of gross .
next , the shopping experience was n't much better .
the inside of the building smells really bad .
not much interest in those , huh ?
it 's just not worth it .
the building has been recently remodeled because it burned .
it was 2pm on sat and dead .
no excuse for dirty .
i 'm not joking .
it 's just a numbers thing at this point .
two of those came wrong again .
too little too late .
unbelievable and with my little girl there .
sorry , but it was .
poor quality food , very typical american fare .
this location does not have good service .
any other kfc would be better .
well , my first time was typical mediocre kfc .
the tv reception is absolutely horrible .
i 'll buy my product there from now on .
the previous review i wrote was pretty bad .
the selection was slim to non .
no big deal , right ?
this is not unusual for wally world these days .
no one said a word .
i 'm not even sure they noticed .
so probably expecting too much .
i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review .
just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .
dont hire these people .
bottom line : this pharmacy has bad customer service .
it 's completely hit or miss with customer service .
let me break it down for ya .
hide the powdered doughnuts . ''
i felt sorry for the bride and groom .
the place was not clean for starters .
the food was the worst part .
food is below average and pricey .
the maple syrup was n't up to the mark .
sausage and scrambled egg were okay .
cakes were n't good .
the staff were n't friendly enough .
they did n't even take care of us properly .
but they did n't pull off the brunch properly .
it was a waste of money .
i left the place unsatisfied and disappointed .
you will sit there for _num_ minutes .
next time we will not going back .
clean , noisy room .
your just going to waste your money !
no , it is n't .
grey is grey and pink is pink .
it is difficult to even find one .
i have really tried to avoid going again .
then i did it , i made an appointment .
evening , busy time .
ok , maybe they are a little late .
apparently another appointment was waiting .
i do not know , i do not know .
we are shopping on amazon tonight .
not going to spend money here again .
it was not appealing to me .
easily the worst chinese food that i 've eaten .
our general tso 's chicken was terrible .
very bland and overcooked .

wo n't eat here again .
the food was nasty .
the language barrier was rough as well .
to make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm .
beef curry was okay .
call them on their crap !
the staff sucks beyond rude .
should n't be in business .
do n't know how to make drinks .
tonight i ordered the chimichangas .
not sure what all the hype is about .
they never check my online order !
not worth the time !
fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only !
the chicken dishes had fat on the meat .
i ordered takeout from here tonight .
i probably wo n't be going back here .
which are really just average sized shrimp .
i suppose the worst part was delivery time .
_num_ minutes later we 're still waiting .
the driver apologized and it was still hot .
the food was so dry .
i wo n't order from here again , ever .
i will not go back to this place again .
bad business , bad service .
this place is truly awful .
the food was very meh ... _num_ people dined .
that was not the case .
biggest waste of $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
nothing more , nothing else .
no amount of ketchup could make me eat it .
this is the worst fast food franchise in town .
the drive through is slow .
the food is inconsistent .
worst bk i 've ever been to .
it does n't matter the time of day .
ordered chicken tenders they were out .
i ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go .
the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
like they have no idea what they are doing .
running out of fries ?
they should close it down at this point .
cash only and they 're out of fries .
i wait three more minutes before driving away .
i just do n't care much today . ''
no eye contact , no smile .
this is typical of the service .
i wo n't return to this location .
she was a counter waiting to get cut .
staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
sorry to say , this place is a disaster .
do n't waste you time here !
cheeseburger was not all that .
it was acceptable , but the taste was off .
the service was n't good either .
i will not be back .
i doubt it was a chef .
but i have had lame burgers there too .
if you are still reading ... .
the big problem with cheeseburger was the service .
finish eating , wait _num_ minutes for the check .
greasy food , lazy service , flat soda .
i got the guacamole bacon burger .
do n't waste your money or time .
how hard is it to wipe off the booth .
portions are weak however .
i will not be coming back .
also , why close the bar _num_ minutes early ?
i 'm just beyond put off .
nobody was cleaning up the place !
our food was barely edible .
so the food was average , not great .
the service was rushed and unfriendly .
not worth the price .
i wish i could give this place no stars .

you will find better business elsewhere .
ordering the tires was ok .
after _num_ minutes , he said he was done .
firestone called tires plus and told them what happened .
one was horrible and one provided great customer service .
my room is next to the elevator too .
i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
he then asked me what i needed .
i explained and we walked to the pump .
he just left me standing there .
he thanked me for my patience and went along .
i did n't deserve service like this .
they do n't deserve your money .
now , it 's all horrible .
you 're kind of a disaster sometimes , man .
but just ... just get it together , dude .
be greasy and awful and ridiculous , pizza hut .
julie was the consultant who helped me .
what a customer service disaster .
avoid this place like the plague .
clearly this company does n't work well with others .
dirty counters , messy machines , and dirty tables .
no card , no money left their hand .
they are like , it is just brownies .
and just walked away .
they get a negative star !
this dq does not even deserve _num_ star .
they were out of pie pieces , okay fine .
tried it , it was discussing .
waste of $ _num_ .
seriously will never go back to this place .
absolutely the slowest service ever !
however it is always a hit or miss .
today was the worst pizza i have ever had .
my husbands also was just as bad .
did n't honor online prices from their own website .
the kid at the counter was clueless .
not pink or even a smoke ring , blood .
ate here last night .
the inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky .
this is not a good thing .
not a lot of great variety .
the slaw and fries were fine .
nothing special but not bad .
one rib was fall of bone .
further down , it was closer to jerky .
all in all , not a great bbq experience .
service was flat out terrible .
not even close to the best in madison .
the ribs were very dry and tough .
will not be going back .
it used to my favorite place for barbecue .
the breast was dry .
next i tried the ribs .
the baked beans were pretty good .
the coleslaw is what hurt .
i would not recommend fat jacks .
however the the fried mushrooms were good .
i wo n't be back .
most likely between _num_ and _num_ stars .
food did n't look fresh and was pretty flavorless .
service was slow and unprofessional .
spend your money in a local hardware store .
the inside is huge , but arranged poorly .
i was probably wrong about the latter part .
he told me that 's not how it works .
again , this is apparently not how it works .
worst customer service ever !
_num_ minutes before closing .
i then waited another _num_ minutes for my drink .
poor management and training of staff is very evident .
bathrooms messy without toilet paper men 's restroom .
avoid this one at all costs .
( not cheaper ) .
it 's all garbage .
more than six dollars per container !
the bakery section is gross , too .
your bakery department sucks big time .
no worries many options to choose from near by .
i just wonder how often this happens .
oh yea they did disgusting !
the worst arby 's i have ever eaten at .
so , here is why it is bad .
this place is pretty gross .
have some standards , arby 's .
_num_ minutes we sat there and waited .
wow , what a disappointment .
steak sandwiches are supposed to be lean !
bad service and unfriendly staff .
several days passed with no response .
what a waste of time .
fake rum , maybe ?
it was totally disgusting .
so carl , just a word of advice .
it 's okay , i guess .
lousy grocery and produce , but excellent doughnuts .
i have tried a few places with no luck .
if she was busy she could have said that .
she says she does not know .
i walked out feeling completely terrible .
i will not go to your store .
however , do not get your nails done here .
its decor is horrible .
it 's pricing itself out of madison .
this is not a great first impression .
this place as reopened and should have stayed closed .
literally the worst hair experience of my entire life .
the other _num_ stations were dusty .
no one or nothing was in the manicure area .
it looked like a ghost town .
the entire experience was uncomfortable .
they gave me a discount price of $ _num_ .
i did n't realize the place shut down .
extremely disappointing first time visit .
thank you for wasting my time today .
i was very wrong !
i would never go to this place again .
they were not exciting .
when we got our drinks , they were weak !
awful service , rude bartenders .
he was not at all apologetic .
this is terrible customer service .
i am looking elsewhere .
i do n't know where their beef is from .
they really deserve a _num_ so i rounded down .
not a true butcher either .
this kfc never has the chicken you want ready .
the staff and customers are awful .
the service was slow .
even the coleslaw was very dry .
unfortunately , there was a big language barrier .
potato wedges : awful .
this particular bucks seems to be hit or miss .
the crust is incredibly thin .
their sizes are not generously portioned out .
nothing stood out to me .
unfortunately , i will not be back again .
not understanding the good reviews here .
their pizza is gross .
after that though , i was n't very impressed .
curry was bland and lacked spice and punch .
plantains were a little soggy and lacked crisp .
avoid i would give zero stars if i could .
uninspired chinese food from very nice people .
maybe that 's why i only had three bites .
quoted _num_ minutes , was here in _num_ .
the lo mien was also horrible .
there saving grace is their hot sour soup .
but in all honestly , nothing special .
this is not the place i recommend .
normally i think crappy chinese food is good .
there 's just no flavor .
the crab rangoon is terrible .
hell , asian kitchen is better than this place .
they told me that would be _num_ each .
i wo n't be ordering again .
i 'm not _num_ percent sure .
i 'm not going back .
bad service and even worse `` food . ''
however , the place is not awful .
it was a plain ham and cheese omelette .
rotten tomatoes ruin your taste for anything .
also the coffee was not good .
we were , to say the least very disappointed .
otherwise a complete waste of our money .
late night madison is tough when you are hungry .
dining room is a little dingy for a chain .
likely the hamburger gave me food poisoning friday night .
everything that is wrong with chain restaurants .
unlimited fries with every sandwich ?
the food has nothing unique about it .
quite uncomfortable , but the only seating available .
it was an experience that i will never forget .
i will be in no hurry to go back .
poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .
our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup .
the fries were cold on all our meals .
at that point i was disgusted - and done .
but my low point is for the service .
not our first visit , not our first choice .
extremely overpriced , underwhelming food .
$ _num_ for a meh burger ?
just went all ghost and ignored us .
not many customers at the time .
poor timing of food service .
bad experience , red robin !
anyway , the rating is for the food .
i was very disappointed with the entire visit .
there were no chunks of potato or clams .
the replacement was not the greatest in taste .
i 've made better wine .
horrible service , old flowers .
perhaps good product , but really poor service .
multiple people acted really rude .
she also stated everything was in stock .
i could not believe it .
he did not care .
the next day , i was sick all day .
you will be very sorry that you did !
do you like greasy overcooked american chinese ?
dragon & phoenix , eh pretty bad .
my advice , avoid this place at all costs .
bad service average chinese food .
frankly it was nowhere to be found .
order was taken right away and served promptly .
also , the prices are too high .
these guys rip you off .
i was very insulted .
i 'll keep trying , though .
the blueberries are really hard and frozen .
the effort was there but the execution was sad .
there goes $ _num_ .
shop around , they are really money hungry .
customer service was pitiful .
friday fish fry was awful .
my boyfriends fish was also disappointing .
our party was seated _num_ minutes after ordering .
the restaurant equivalent of flying coach .
it was not good .
i have too much to lose .
so i get the bartender and explain the story .
she does nothing but tell him to apologize .
so he sticks his hand out and says sorry .
1st time and as i say one and done .
this place was an ass backwards train wreck .
me no never will i stop again .
yeah , long story short ... .
the food sucked ass .
this is a harsh review but these things matter .
no accommodations were offered .
i would n't recommend this hotel to anyone !
this place is beyond terrible !
this place is awful .
no hot single chicks here .
slow service for both the drinks and our food .
it was not good .
it was not bad .
cole slaw was horrible in a little cup .
i really have no desire to return ever again .
the others are n't so great .
and it was indeed mediocre .
my chicken sandwich was pretty basic california chicken .
it came smothered in some sort of spread .
my sandwich felt apart immediately .
the worst place to watch sports in madison !
waited over _num_ 1/2 hours to receive our apps .
looked like a party on a budget .
was n't much blue cheese in it .
weak tap beer line up .
they did n't even go in and check .
but this time it created a problem .
i was not the only one standing there .
everything else started during the _num_ o'clock hour .
ca n't come in at all with it ?
expensive for food that is mediocre .
it 's just bad .
horrible , horrible service .
the food was okay , nothing special .
i went there once and had a horrible waitress .
i eventually just gave up trying to call them .
the restaurant was not busy at all .
walked in and had to wait for the hostess .
needless to say , we took our business elsewhere .
i am disappointed to say the least .
beyond the cheesy exterior , he was nice .
here 's where i 'm not happy .
lousy service once they have your money .
they do n't even deserve a _num_ star !
i was cheated around _num_ $ .
it was hit or miss and its been hot !
he was in a hurry to get out too .
not ultra modern , but contemporary design .
the fault of courtyard ?
dog rooms not so bad .
this place was a huge disappointment .
negatives : it is not cheap .
there was not very much included with our dinner .
i was really disappointed and felt a little cheated .
`` hmm ... cheap .
then she just stared at me .
the rolls left for more to be desired .
i left feeling hungry and disappointed .
i was very disappointed .
what a lazy job they were doing in there .
but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger .
want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting ?
the breakfast buffet was pretty weak .
the room was fine but nothing fancy .
i was left feeling confused .
he has never had a problem like this .
we will not be staying there again .
this easily ranks among the worst .
this not a three and a half star place .
staff are not nice .
so , we had no other place to stay .
no appt possible for detailing on weekends !
overall it was a terrible car wash .
worse place to get your car washed .
they talked more than detailing .
the bartender was nice but the place was empty .
i would recommend you look elsewhere for better service .
this place is awful .
we both received terrible service .
and its only _num_ dollars .
overpriced and poor quality .
totally disrespectful and horrible job !
they had the consistency of cardboard and no flavor .
the pizza had no feta cheese at all .
... no more domino 's for me .
i was treated horribly !
there is a discount _num_ dollar bin as well .
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this .
tonight was an epic fail on customer service .
when the food arrived it was totally wrong .
i would describe this place as mediocre at best .
only thing left was the meat .
sad , sad , sad experience .
coleslaw : shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it .
i 'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient .
mac & cheese : disgusting .
that was a huge mistake .
but was n't a big fan of the sides .
price was not counted correctly .
come to find out he was a manager .
i was not impressed at all !
not a place i will re visit .
the aisles are too small .
no help at all .
not that hard to deliver mail .
i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
courteous service can only go so far .
skip it and go to sam 's cafe .
i guess twice was enough for me .
even the apple dumplings were just okay .
i would never stay here again .
very thin walls increased the noise .
only stay here if you are _num_ .
the place is dirty dirty dirty .
the carpet in the hallway is very dirty .
but the blankets are nasty full of burn marks .
kenny the manager is very inconsiderate and not reasonable .
the coffee is bad .
also , the coffee only comes in small cups .
every other part of the meal was a disaster .
my burger was missing everything but meat and cheese .
this place is sad .
never washing his hands and never wearing gloves .
this place is a total joke !
server was good but the kitchen sucked .
the waitress was rude .
kept looking down at us and service was slow .
this is a horrible steak and shake !
i ordered the eggplant chicken special .
it was american ( globe ) eggplant .
that dish was not spicy in the least .
they were stale and not very good .
never gives total over the phone .
while others walked out with their pizzas loaded .
a poor substitute for tex-mex food .
uninspired and bland food choices .
i 'd give it a zero if i could .
this place is weak as fuck .
the location of this restaurant needs to be updated .
the beef was utterly dry and flavorless .
i did not feel welcomed here at all .
our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us .
he looked horrified but went away anyway .
my burritos were boring and tasteless .
nothing seems to stay there for long .
lately the sides have been awful .
the okra and casserole were cold .
that in my opinion is really poor customer service .
no big deal there .
my coke was empty .
i think this breaks a record for me .
the baked potato was delivered piping hot .
not really a `` farm '' person .
never heard back even though i followed up twice .
do not bring your vehicle to farm & fleet .
avoid at all cost !
supposedly they are ordered .
still nothing from the store .
not a kid friendly location .
the small salad was n't their best .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
wo n't make this mistake again .
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
the location is literally _num_ miles from the house .
should not take this long to replace an item .
avoid this place at all costs !
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
the complementary breakfast is not good .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
ownership does n't seem to care .
will go elsewhere next time .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
you wo n't be doing it this sunday .
never ever go this place again .
inches off of my hair .
i am very very very unhappy .
clearly they do n't want my business !
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
she told me no .
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .
the weather here is horrible .
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .
but some should be avoided completely .
never ordering from this place again .
but i was n't in the mood for meat .
now that 's what i call mediocre !
the biggest con , however ?
the egg roll was disappointing .
it used to be good .
but today the barista made me so mad !
the coffee here is atrocious .
cup of flavorless grey water .
third strike , you 're out !
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
i do n't know what to say .
it 's just milk , dude .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
rob you blind at every turn .
not at all from my experience .
_num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .
they refused , and charged me $ _num_ dollars !
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous !
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
this is very strange for me .
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
the place was terrible .
it 's a piece of junk .
this place is awful !
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
i have never used a business so poorly run .
or maybe they 're all this bad .
this location is weird .
their customer service is terrible .
it ends up costing me around _num_ minutes .
he made no effort to reach a resolution .
did n't even get to try it .
that 's not what i got .
my time was absolutely wasted .
i 've had bad times at brothers .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
it seems to be totally random .
never wasting my time at brother 's again .
_num_ ) never enough space .
_num_ ) hot as hell .
the fans on the ceiling are useless .
have no place to stand or sit .
also , the dj 's are inept .
i would avoid this company at all costs !
please avoid this company at all costs .
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
do not use these people , they are terrible .
it was very salty and unpleasant .
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
never again stay away from this place !
both of which were disappointing !
around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .
but now it 's barely passable .
it was a very disappointing .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
_num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
however , my last two visits were terrible .
they simply served it .
the first time i was not sure .
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
there was no soup ( wtf ) !
the food is oily and lacks flavor .
i would give zero star if i could .
this place is a total rip off .
hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .
this is a horrible place .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
they do n't know how to bill correctly !
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
avoid going here at any cost !
it deserves zero stars .
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?
this place is a nightmare .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
do n't they clean the floors ?
worst bar i 've been to , period .
regretted that in _num_ hours .
what an absolute dump .
one star is too much .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
there were flies all over the place .
the produce looked so sad and wilted .
i could barely eat it .
unfortunately this was not the case .
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
pro : none ... .
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
slowest service i 've ever had .
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .
i wasted a trip .
so maybe i am not the target audience .
soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .
the greek salad was n't anything special either .
the salad does n't have enough cheese !
this is where it falls short .
overall a little disappointing .
not a big fan .
this place is horrible .
the service is very rude .
it was a really weird experience .
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
but , ok , they were short on menus .
the menu shortage ( ?
one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
so i guess that was a bad selection .
however , the service is so-so .
way too expensive for crap like that .
there is no way these could count as tapas .
food was overpriced and low quality .
_num_ hours for lunch is too long .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
the service is soooo slow .
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
and it was still awful .
it was impossible to chew .
this was just unacceptable .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
they took down my review twice ... .
wait , no , not identical .
it was a very unwelcoming place .
; and a totally inept management of the tables .
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
the food here is generic and bland .
not worth the money .
around 9pm , i called again .
i tried calling , and no one picks up .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
will not come here ever again .
rice was stale , cold , and hard .
incredibly poor food quality .
very disappointed by this experience .
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
they were so oily and soggy .
i did n't like this place .
first , the service is slow .
so , this place is so overrated !
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
under those conditions , i say go for it .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
the dogs there are all sad .
can we say gross ?
literally , i went orange eating it .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
a total waste of money .
read the bad reviews .
knew it was not going to be that great .
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
avoid at all cost .
but why the hell would i do that ?
however , the food is practically tasteless .
avoid at all cost .
first , why do they use ground chicken ?
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
and the dish was just not good .
a curry dish with barely any veggies ?
no , potatoes do not count .
nothing but bad service here .
the car was not ready when i arrived .
i do not recommend it !
i did n't even know that was possible .
oh god , where do i start ?
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
but that 's not the worst part .
why not appeal to god directly ?
their approach to customer service is bizarre .
they stopped the upsell after that .
that explains my poor performance !
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
worse place in town !
very very rude staff !
the food however , was underwhelming .
spicy tuna was terrible .
do n't waste your time .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
the food was horrible .
worst japanese food in town !
it was strange and somewhat offensive .
the problem with this place is the service .
this place does neither .
so we walked out .
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
the service is very slow .
the ramen is so bad .
this place is a joke !
we could all smell trash while sitting there .
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
i wish i never had known about the place .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
but the fried chicken was not that good .
it was really dry .
the fish is n't anything special either .
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
however their customer service is the worst .
the food was just sitting on the counter .
so we went in and wasted _num_ min .
the wait is insane .
would not recommend this restaurant !
fridays and your applebee 's .
well , it 's not like that anymore .
but now it 's not .
but the bruschetta was just awful .
no apology , nothing .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
over _num_ hours for an average meal .
very poor quality food .
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
i could n't eat it .
the description was nothing like the actual entree .
alas not so good .
typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
we did n't have enough time for our app .
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
i did not like the sausage .
she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .
salad dressing very sour .
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
sadly no other steak cut options .
the salad bar is terrible .
unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
it just is not very good .
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ?
_num_ times worse than the steak .
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
_num_ bucks before the tip .
the ribeye said it was no problem .
the shrimp is ok , too .
i am only halfway joking .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
so ordered the _num_ oz .
steak was below average and service was lacking .
i try to avoid them as much as possible .
they could n't even offer anything else !
once again , a terrible experience .
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
i will happily spend that money elsewhere .
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
horrible apartments and management .
first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
second they do not agree that it is dirty .
never rent their apartment !
they do not care tenants at all .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
just a bad experience all around .
we tried really hard to keep it away .
so my friend parked at an empty lot .
then the car get towed .
not ok at all .
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
so that 's not why it gets _num_ stars .
maybe it was the overall lack of options .
the people were n't friendly or helpful .
but there are problems with other members there .
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
should n't be a surprise , really .
do n't go here if you can avoid it .
the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
this company is a complete fraud .
do n't give these people money .
no specific schedule for the next bus !
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
they have lost our business for good .
well , no more .
i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
the first time , i was missing some pants .
so that forced me to go there again .
do n't support this business please .
the fee for the suit was $ _num_ .
his charge should be $ _num_ , right ?
i drove down there with receipts .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
after two hours the movers never showed .
save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
the customer service was just that bad .
so disappointed in the whole experience .
they were so slow .
i think i maybe had _num_ bites of it .
however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
this is n't what bothers me .
i wo n't be back .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
in addition , it was a hot mess .
talk about bad presentation !
almost $ _num_ for _num_ mozzarella sticks ?
$ _num_ for a small steak ?
bad values all around .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
i love chain food but this place is awful .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
this place is an absolute joke .
$ _num_ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
this is not the case here .
thanks but no thanks .
i ordered a $ _num_ ham and cheese crepe .
no one even looked at us .
not worth the hassle .
it was nothing like it .
we could barely fill up _num_ minutes here .
the water interactive display had no water in it .
the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
what a sad , sad place .
to begin with , the place was dirty .
it looked like no one cared about it .
do n't be fooled .
i would n't recommend it .
dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
plus - $ _num_ to get in ?
the food though , has much to be desired .
they were that bad .
the chicken tasted like it was canned .
getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
unfortunately i should have followed the negative reviews .
the rice was drenched in grease .
omg out out a bag , just horrible .
however , our server was a really nice guy .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
much better choices for mexican food in champaign .
unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
probably less than $ _num_ .
i 'm definitely never going back .
no clue how this has _num_ stars .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
did n't like him at all .
* another problem we had here .
there seems to be only one cook .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
but that is where it begins and ends .
will not be returning .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
all in all , a terrible meal .
so , thanks , but no thanks murphy 's .
do you get the idea it was bad ?
i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
what a shit hole !
but _num_ just leaves me speechless .
my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
eh , this place was alright .
next off , i had the burger .
the fries were mediocre at best .
in a skillet that can be gross .
as i said , food was mediocre .
wo n't try it again .
slow service would n't even refill my drink .
it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty .
$ _num_ for spaghetti ?
that just is n't possible ! ''
um , why would that be , exactly ?
so then the bill comes .
then , i looked at the bill .
sadly , none of that is true now .
still no sign of my food .
by now it 's been ten minutes .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
worst customer service ever !
nope just to lazy to change it .
as well no napkins in dining room at all !
i got there late and there was no seating .
also , the massage chairs suck .
they are rude and do a horrible job .
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
if i could give this less stars i would .
this place is completely shady and horrible .
would never recommend to anyone else .
worst pedicure of my life .
somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
neither of us had eaten all day .
that 's _num_ cents an ounce .
you can tell i really hate this shit .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
the chicken taco was edible .
i was starving though .
i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
our server did n't bring us the check .
also , the service was mediocre .
yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
they were n't even worth eating .
the bar portion also pretty bad .
they also have a terrible patio in the back .
i want to punch that guy so bad .
food really , really bad .
empty tables all around .
maybe i 'll give it another try .
there was nothing in it .
the chicken did not taste like general tso .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
dry , tough , stringy , chewy .
peking garden was a weird case for me though .
i was glad i did n't though .
the service was also bad this trip .
it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
i wish i could rate _num_ stars .
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
no one should go to this restaurant .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
it was hot as well .
everything else ranges from okay to awful .
this place is the worst .
that is outrageous and appalling .
this lasted at least _num_ months .
do not go there !
worst bar i 've ever been too .
not even a hello or good morning !
it seems as though no stores can survive there .
the food court is really nothing special .
i left the place and will not recommend it .
they do n't know their head from their ass .
will never walk in store again .
i was not satisfied with my stay .
it had a cheap feel to it .
what really irritated me was the pricing .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
i did not like the pizza .
the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
slow service and bad food .
the pizza is just ok .
the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
cheap and perfectly adequate .
no , i do not need your assistance .
avoid at all costs !
also , the salon was a sauna !
overall , it was a really horrible experience .
awful , amateur job .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .

the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
drinks took literally _num_ minutes .
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
worse cleaning i have ever had .
not `` chinese food '' .
just same things fried in same sauce .

i would avoid the meat .
and i would avoid the produce .
check those expiration dates though .
can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
not a happy girl here .
would not do again .
this time i did not reschedule .
i ca n't stand this place ... .
damn you toys r us !
dude , this pizza is gross .
too bad they would n't let me though .
something 's very wrong .
why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ?
the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
i do n't get it .
it 's not worth the visit .
now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
i 'm so sorry , pops .
it was so gross !
old , smelly , & creepy .
the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
in fact , it was awful .
i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
for sure will never ever go there again .
first , it 's very pricy .
it 's not worth the price .
i would not recommend .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
not really a fan .
$ _num_ for a pint of pasta salad ?
i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
i dunno , new hire ?
avoid until they get over themselves .
man was i disappointed by my experience here .
however , it rang up as _num_ .
why should i bother shopping here ?
second problem : no leftovers .
he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
i cook thai food at home .
i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
not flavorful at all .
i will never be back .
potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
no authentic thai flavors .
but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
i wo n't be back .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
this experience was very disappointing .
warning check your credit cards and bill !
refused to refund fraud charges !
avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs !
she demanded to know what else we ate .
anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
that 's just not right .
today is april _num_ , _num_ .
the apartment is a mess .
they do n't care about their tenants .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
the apartment itself was disgusting ' !
i fell sick the first week .
ca n't wait to move out of this company .
they do not care at all about you .
this place is over rated .
to top it off , service was poor .
you have been warned .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
the service was n't good .
no pink in sight .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
and i smell like a resturant !
the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
the seating is horrible .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
never said a word never put down her phone .
the worker over there is rude !
this place has the worst service ever .
too expensive for what it is .
no bike rack , so brought bike in .
usually go in car , but no more .
unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
excessive grease is used .
also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
they have a stupid live band .
however , too little , too late .
nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
my stomach did n't thank me .
bottom line : avoid like the plague .
you could n't pay me to go back .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
needless to say we were not impressed .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
the hostess was the one who helped us .
the pasta is often over cooked .
worst service i have ever received at a subway .
this is the worst subway in champaign-urbana !

however , the place is pretty nasty .
$ _num_ for a bottle of miller lite ?
loud , but good music ?
full of disrespectful and dirty kids .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
not a fan , at all .
i effing hate this place .
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
but its too expensive .
hello , rude waitress .
what a horrible waitress .
she really should be fired .
service was horrible from the start .
only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
one of the worst bars on campus .
it can be good , it can be bad .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
there is much better sober food .
not worth the price .
never any lines to worry about here !
and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
no phone call either .
wo n't be trying this place again .
scam artists , plain and simple .
this place is just alright .
i will avoid them all as well .
do n't trust this place .

large room space just laid out terribly .
finish line , you stink .
to which ... i said , `` no .
it was like i was invisible , y'all .
worst shopping experience ever .
seems like i am not the only one .
the store just sucks .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
the greek one was a disaster .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .

she was sincere , it was just annoying .

i would n't get it again .
overall , i was disappointed having spent almost $ .

we waited another _num_ minutes for those .
not my cup of tea !
the worst was the dessert .
still the place is usually crowded .
this place does so-so to the max .
over-priced , small portions , mediocre service .
i like a lot of museums in phoenix .
the place was insanely overcrowded for the small space .
the margaritas were too strong to enjoy .
so you ate and that was it .
i was expecting more , so i was disappointed .
extremely disappointed in this museum .
let 's start with positives ...
- concessions , a dumpy little espresso kiosk ?
these seats are very uncomfortable !
however , i was terribly disappointed with the seating .
this , to me , was not necessary .
why did i try it again ?
the set up is terrible .
avoid like the plague .
- the place was total sausage fest .
like _num_ dudes to one girl .
- worst fish and chips imaginable .
- hot wings , surprisingly , we 're okay .
- philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick .
- cole slaw , more like sugar slaw .
$ _num_ just is n't worth it though .
i assumed she was going to get silverware .
there were so many things wrong at this time .
there was nothing on it .
but i would never come back again .
my meal was not put in the system .
it 's not like they were busy .
we just left and went to hard rock cafe .
ive never had even mediocre service there .
the food was gross .
here 's the downfall .
food did n't look appetizing .
would n't be surprised .
i would stay away from there drink specials .
with the shot it came out to $ _num_ .
sad to say but they returned it .
needless to say i was so disappointed .
wow , what a disappointment !
i was not impressed with this place .
that did not sit well with me .
lastly , the drinks were watered down .
my chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired .
otherwise , do n't see myself coming back .
and ... my vodka soda tasted like water .
the service was attentive , but not overbearing .
the service was terrible .
worst experience as a mom ever !
we would not go back .
overpriced tasteless food with a poor beer selection .
boy was i wrong !
i ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado .
nothing more , nothing less .
tried some chips and salsa too .
no need to return ever again .
not on my list for a quick return .
sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying .
after _num_ more minutes , we decided to leave .
ordered _num_ burgers medium .
they did n't even send a manager over .
$ _num_ for an inedible meal .
we will not be back .
it was good but overcooked by two levels .
i may not be back .
the beer selection is weak at best .
will avoid in the future .
worst service i 've ever had ( literally ) .
just an overall terrible experience .
the milk was bad !
the beef was rubbery and had an off flavor .
the au jus was flavorless .
it was good but nothing worth going crazy over .
my biggest complaint with this restaurant was the service .
it just rubbed me the wrong way .
not much flavor and a dry bun .
that is just gross .
they brought them to me very quickly .
who does n't have slaw with a reuben .
also , no kosher pickle .
in fact , no pickle .
went in on a very slow wednesday night .
the experience itself was awful !
she did n't check on refills .
the roll they use for the burgers are awful !
there was nothing going on inside .
this is why the mall gets all the business .
that the cab is still _num_ miles away !
is there a way to give zero stars ?
i live about _num_ miles from the airport .
absolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable .
never calling yellow cab again .
_num_ minutes ago was told _num_ minutes .
dispatch informed someone would arrive .
this is the worst cab service i ever experienced .
the site gave me a confirmation number .
i would not recommend this company .
the problem seems to be from the supervisor down .
you do not get to speak to a manager .
they refuse to come to the phone .
can i give these guys zero stars ?
the driver ripped me off !
it sure wo n't be yellow cab .
driver was very rude .
he was very rude .
this is the worst cab company in whole world .
way too many fucking issues .
he doesnt fucking understand i dont have time .
i would give them a negative star if possible .
yellow cab taxi is rip off !
i will never use yellow cab again .
very poor customer service .
the operator said it was _num_ mins .
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
avoid yellow cab like the plague .
you guys wonder why everyone is switching to uber ?
it was a mistake .
i was craving pizza .
i do not recommend .
it was all down hill from there though .
perhaps i just had a bad room .
but i can name a few bad ones !
rooms and bathrooms are small .
happened about once every _num_ seconds .
overall opinion : not worth the money .
the valet did n't have a name tag .
no hot water in the morning .
sorry hotel san carlos .
he was very personable and helpful .
i was not pleased to hear this .
that 's just my fault .
maybe snap your fingers too .
that 's the problem .
( yes , that is a legit excuse . )
( for me , not the hotel staff . )
the worst part is the `` manager '' .
this hotel was awful .
no hot water ( are you kidding ?
do not stay here .
no ac - this is phoenix !
she also wo n't call me back .
entire lack of professionalism and courtesy .
gross , just gross .
this hotel is horrible !
i paid _num_ for one night and regret it !
ok , now the bad part .
that 's how thin the walls are btw .
unfortunately , we were fairly disappointed .
however , we wo n't be going again .
gross old hotel - not charming in any way .
the furniture was chipped and the walls were dingy .
again , poor management and customer service .
the hotel san carlos does not do that .
we are not talking shabby chic .
there is no customer service here .
i booked it because it was cheap .
the price was not worth the product .
none in the bathroom !
no counter in the bathroom .
the valet drives up in his personal car .
the walls are thin .
there is no room service .
internet is very spotty and makes working incredibly frustrating .
the room was _num_ a night .
the pool was ice cold .
why would it even be off ?
she should only charge me like a $ _num_ .
she would not give us a discount .
she took _num_ off for valet .
do not get jessica .
but i did n't need anything else done .
what a waste of time !
horrible experience @ this ihop .
forgot order like _num_ times .
wo n't make that mistake again .
this place does not even deserve one star .
poor , slow service .
and the manager just blew off the mistakes .
i would n't bother .
that is not natural .
our group is anywhere from _num_ to _num_ .
why would soup take _num_ minutes ?
no more ihop for me .
the service here , is sooo bad !
this place was very unclean .
i wish i never came here !
but this place is horrible .
it took _num_ minutes to get our order out .
i feel the manager had no control .
i was really angry at this time .
i could wait to leave .
not the best tip either .
do n't go here , drive to another ihop .
we wait about _num_ minutes to be seated .
another 15-20 minutes goes by .
went here this morning not really craving breakfast .
he tells me they are out of ranch dressing .
my french toast was poorly made and soggy .
it did not reach my satisfaction .
the waitress said `` no '' .
she was not happy .
management and service is very poor .
literally , everybody 's order was messed up .
asked for manager and no manager ever came .
this place is ridiculous .
she did n't like her food either .
the rice and beans were nothing special .
the tacos were oily and bland .
the beans and rice were not much better .
nothing special or authentic here .
i do n't get it .
you can decide for yourself which to pick .
as for the food ... it 's horribly average .
if not , i suggest you skip it .
sadly , i was not impressed .
the beans were tasteless as well .
will not be going back .
she said there is nothing less spicy than that .
the food was n't good either .
the beans and the rice were just not good .
i am totally shocked that people like this restaurant .
the guacamole tasted watered down and tasteless .
the cafeteria type setting was also sub-par .
_num_ words ... greasy mess !
unfortunately , i do n't know his name !
it 's not free refills fyi !
they start you off with chips and salsa .
nothing worth dying for .
the chicken taco and enchilada were ok.
my tostada was soggy .
like , i might throw up everything i ate .
ok i 'm done .
are you kidding me ?
there was no soul in this food .
the chips and salsa were just okay .
the chips were a little stale and over salted .
i feel like this was just a fluke experience .
not authentic in the least .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
not to mention they offer hard tacos .
really disappointing customer service experience .
not a good answer - not great customer service .
my other co-worker did not fare nearly as well .
stopped by during a brief trip to the area .
took two bites and asked for our money back .
it was truly horrible tasting .
go taco bell its better .
the carne asada tacos were gross .
the beans were runny and tasted bad .
i will not be back here again .
their meat was overcooked and flavorless .
even their tortillas were bad !
it should be illegal to sell food this bad !
i threw it away after _num_ bites .
even the tortilla was n't cooked all the way .
i ordered _num_ chicken tacos and _num_ steak taco .
never once did i hear my number be called .
are you freaking kidding me ?
there was no apologies from anyone .
i did n't even want the food by then .
are they hard shell or soft shell ?
why did they put lettuce and cheese on them ?
the shredded beef was mushy , no flavor .
chicken texture was ok , but no flavor .
mushy as hell , no flavor at all ... .
only chicken , carne asada or fish .
the meat was just okay nothing stands out .
do n't waste your time here .
sadly , the meat was really bad .
chicken `` works '' giant burrito .
lots of beans but not enough chicken .
thus place is going down hill .
the chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore .
the chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor .
chicken tacos were not very good .
gigantic burrito was not very good .
probably wo n't be back again .
my _num_ star review is now _num_ .
they lost a long time loyal customer today .
it is dry and flavorless .
sauce is flat and lacks flavor .
much like grocery store packaged sushi .
the edamame was the worst i have ever had .
really , avoid these !
the crab puffs were nice though .
and , i also hate leaving negative reviews .
not worth your time at all !
avoid the teriyaki chicken !
it 's really , really bad .
unless all you have is a tape player .
and a crap salad . )
the service is overall bad .
my cup was empty most of the meal .
this place desperately wants to upscale .
they also do n't have facial tattoos .
but of course they were doughy and meh .
i flagged one of the bartenders down .
me : `` excuse me ? ''
yes , i am cut off .
not worth the stop .
the fish was bland .
the menu promised spicy sauce ... again bland .
it was n't worth the work and mess .
however , the italian nachos were just plain disgusting .
i really wanted to like this place .
beer was overpriced at $ _num_ for a glass .
wo n't be back .
such a terrible experience .
the most pathetic looking chicken nacho came out first .
she ate hers i sent mine back .
there was no demanding there .
pass the word do n't go to this establishment .
_num_ minutes later , i finally got served .
are you kidding me ?
cant see it staying open too long .
actually , why do i care ?
are you kidding me ?
the food ai n't that good .
i said no thanks .
i wish i could say the same about fate .
unfortunately , that was n't so .
to put it simply , he thought it sucked .
ordered a chicken thing that was marginal .
and a beef ( leather ) thing with noodles .
the service did n't suck , but close .
less flavorful and not as authentic .
holy mother of chicken , christmas and rice .
sadly , fate falls apart in its execution .
he is barely a line cook .
the food is horrible .
boo : no substitutions .
no sauce on the side .
i do not give a rat 's ass .
the same server never came by twice .
it was just awful !
not so this last time .
the food was awful .
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked ?
we walk and we walk and nothing .
the sauce was soupy .
the noodles were not pad thai noodles .
but there 's no way that 's pad thai .
i am sad to see this place die out .
i really want to like this place .
unfortunately the service is terrible .
the food so , not so great .
i am mexican ... and i know mexican food .
food here is greasy and old .
you ca n't get a bartender like her anywhere !
just wish the food was better !
can one give less that _num_ star ?
that fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust .
chose bacon & eggs for $ _num_ .
overall , just o.k .
just avoid this ... it 's not good .
i could n't blame my add on it .
there was more staff standing around than patrons .
soft and cheesy , the beans saved the day .
the bill was less than $ _num_ bucks .
seriously the food is really bad .
should my beans be orange ?
they did n't even offer sangria .
sat inside for ten minutes with no service .
moved outside and sat _num_ minutes with no service .
none of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned .
it 's really not that hard .
i 'm not sure what everybody raves about .
the giant horse scared me !
i 'm just not a fan of cold sausage .
walking in we were greeted by terrible music .
there were no descriptions of any of the food .
they did n't know what was in the items .
the food was not good .
the chicken was boiled and had no seasoning .
it was the worst shawarma i have ever had .
however , the potato salad was tasty .
sadly , it just wore us out .
too expensive for a hole in the wall .
i did n't even have a single bite .
it was $ _num_ .
that killed my appetite .
also the place looked like a dump .
the ceiling looked like it had water damage .
the whole place was trashy looking .
but her office staff gets _num_ stars .
bottom line do n't pee in the cup .
the phoenix light rail is a huge disappointment .
paradise bakery is disappointing in a few ways .
second , the caesar salad is horrible .
also the croutons are not very tasty either .
bad food , worse service .
the waitress was hot , though .
it really should be _num_ stars .
but it was like pulling teeth to get more .
the chicken was so dry and chewy .
nothing too fancy or exciting .
why did n't i check yelp first ?
almost could n't even sit down to go .
( yuck ) ok on to the rest .
it was so bland .
i was starving and could n't even finish it .
the tortilla soup was really bad .
overall , there are much better choices .
salsa , canned , fake and simply unacceptable .
the rice , meh , but edible .
the place was bad news from the very beginning .
somewhat slow service and the food was only so-so .
waitress did n't even ask how my food was .
because she knew it sucked .
nasty margarita and awful service .
not truly flavorful , nothing truly distinct .
i walked _num_ feet to this place .
these are the worst tamales that i remember eating .
and i am an awful cook !
a mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy !
rice is too bland and the beans are ok .
but it 's not there yet .
i ordered the chicken deep fried tacos .
i really was n't impressed .
the tortilla was n't crispy enough .
not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio .
the food was not good .
then we had a hard time finding our waiter .
the food was mediocre .
felt that this was very generic .
i wo n't be going back .
the chips were very watery .
as i 'm writing i 'm tasting the guacamole .
the shrimp tacos are mediocre at best .
do n't eat here when it 's busy .
today it was horrible .
this was the worst mexican restaurant i have ever .
she threw up later that night .
who can mess up a burrito .
even taco bell can do a better job .
and the worst service ever .
do n't waste your time .
will not be going again .
do not do business with this company .
i would give the cabinets _num_ stars .
cons : poor customer service .
waited another _num_ weeks without a call .
... i was pissed !
( ... i am from la ) .
avoid at all costs .
i hate chicken and i got it anyway .
anyway , it was n't even that good .
and it made me sick .
i do n't totally blame baja though .
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices .
... just go there instead .
stay away from this hooters .
bad food , bad service .
not hot at all ) .
the wings are tiny and completely overcooked .
i do not recommend these at all .
i do not recommend these at all .
friend # _num_ ordered a dozen hot wings .
i do not recommend these at all .
overpriced food with shady looking waitresses .
first parking is a nightmare .
not the best hooters but definitely not the worst .
brittany , you are a terrible waitress .
i asked for ranch and never got it .
no one asked us this .
it was actually pretty empty by then .
my wings were n't even that great .
stopped here for a late night snack .
umm ... it was clean .
wish i could select zero stars !
possibly the worse service ever .
possibly the worse service ever .
should of been a zero star rating .
never going to any hooters again .
_num_ ) flat ass everywhere .
i had it elsewhere in multiple states from hooters .
the lady stated that it was breaded and grilled .
not a service friendly place .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
i 'm seriously feeling like i 've been cheated .
this was really disappointing .
this was n't okay .
no one at front desk to sit us .
finally try to get a waitress .
they have crappy wings anyway .
we were starving and thirsty for a cold drink .
but she must have confused us for someone else .
super soggy and just absolutely terrible .
honestly , i am extremely disappointed .
the negative reviews did n't lie .
wings are super hard and have no meat .
bad service , worse food .
i would not recommend this place .
the chicken was awful on the salad .
i put my salad in the trash .
a short walk from the convention center .
food was pretty bad .
the chicken itself was mcdonald 's quality .
there are so many empty tables .
the staff is really overwhelmed for no reason .
will never go back to this hooters .
why would anyone pay money for food like this ?
overcooked pasta , check .
not my deal , though .
avoid at all costs .
the salad was mostly dismal .
surely it is not at the old spaghetti factory .
both times service has been horrible .
i really do n't like tomatoes in caesar salad .
lastly the wine selection is pathetic .
this added garlic , mushrooms and bacon .
the portions were smaller than i remembered .
rather than send it back i kept the salad .
i did n't know my spaghetti came with sausage .
probably the worst italian food i 've ever had !
how do you mess up italian food that bad ?
i 'll begin with the food .
the restaurant has lost its class .
just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals .
quality and service is terrible here .
this is a pretty lame review actually .
fine , two reasons to hate it .
a joke of a salad .
husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala .
chances of going back are slim to none .
our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly .
all in all a very disappointing meal .
my entree was really disappointing .
not as good as an olive garden .
again , horrible service !
i do not recommend .
the food was worse than fast food .
broccoli tasted old , like really old .
well it was _num_ dollar ... .
what a rip off .
flavorless and not worth the cost .
mine came back a mess .
the marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland .
either way no excuse to serve what they served .
food did not come out hot at all .
the food was also average nothing special about it .
under _num_ is the max .
the guest are broke , or old .
they 're here for a cheap feeding .
service was ok , nothing special .
crap from a can .
but not an appetizing smell .
the salad was soggy too .
he would disappear for 10-15 between each action .
_num_ minutes till drink delivery .
i got the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine alfredo .
garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good .
very hard to eat more than a couple bites .
_num_ min wait on a tuesday with empty restaurant .
`` unfortunately we 're low on servers . ''
i probably wo n't go back to find out .
our server , michael was awesome .
totally lost my appetite !
went here to meet a friend for lunch .
did not like the food at all .
flavor was very disappointing .
the food horrible i should have made my own .
food just was not that good .
our food was as miserable as the service .
i could n't even get my water refilled .
the only good thing was the decor .
the hostess was terrible at her job .
if they say a _num_ minute wait .
talked to the hostess and they do n't care .
sad and pitiful really .
do n't waste your time or money .
just left here , will not be back .
artichoke dip was all oil , no cheese .
i will not be going back .
my sandwich was n't terrible , just ok .
definately not worth $ _num_ !
stale bread , dry sandwich , no flavor .
cashier was grumpy with a bad attitude .
that screams out `` filler '' .
despite my beer being empty .
tonight was the last time .
i was also really disappointed by the menu .
however , the food and service are lacking .
i wish this place were better !
however , both were terrible .
my friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless .
quit the food , up the drinks .
the french dip was the worst of the _num_ .
the cuban pork was mediocre at best .
the blt - only okay at best .
and just a handful of stale chips .
# _num_ who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip ?
it was so gross ... we sent it back .
then the worst ... the cheeseburger .
also , it was so bland .
the service was horrible .
but the whole situation was handled poorly .
really sets a bad example for phx events .
disappointed and wo n't be back .
i was sooo excited to find your place .
wtf kind of crap is that ?
i was not impressed with my meal .
i ca n't speak of the cobbler though .
the hours of operation seem just random for one .
stupid is as stupid does i guess .
avoid at all cost !
worst car wash ever .
i get the same bs everytime i go .
not sure i 'll be going back .
this place has really gone down over the years .
first time i purchased the $ _num_ basic wash .
my jeep was beyond dirty on the outside .
i was very disappointed in the work they did .
my seats were not vacuumed .
they gave me vanilla .
i will never go to this place again .
do not go here .
what a waste of time .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
unfortunately i will not be back .
if i could do negative stars i would .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
they were also hostile and blamed me for it .
they were so rude .
my car ended up behind _num_ other cars .
no big deal i thought .
a waste of _num_ dollars .
my car sat outside and dried for _num_ minutes .
took them almost an hour to wash my car .
i was not told that .
yes , seriously - _num_ minutes !
the car wash itself is ok .
this used to be my favorite place .
the slowest , mediocre car wash in phoenix .
slowest car wash ever .
this place definitely lacks good customer service and organization .
they will never see a dime from me ever .
they better miss me with that bullshit .
plus the ticket lady was very unprofessional .
why are they such jerks ?
bread was cold and stale .
pastrami was nothing special .
quality was okay and food is kind of bland .
just finished my first trip to the downtown deli .
so , so sad !
so no comment on the structure or service .
very uninspired in all foods i have tasted .
my only down note is on the service .
this place is just ok in my book .
i went back and tried it again .
we stopped in for lunch last week .
and my husband selected the greek chicken marinara .
thanks , but no thanks .
it is a void .
the sandwiches were dry and not very good .
the food is just bad .
my chicken sandwich was dry .
the menu is so limited .
would you like chicken or chicken ?
chicken in a pita ?
chicken on some lettuce ?
chicken rolled in a tortilla ?
and the pita chips are bland !
instead , their food is bland .
it looked like it would be great !
flavors were good , nothing special .
( still i 'm strangely addicted to it ) .
also , the restaurant is just dirty .
my intention is not to get free stuff .
that being said , here is my update .
unnecessary , i tell him , but nice touch .
now , _num_ weeks later , nothing .
i was pretty excited to try this place .
the pita was hard around the edges .
it could have been just a rare bad day .
not bad , but not the best .
i am being kind with the _num_ star rating .
floor was a mess as were tables .
i got _num_ cups of ice cream .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
i would n't recommend this place .
the met apartments are not energy efficient !
this is the most understaffed subway in phx .
it was not very busy .
worst subway in the history of the world .
their sandwiches really are n't all that healthy .
i wouldnt call this a salsa club .
it looked ok , i liked the outside patio ?
i more than likely will not go back .
now i can not stand to listen to it .
it 's sad how few options actually presented themselves .
we did n't feel like parking again .
but service unfortunately has been a regular issue .
but unfortunately - i ca n't .
a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler .
today was the worst , though .
i did n't mind my overpriced drink that visit .
i do n't really know why .
never great , never bad .
in fact , we should already be closed . ''
last night 's dinner was no different .
meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table .
the fries were bland .
and nothing i had was good .
did not come completely mixed and barely pink .
it is small and boring inside .
save your money and find somewhere else to dine .
_num_ people walk in on a friday night .
this hard rock is really nothing special .
overpriced and mediocre food at best .
not worth the wait .
it just felt kind of depressing .
he clearly could n't care less .
- the music videos they play are awful .
the mac n ' cheese was nothing special .
the service was beyond poor .
$ _num_ burgers that do n't look interesting ?

i have family visiting from out of town .
she was rude , curt and generally unfriendly .
will not be returning .
and the manager was so rude to everyone .
the staff is rude and all standing around talking .
this is the short bus of all mcdonald 's .

are you freaking kidding me ?
this is fast food not your local coffee shop .
the hash browns are gross .
it was a terrible experience in every possible way .
got ta remember not to return here ever !
do n't even bother coming here .
but unfortunately that did not happen .
total waste of time .
worst mcdonald 's i 've ever been to .
they also quite frequently mess up our orders .
staff does n't seem to care .
sonic down the street from now on .
just does n't scream exciting to me .
phoenix downtown is boring overall .
very nice facility , easy to get around .
( do n't eat at tortillas . )
the atmosphere is stale and the service adequate .
i will not visit jordan 's again .
so i said i need another doctor then .

friendly service and clean but boring , bland ambiance .
nothing like the location at town and country .

this is just sad .
i blame the ridiculous payment required parking structure .
that 's a shame .
terrible , terrible service .
sloppy work - uneven filing , polish uneven .
impersonal and rude service .
will not go back .
i was so disappointed in this nail salon .
but it was not .
do n't talk to me like i 'm twelve .
i am not one to write bad reviews .
then the finished product was crappy .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
this was a waste of money and especially time !

both visits were n't good .
i 'm just not a fan period .
sushi rolls were terrible !
oh my lord , it was a disaster .
_num_ star for saying `` thank you .
i ordered the tempura dinner and was very disappointed .
the customer service is awful just to start .
i order sushi and the taste was n't fresh .
poor choices of sides ( e.g .
i will never go in this restaurant again .
sorry , honey bears .
sides are completely forgettable .
i ca n't give the sandwich a passing grade .
and for _num_ bucks , i want better .
people who enjoy good bbq should avoid this place .
but even that can not be true .
just not impressed at all .
the pork was dry with no smokey flavor .
the chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor .
( _num_ stars ) .
overpriced and nothing special of this bbq chicken sandwich .
the one central is not good .

about _num_ minutes went by and no food .
now , this was n't some big styrofoam container .
but the big problem were the ribs .

i never like to see a business fail .
dam i am mad .

my wife may go back but i never will !
noticed most other customers were waiting too .
another _num_ minutes before # _num_ came out .

i 've tried their other food and its terrible .
the fried chicken and catfish had absolutely no flavor .
the bread is cold and soggy .
anything else and you 'll be really disappointed .
the sandwich was awful .
i ate the sandwich with a fork instead .
the fries were ok so thats all he ate .
the counter help was extremely rude .
this place has really lost it 's touch .
other than that i wo n't be back .
so it 's okay to serve bad food too ?
all he said was oh okay and walked away .
remember i did not place the order .
the worker was not rude but he was indifferent .
i just ca n't deal with bad service .
the drinks are watered down .
they also ran out of plates .
boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq .
i 'm really torn between _num_ and _num_ stars .
overall , the food was not so good .
tolerable but not satisfying at all .
do n't get me wrong .
unfortunately , we wo n't be back .
maybe built in _num_ and never remodeled .
_num_ star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich .
i just was n't impressed .
it is n't so expensive that i would mind .
horrible customer service at this location .
it 's like they hate other black people .
customer service is always creepy .
they do not cater to their own folks .
the cheap bun does n't support the sauce .
i guess i should 've read the reviews first .
i threw half of it away .
the meat itself smelled horrible .
literally a faint odor of dog food .
the service was , umm , strange .
not friendly or unfriendly .
had n't been in such a long time .
the meat was flavorless .
the bottom bun was practically liquid .
my husband did n't want to eat his pork .
so disappointing ( and expensive ) .
worst bbq i every experience .
this place is garbage .
the meat was bland , tasteless .
not filling at all .
tacky tables with bus stop ads in them .
bbq sauce is nothing to write home about .
i think the meats are boiled and not smoked .
do n't eat here .
the meat had no flavor whatsoever not even salt .
i gave it one star because of the fries .
sub-par pulled pork sandwich .
no real bbq ( smokey ) taste .
bbq sauce was nothing special .
i wo n't be back .
prices are too high for standard fare .
speaking of service , let 's not .
you lost a long time customer and fan .
strangely rude and condescending .
it ruined our experience and vibe of the place .
poor service , poor choices .
disappointing to say the least .
we left confused by the entire experience .
when the plate came they were not on it .
this time a waste of time and money .
just not worth the money .
the risotto it was served with was terrible .
it was hard and just not appealing .
i wo n't be back .
was not impressed at all .
the polenta was too thick and a bit cold .
will not be back .
and then never returned to take my order .
i was just at a wine dinner tonight .
$ _num_ for four courses and four wines .
went here for easter brunch .
it is _num_ star food with _num_ star prices .
that is not a caesar salad .
that is not bruschetta .
the prickly pear margarita was very small .
but our guy , uh ... not so much .
i was disappointed in all our selections .
neither dish had much flavor .
overall , i was disappointed .
it was not cool to even be in there .
go not go there for tastings !
obviously these people know nothing about wine pairings .
do not go to this restaurant !
unfortunately , they are out of business .
in fact , its just pretty generic .
i find nothing appealing about this place .
but nothing to get myself worked up about .
the bread and bacon were practically dripping in grease .
the food is bland .
the big unit -- bland .
that 's one disappointing appetizer .
the corn beef on my sandwich was tough .
it was dead inside .
it was the worst margarita i 've ever had .
surprisingly small size portion cut very thin .
the service was suck though .
not worth the drive from nor phx .
good food - but horrible service .
when we were , we ordered beer and wine .
our waiter dropped off my boyfriend 's beer .
it was not the one he ordered .
so , he ordered another beer .
the only good thing about our experience .
we were very very very unhappy with our visit .
dry fish , cheddar cheese and lemon ?
this place i had mixed feeling about .
i went here with my friend for lunch .
it was n't organized at all .
i was very disappointed and will not return here .
first thing the hours and parking situation are terrible .
finally had our chance and we were disappointed .
it was bad , i was expecting nathan 's !
our service was not any better .
a little too late .
but , the food , that is another story .
_num_ words describes this place : tourist trap .
hot dog was flavorless and chilli was bland .
anyway , along comes the food .
ah well , _num_ dollar sandwich down the drain .
we could n't even hear each other talking .
the restrooms are not clean .
after a while it gets annoying .
i was really disappointed at my experience here .
the big disappointment , though , was the food .
now the not do good ... .
welcome to alice 's overpriced tourist trap nightmare !
food is expensive and totally tasteless .
the fish fry and fish tacos were the worst .
dont fall for the trap like me !
do n't go there unless you are very patient .
wednesday was _num_ % off their salads and meatloaf .
my salad was disgusting , to be frank .
go for a beer but not a meal .
firstly the food was horrible .
are you freaking kidding me.
what the hell kind of response is that ?
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
do n't waste your time or money !
non attentive staff , very rude bartender .
left before getting waited on !
the place was packed too .
you do n't have any bottles back there ?
- the restrooms are like gas station restrooms .
- service is slow .
overall , not a good experience .
service is slow & totally apathetic .
unfortunately there were no grilled veggies in it !
that makes it really simple for everyone .
as for drinks , they really are just overpriced .
i know they have rent , i get it .
so , service was bad .
complete and total let down .
alice cooper , you should be ashamed .
there was basically zero wait staff .
there was no wait service - at all .
the kids deserve so much better .
the food was dry and the employees horrible !
the club sandwich was dry and lacked flavor .
my buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo !
my wrap was n't even hot .
way too much batter on the wings .
typical selection of beers and drinks .
i choose the fries and the nightmare chili .
it was an extremely disappointing dining experience .
i ate them and it filled my stomach .
first time i actually checked in on yelp .
this is just a noisy sports bar .
but otherwise , meh , i 've experienced better .
what a waste of money !
needless to say , we will never return !
bbq meat tasted old .
been there plenty of times before .
all visits alright , not exceptional though .
obviously , i had lost my appetite .
this time was worse then before .
but he did n't do anything until we complained .
mike , the bartender , waited on me .
nothing really stood out with my meal .
everything was pretty mediocre .
wo n't be back when visiting again .
rude , slow and unorganized hostess staff .
waited _num_ hrs and never served .
what a complete waste of time .
no wait time , seated us fast .
what did i miss to receive the crap service .
will i be back ... no !
i ordered a salad with grilled chicken .
half the chicken was cold and half was warm .
i did n't even get my food order !
so i had to wait another _num_ min !
in alice cooper i do not trust .
the waitress and/or kitchen got our order wrong .
really not anything special .
not much else to say about this place .
finally got a table and the waitress was awful .
wo n't be back .
the food was not good .
i really would n't recommend this place .
maybe get a beer but not the food .
the rest of the meats were serve cold .
only to be completely let down .
it was burnt and embarrassing to receive .
a little ghetto in areas .
the waitress was not attentive to our drinks .
unfortunately my experience was less than par .
beer was n't cold .
looks like i went to the wrong place .
it was edible , but not enjoyable .
this place is not even mediocre .
this one little thing would improve this place immensely .
quick and easy , not good and cheap .
talk about bad mexican food .
wo n't be going back .
after the game we stopped again , same thing .
pretty terrible all around .
only redeeming quality was patron shots .
would n't go back .
but tonight two really disappointing things happened .
very sad to think it was taken .
i would not order the two taco lunch again .
sorry phoenix this `` ai n't '' it .
ok i am biased .
had a terrible time .
the lines were incredibly long .
it could have been a very ugly scene outside .
are you kidding me ?
a _num_ ounce water bottle .
i would make a fortune , i 'm sure .
for $ _num_ i could n't believe it .
and it was $ _num_ for a soda .
do not stay here .
the hostess was equally clueless .
the place was only a third full at most .
no reason for the extremely poor service .
ca n't wait until sliders opens for the season !
this tgi fridays is an epic failure !
worst customer service ever !
no reason the place is empty !
the place was not busy at all .
the restaurant had no more than _num_ tables sat .
not real busy inside .
his attitude was fairly arrogant .
the food was horrible .
do n't go here on a game day .
left paying over _num_ for sodas and _num_ meals .
do n't waste your money with this place .
no big deal we did n't ask for it .
the chicken appetizer my wife ordered was barely warm .
needless to say - i was not happy !
the food was disappointing and the service was horrible .
saturday night game , no reservation .
first off , there is n't anywhere to wait .
there are no benches or chairs .
the hostesses and waiters were all under _num_ .
it was a mess , with zero organization .
hopefully we have better luck next time .
from the bad service to the bad manners .
absolutely horrible service today .
i was left speechless .
pay attention people or get off yelp .
a lot left to be desired .
i had the bourbon chicken , meh !
the sweet potato fries ... limp and not crispy .
their are other options , like hard rock cafe .
she comes off rude and she is a bitch !
worst customer service ever !
welcome to impersonal banking at its lowest .
very unprofessional and rude employees .
this is not sour grapes because of that .
they did n't have one of those bartenders .
overall , we do not recommend this establishment .
i would n't stay here again .
my room was dirty .
flat screen tv with standard cable channels .
no fan in the bathroom .
toilet leaked water onto floor .
very loud air conditioning unit .
hallway noise could be heard in the room .
curtains did not fully block out street light .
breakfast selection limited compared to most hotels .
feta or no feta ?
it has little cheese and is not flaky .
the gyro meat tastes like ... nothing .
anyway , the restaurant pretty much blew .
is he gon na hate it ?
your last name is greek .
well , that was stupid .
not because of the taste .
`` it 's not offensive . ''
_num_ % completely underwhelming .
the quality was crap and it was $ _num_ .
- awful gyro meat .
- the sauce was mediocre .
- fries are n't anything special .
save your time & money and go elsewhere .
`` this is how a house is built .
the few unique exhibits were very underwhelming .
the digital world might have been interesting in _num_ .
man , the science center has gone downhill !
first of all , this place is expensive !
how much more boring can an exhibit be ?
i thought that was lame .
it was interesting but i was a little disappointed .
this was god awful .
this was totally lost .
warning -- - do n't do it .
there is absolutely no excuse for this .
most disappoint museum experience ever .
in short i would n't waste my money here .
so they did n't fail completely .
so why only two stars ?
the employees were n't very friendly .
the layout of the place is confusing .
nothing really makes sense in the layout .
some did n't work at all .
the heartbeat drum was cute , i guess .
this place has gone down hill .
after two hours , we were done .
could n't get near the exhibits .
really poor sound control .
so glad i wasted $ _num_ on the groupon .
( what finish would you chose for your bathroom ?
why does any child care about that ? )
and any additional attractions are more money .
went early and could not see the displays .
did n't like it .
it 's a shame it only caters to children .
past that age , and they would be bored .
if i could give _num_ stars , i would .
turns out the feature was n't playing .
ppl like michelle work at the az science center .
i 'm assuming michelle just does n't like kids .
i would not recommend this company .
my car became disabled in my garage .
does n't anybody give good customer service anymore ?
shady business practices all around .
my dr 's ma , was loud and obnoxious !
we ordered online + _num_ star .
they have blue cheese + _num_ star .
_num_ out of _num_ times it 's anything but !
i do n't recommend going to this pizza hut .
this was such a rip off .
i ordered two medium sized pizza with thin crust .
and get your teeth cleaned !
is your stomach hurting ?
the care we received was substandard .
we did n't feel comfortable in their care .
would have preferred not to have dealt with residents .
( _num_ ) billing office was difficult .
no `` excuse me '' or anything !
i 'm not kidding .
i would never get care here .
the quality of care is very poor .
avoid this hospital at all costs !
rooms were small , uncomfortable and unbelievably dirty .
i was given a blanket that smell very badly .
again poor communication and rude staff were present there .
actually i would not encourage anyone to go here .
that seems so biased and very misleading !
i 'm sure you will leave disappointed .
two thumbs down to this lemon !
boy , was i sorry .
no greeting , no smile , no eye contact .
they just do n't give a damn .
very odd and not really nice at all .
no complaints at all .
i 'm not difficult to please .
i was surprised how mediocre it was .
even the margarita just was n't that flavorful .
the food was oily and the service sucked .
food is still great but the service was terrible !
we were very disappointed .
that and the service was not good .
have had better and also worse .
but check your bill before paying .
that does n't sit well in my book .
the experience started out lousy .
the food is horrible !
no sizzling hot skillet here !
the rice was super bland and had no flavor .
the salsa was weird .
even the chips was bland !
once seated , it took forever to get service .
after this , i was never going back !
again , hard to get service .
there are about _num_ tables and _num_ waitresses !
food was very mediocre .
hashbrowns came out with no color and soggy .
tamales were old and tough as leather .
the service was bad .
the waitress had a bad attitude .
the waitress was also difficult to find .
i wo n't be going back .
the reason why is because their service is terrible .
i just hate getting ripped off .
how hard is it to screw up a taco ?
they are all rude !
this guy is awful .
i went to him for _num_ visits over months .
he told me nothing was wrong with me .
this man cares nothing about your pain .
the showers and bathrooms are completely disgusting .
i would have rather relieved myself outdoors .
it was painful to see .
the food is also disgusting .
even the oatmeal is gross .
do n't even say that in-n-out is better .
the meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour .
i tired it and that is enough .
amongst the worst fast food burgers .
easily the worst bun on earth .
how the heck could anybody like this place ?
i 'd rather give my money to another business .
wondering if it was made last dinner rush .
i was really excited to finally try whataburger .
more like what a disappointment .
maybe it was just too hyped .
_num_ minutes later she is back to my friend .
actually , there would have been no _num_ minutes !
we left _num_ hours later .
take the good with the bad .
the chips were stale .
so why only two star ?
parking was very limited due to the construction .
one star is far more than they deserve .
the owner ruined the entire experience .
the part where this goes bad is the management .
this time it was not .
my advice to phoenix visitors , avoid this place .
a co-worker was very disappointed also .
it 's too bad .
it 's not that great .
it was dry and it tasted like paper .
i knew immediately that something was wrong .
i really do n't think i 'll be back .
but our burritos were not great .
i do n't understand why people eat here .
i got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos .
soft corn tortillas , of course .
i was never called back , emailed , nothing .
i had a few bites and lost my appetite .
i wo n't be going back .
but whatever i order seems boring and uninspired .
and the rice still tasted more steamed than fried .
i have not been back since .
as for the main dishes , they lack taste .
nothing was good , i 'm sad to report .
it was just not a good experience .
the chicken egg roll was very greasy .
my main dish was the cashew chicken .
it was hot , but tasteless .
gross , gross , gross .
with several pathetic pieces of onions .
this is not chinese food .
my third timing coming .
i will not be back .
food is unfortunately mediocre not what we thought .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein with lobster sauce .
for crying out loud , ramen ?
the restaurant was set up kinda weird .
the place could use a little updating and tlc .
well , this hot and sour soup was disgusting .
worst customer service ever .
do n't bother with this place .
people die in surgery centers .
no problem , just schedule me for another appointment .
it 's $ _num_ people .
they do not return phone calls or emails .
this is a disgrace .
cook sitting on the counter dirty .
flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty .
why let that ruin my lunch ?
the burger was dry and not tasty .
do n't waste your time .
not my favorite , but fries are fries .
it was dropping and the bun got instantly soggy .
we will not be back .
this place is a hell hole .
would i be back ?
really good looking menu but the execution really failed .
our food did n't arrive for another _num_ minutes .
yes , an hour and forty total .
my burger was good but the fries were awful .
service was non-existent so we were ignored .
total should have been _num_ bucks .
will not frequent this location again .
you ca n't pay me to come back there .
drinking , drinking , drinking .
there is zero energy .
was i expecting too much ?
it was the most depressing experience .
this is clearly where strippers go to die .
the place was surprisingly active for a wednesday afternoon .
like , where the hell did they come from ?
the girls here are downright disgusting .
it was time to leave ... quickly .
save the time and trouble and go elsewhere .
yes , this place is hood .
total and epic fail .
shame on me i guess .
i was informed a doctor would call me back.
i wouldnt consider this a horrible place .
four hours pass and no call .
nine days pass and no call .
she is certainly not in the correct profession .
they saw me april _num_ , _num_ .
this visit was nothing more than q & a .
tears would not stop .
it was pretty gross .
what a horrible horrible place .
i had _num_ of weed in my car .
the general staff are completely incompetent and unhelpful .
it is not a dentist office !
are you kidding me ?
do not get your car fixed here !
used this company through my appliance warranty .
not at all true .
bad reviews here and other sites are well earned .
all of their service contacts are horrible .
tech was not interested at all about the install .
hearing this i left my uniform there .
there was no help for them in any way .
i am not comfortable doing that anywhere .
so i am lost of what to say .
did not live up to the hype .
if you live _num_ minutes away , sure .
this place did n't want our business .
i wo n't go back .
this time _num_ cans were defective .
cons : abysmal customer service .
inventory control needs some help .
then you might be screwed .
it 's been _num_ days !
the repair service is terrible .
by taking too much of the outside covering off .
first my shipping error , now this .
cost was too expensive .
the salsa was just ok .
not much flavor in the shrimp or fish .
i 'd rather stick to rubio 's for tacos .
nothing to make me want to return .
two stars for poor customer service .
it 's none of your business and quite rude .
this rainbow led to disappointment .
sorry to tell ya my fellow yelpers !
unfortunately , the owner was rude and indifferent .
i just had the worst experience at red .
it felt more like an overpriced museum .
i 'll never waste my time there again .
i was so excited to check out this store .
worst clinic i have every experienced .
they are too big and give patients false hope .
do n't rely on them scheduling you correctly .
everytime i would go they had someone new .
the chips and salsa were decent but nothing special .
overall a very disappointing experience .
we complained to the waitress but nothing was done .
the service was not the best either .
my taco and tostada were just alright .
gut bomb was more like it .
i wo n't be back .
the meal was n't terrible , but easily forgettable .
all in all , a disappointing lunch .
the breakfast burrito was particularly boring .
ice cold corona 's at $ _num_ a pop .
wo n't be coming here again .
but this one is always short staffed .
she was not providing service to other customers .
there was literally trash and food all over .
we just walked out .
however , our biggest problem was the service .
she cleaned off a table and sat us .
this is a _num_ star at best .
the prices is not $ should be $ $ .
horrible horrible horrible service !
was n't even busy today !
the prescriptions are not filled when promised .
they lost one that took me forever to get .
much too sugary with no other flavour .
burger was good , sandwich was very mediocre .
overall , a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience .
something is wrong here .
unfortunately , the food does n't make its marks .
the building itself is adorable .
maybe used to be an old house ?
very quiet , like empty quiet .
but we wo n't be back for dinner .
two thumbs down ; two thumbs way down .
food is where it goes downhill .
we got the crab cakes which were only mediocre .
my excitement did not last long .
this place is all hype and nothing memorable .
hot dogs = terrible .
too thin and no flavor .
two attempts to get the food we ordered .
not a smooth running process .
but they keep getting the orders wrong !
carrot and raisin salad on the menu ?
really this place was gross .
they need to just scrub the place down .
how can you make a gross blt !
dry , flavorless , terrible .
problem _num_ : very dry chicken .
musty is chic now ? )
_num_ in phoenix is like _num_ in boston .
the food on the other hand is horrible !
burgers , hot dogs and cold sandwiches .
wrong ice cream , wrong topping .
it looked equally disgusting .
this was my third time and probably last .
the service was terrible .
i wo n't be back again .
the food is absolutely dreadful .
they are not even trying to make it good .
meaning the shake had no flavor .
but wo n't return for the food or shakes .
first impression : bad .
dude , just write it down !
we just shrugged it off & ordered .
i was so embarrassed that i picked this place !
i was severely disappointed .
the food was terrible and completely overpriced .
the service was not good .
do not waste your time here .
bought a groupon and used # _num_ of _num_ .
the food was not good at all .
waitress was not friendly either .
the potato salad hardly had any flavor .
food was mediocre at best .
however , the hard boiled egg was food service .
meats were the cheapest of the cheap .
this is a very short window .
no french fries , just bags of chips .
i had a great visit here .
and the menu is n't online .
a little too dusty for my liking .
first off it is a frozen tasteless pre-made patty .
i hate that taste .
nothing worse than freezer burnt meat .
we wo n't be going back .
ok , i 'm all for dive bars .
the pee smell was just too much .
i have to say i was a bit disappointed .
shame on them for no chips and salsa !
worst mexican disaster to hit planet mid town .
sloppy burrito fold gooey cheese processed beans .
the restaurant has no place to sit indoors .
they have limited hours .
i gave it _num_ stars for lack of process .
chicken was dried out , and hard .
i went to ranch market !
but there are several checkout lanes .
they sure do n't know how to do business .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
no recognition from staff that this is an issue .
this is a _num_ minute job to do !
do n't use this location .
`` oh , no problem .
do n't do business with this place !
no wonder the warranty was only for a year .
worst hotel ever for this `` level . ''
the front desk gave us the wrong room key .
it actually opened another room .
underwhelming - attention to detail is lacking .
i did not have a good experience here .
worst front desk staff ever .
the room was barely sufficient .
that 's not an attempt at humor .
the sea bass was gross .
unfortunately , the food was only okay .
way overpriced for the amount of seafood you get .
they did n't taste fresh either .
i do n't get all these 4-5 star reviews .
good food but terrible waitresses .
it ruined my entire meal with the family .
the wait for the food was long as well .
there are no baby changing stations in the restroom .
food very mediocre and service was very slow .
but the beans and rice were terrible .
do not buy a vehicle from these people .
horrible place to do business !
`` if it is broke , just ignore it .
over $ _num_ to get it fixed .
total rip off kind of people !
ate two bites and moved on .
overall not a good experience .
do not get a car loan from this company .
worst customer service ever !
i agree with ian below as well .
it 's too bad .
but for me it was too much so .
garden scheduled to work until _num_ pm .
i just do n't get it .
the hype around this place is ridiculous .
what the desert botanical garden has is desert .
the desert botanical garden is just desert .
and i 'll go for a hike .
nope , i have n't missed anything .
second visit was as underwhelming .
what a complete waste of money .
sooo not worth it !
service is slow , and not always friendly .
seems the non jeweler has the place figured out .
unfortunately , i had my two kids with me .
i am not that kind of parent .
she was just rude .
because of their bad attitude and rudeness .
i quickly paid and left .
the store itself is filthy .
this is completely unacceptable .
i likely wo n't be back .
i had the tuna today and it was gross .
they leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke .
the in room dining is mediocre at best .
i 'm glad i 'm only here two nights .
it was all downhill from there .
i can not recommend this hotel .
the hotel and warn and very out dated .
the carpet in the guest rooms is disgusting .
it 's just too much trouble i guess ?
there are two positives .
a little disappointed in this hilton property .
not the best hilton property i stayed at .
find another hilton in phoenix if you can .
needs a major remodel and cleaning job !
come on , hilton , get your act together !
i will not be staying with the hilton again .
unfortunately this room was dated , dirty and noisy !
there 's no standards and no new construction .
it 's a crap shoot .
i would have much higher expectations for $ _num_ .
no a/c that works .
glad we left , never again !
it was too sour for my taste buds .
after _num_ or _num_ minutes , our appetizers came .
this should n't have been their best dish .
i could have cooked better fish .
we were disappointed with the food .
there was n't much flavor to the food .
that was some seriously dry , bland food .
the pupusas were crazy delicious though .
i would totally return for these .
one of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas .
they ordered after me about _num_ min .
why would u do that to your own business ?
nothing to brag about .
wo n't recommend this place to anyone .
why is everyone standing around ?
she 's the most dishonest employee ever .
too bad it ended there .
do n't waste your hard earned money , too .
i had my car serviced here .
a trusted , hard working , friendly auto business .
no problem , i tell them .
would you guess i received no response ?
so i believe him and they fix it too .
i was unsure if i could leave or not .
i paid $ _num_ for all of this .
just terrible , trying to take advantage of people .
goodbye forever , sonic .
the customer service at this sonic is horrible !
i know it 's sonic , but c'mon .
it 's called low lights people .
guess i 'll watch fox from now on .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .

i ca n't believe these people .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
worst customer service ever .
the main problem is the walls are very thin .
this place is an absolute nightmare .
they , however promised to find me another location .
this property has become and absolute disaster .
if i could give negative stars i would .
the laundry room is always in deplorable conditions .
they are not helpful at all .
i wo n't be back .
but i wish i stayed at the double tree .
however the service was lacking quite a bit .
they did n't seem very friendly .
very bad food and very bad service .
all in all very bad food .
`` should i finish this or no ?
a complete waste of money and ruined my day .
for the price , i would expect better service .
the service was not good at all .
you 've been warned .
they do n't care about their customers .
went in at _num_ pm on a sunday .
restaurant had perhaps _num_ tables sat .
waited another _num_ minutes and left .
everything else just looked unappetizing due to the presentation .
i could n't believe it .
it 's not worth the $ _num_ bill .
they served beer that was expired by _num_ months .
they seem to stock old beer .
i guess you dont need my business .
if you are indian you will regret it .
unfortunately , we were let down .
yes , tough chicken .
cold , stale food .
never ever going back .
i had a bad day - do n't judge !
this place is a homeless shelter .
it 's nasty in there .
sorry for my long review .
if i could give this zero stars i would .
not a huge selection of books .
do n't park your car here while traveling .
$ _num_ later , car is fixed .
situation was handled very poorly by hampton inn management .
maybe i stayed here at a bad time .
dingy , dirty , depressing .
holes in wallpaper , stains on carpet and furniture .
not sure if i can even sleep here .
thankfully , none of my stuff was missing .
what a terrible visit !
then i walked into the bathroom .
that is why i 'm writing this review .
but , c'mon , it 's not that scary .
granted , i ai n't going by myself .
they serve drinks just like anywhere else .
the drinks were cheap , darts were fun .
the guys shooting pool were no joke either !
pool and darts and beer no extras .
not much has changed .
but the crust was like shoe leather .
overall probably would n't come back .
the food was awful .
who serves potato skins without sour cream ) .
the food ... is uninspired and bland .
the red sauce is ... pretty bad .
the veal parmigiana was horrid .
the spaghetti side was forgettable .
i was not impress with the food at all .
we had a half pepperoni , half veggie .
i 'm not going back .
anyway , they bring out our desserts first !
our server however was very poor .
food was mediocre at best .
just really not what i have come to expect .
nothing bad per se , but nothing good either .
it 's too bad .
it was _num_ minutes .
we put in orders for waters and _num_ beers .
my wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini .
below average to pretty bad .
it was just a bad overall experience .
it was busy n we waited _num_ minutes roughly .
nothing special ... i would skip it .
new management is clueless !
if anyone told you otherwise , they were lying .
_num_ the bathroom situation is chaos .
none of which sadly , would ever come true .
i will not be back !
not to mention it 's clearly marked no cameras .
this venue is awful .
third row is not so bad .
it 's a little inconvenient .
i sadly do have complaints about it though .
place was filled with smoke .
overall , i 'd avoid this place .
not good customer service !
more women then restrooms and dirty .
reason for _num_ stars ?
my back was sore after _num_ minutes .
... not a good first impression .
the entire two hours was miserable .
however , it needs some serious attention .
the bathrooms and concession stands are thoroughly outdated .
my seat was very lumpy .
the place was very dirty .
hot as hell too .
too small and hot .
the venue was a disappointment .
so no beer or drinks for me .
disappointed but i knew that could happen .
over all glad i went because it was heart .
the seating rows were not marked at all .
parking was $ _num_ coming in .
people were taking up _num_ parking spaces .
we could n't really stand to dance .
that bathroom is small , old and ridiculous .
no water fountains inside .
i would n't go there again .
absolute worst customer service ever .
i 'm not sure where i should start .
lesson learned , just awful .
you 've been warned .
really did not like it here at all .
food was not particularly great either .
i will not visit this place again .
wo n't be running back any time soon .
i would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone .
sorry , no dice .
sadly all these things have gone .
it ca n't come fast enough .
not to mention they 're overpriced .
the staff is very rude .
i ca n't wait until this lease is up .
parking , is a nightmare .
unfortunately , my good luck has worn off .
the new residents do not care about their surroundings .
also they started a trash service and they suck !
there 's constantly trash left behind everywhere .
bad really bad start .
slept ok , the bed was fine .
this motel is terrible .
i wo n't be back .
the meat tastes alright , but nothing special .
unfortunately , it 's not just $ _num_ .
more than that , it was simply not good .
ten years ago this was the bomb !
if you try , it is just a mess .
out of forks , out of salad ?
waited _num_ min for cold food ?
the chicken meat lacked any flavor .
and the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy .
plus , no sides and no kid options !
i 'm never eating there again .
but honey bears has a _num_ star rating .
that 's why i 'm confused .
my family was not to impressed either .
hot links were very average .
honestly , i 've made better bbq at home .
horrible horrible horrible catfish taste like crunchy cardboard .
so-so cole slaw and dry meat .
coleslaw was only tolerable , to soupy and peppery .
the food was lousy .
the sauce was weak .
but the ribs were horrible .
this place really needs an overhaul .
you do n't know barbeque that 's for sure .
this was a huge disappointment !
cashier was n't friendly .
wo n't be back .
did they change owners ?
lunch at honey bears bbq today .
the food was n't very tasty .
as expected from the response , it was mediocre .
never again ... never ... again .
went in today with my friend .
the collard greens lacked flavor and they were cold .
and the bun was just sad .
the young guy taking our order seemed completely confused .
i 'm not sure what came out .
the guy just did n't care .
the chicken was disgusting .
it was dry , the outside was hard .
i was really not impressed with the bbq here .
i nor my son wanted to eat it .
the ribs were inconsistent .
none of them were fall off the bone good .
my mac and cheese was just ... not right .
the corn on the cobb was hot but old .
by the looks of it only the reviewers care .
how many ways can you spell disappointed !
the chicken did not taste fresh .
the bun should have at least been toasted .
yes , that must be it .
do n't tell me you have n't noticed .
maybe i missed it .
it seriously ruined our trip .
i 've never seen anything like that before .
i was fairly disappointed with this zoo .
it 's way too hot .
what a horrible idea !
what a waste of time !
the worst thing about this zoo is the price .
a small salad costs $ _num_ .
a bottle of water is $ _num_ .
this is primarily a hot weather zoo .
the animal selection was pathetic .
$ _num_ for a bottle of soda !
$ _num_ for a hot dog !
did n't see much !
take your money elsewhere .
it was ok , but just ok .
zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair .
a frozen lemonade was almost $ _num_ !
will not return , one time is enough .
the animals are old , often hiding behind something .
it is highly over priced .
food was not the best .
worst interaction with any employee ever .
the price point was ridiculous as well .
and the people at the zoo missed some opportunities .
some animals were out but most were not .
do n't get the chicken sandwich its gross !
big deal when it 's _num_ degrees out .
_num_ stars might be two too many .
do n't waste your time .
general adult admission $ _num_ .
the animals look hot and tired .
$ _num_ to the airport via taxi .
not so much here .
whole city block is out of water .
not very marriott if you ask me .
not impressed with this locale .
this is not a corporate marriott !
dont waste your money here !
i was so confused what was happening .
not a vacation destination .
car was broken into .
i 'm out over $ _num_ .
trash was still in the trash bins .
strange locked closet in my room .
absolute bs - your _num_ miles from the airport .
absolute joke of a hotel with completely ignorant staff .
avoid this place at all costs .
um burrito or taco ?
not a tough one , and no special order .
no way , jose .
just not worth the aggravation .
did n't give me a straw .
did n't put the lime in the fish tacos .
no lemon in my ice tea .
like taco bell , but not as fancy .
the friday night bartender was great but she quit !
there is no hot water .
roaches are still present anywhere there is a drain .
garbage stays on the grounds for days .
the water goes off without warning .
the sidewalk and stairs too .
i 'm confused why it is n't allowed now .
you 're not allowed shade ?
not a good year at all .
the gate seems to be always broken .
two tires has been stolen .
i no longer feel safe living here .
absolute worst apartments ever !
`` no code or key required ! ''
same complaints by different people .
do n't make the mistake that i did .
not impressed at all .
if i could leave a half star i would .
then she tells me they ran out of tamales .
worst food city , i 've ever been to .
worst apartments i have ever been in .
this place is extremely noisy !
they could n't have done it that fast .
the roaches never left .
but it was our $ _num_ .
this place is horrible .
management does n't care , defensive and rude .
maintenance problems take forever to get fixed .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
do n't waste your money .
do n't go here if you have small children .
this is a museum for _num_ and up .
children _num_ and under are free .
adults pay _num_ dollars as of jun _num_ .
her behavior was not appreciated and not appropriate .
i wo n't be going there again .
do n't let the outside appearance fool you !
needless to say ... do n't rent here .
this complex is not interested in customer service .
it 's been one ridiculous thing after the other .
i am so sick of this place !
horrible horrible property management !
luckily we never had any major repairs .
do not rent here .
staff in the front office is horribly rude .
they do n't care about their residents at all .
my dryer has not worked since i moved in .
it only gets worse .
awful awful awful place to live .
if i could give this _num_ stars i would .
their website for paying rent is terrible .
i wish there was a no star rating !
they are old apartments and are falling apart !
he just drove away !
which is really unreasonable .
it 's not safe any other direction .
otherwise the customer service was terrible .
none of the screens fit properly .
if i could rate in the negatives i would .
been two weeks and nothing has been done .
this is not the place to go for dinner .
i do n't need good customer service .
i 'm not expecting gourmet , either .
sure , come for lunch .
wow , this place is awful .
it 's a lot more like _num_ .
there is no fridge or ice maker .
and smoked brisket , oh yeah , smoked brisket .
the remote for the tv was broken .
the fire alarm is missing the battery .
the room was n't the cleanest .
the mattress is covered with dirty plastic .
if i could choose no stars i would .
there is nothing good about this property .
room was gross and walls were paper thin .
the environment was very sketchy and unsafe .
um ... check in time was 3pm ?
no , no , no and no !
it does n't even deserve a single star .
the room was flat out unclean .
i can not make this up .
i did n't even mention the kicker .
worst experience of my life .
hotel would not refund me my money .
honestly , that bad .
_num_ dollars would be too much .
the place is a `` no go '' !
_num_ light bulbs were missing in the bathroom .
my room did not have a working smoke alarm .
the water pressure was very good .
it is very close to sky harbor airport .
then we get our luggage and stuff is missing .
this hotel is not safe !
this hotel is bad !
can i rate a zero ?
do n't stay here though .
expedia what have you gotten me into ?
i was very disappointed .
please avoid this place at all costs .
easily the worst car wash ever .
they take no pride in their work .
i advise everyone to stay away from this hotel .
horrible place to stay .
i was a little disappointed .
very poor conditions , both fairways & greens .
also the green fee of $ _num_ is ridiculous .
sad because i hoped phoenix could do better .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
flavoring is not consistent .
the menu was unimpressive .
the food itself was more like seafood soup .
may be i was expecting too much .
the food ... was passable but not amazing .
the beef noodle soup was not tasty .
i will not be returning again .
i could n't eat any of it .
the egg roll was just gross .
do not use a mexican chef .
biggest mistake of the month .
the fried pork chops were way overcooked and dry .
the pork chops were worse though .
i will not be returning .
but again , this is not new york ... .
ancient chinese secret my ass .
poor service in the pharmacy is common .
pharmacy is entirely too slow .
my mistake that i wo n't make again .
could n't possibly be more annoyed .
terrible customer service , i wo n't be back .
the decisions were made above her .
why would you give out a dirty car ?
very difficult to see out while in reverse .
such a terrible customer service experience !
our mistake was doing this on a weekend .
i will never rent here again !
terrible phone customer service !
she gave the `` oh well '' attitude .
frustrating to say the least !
incredibly disappointed in this place .
the rice was old and hard .
i will never visit this place again .
the asada was in big , tough pieces .
pastor was literally chunks of ground pork .
green chile beef was practically inedible .
nothing of interest on the menu .
tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien .
service was also not good .
i have to say , it was terrible .
wo n't go again .
everything else was mediocre at best .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
moral of the story : gross .
a gigantic waste of time and money .
we 're so disappointed .
man , we were really looking forward to this .
there were warning signs right away .
but lots of other stuff did bother me .
everything else was bland ... including the hot pot .
just a bad customer service experience and average food .
i will not be returning to this place .
average to a little less than average .
however , their sauces were bland .
rice was a tad dry .
went in and was promptly seated .
apparently they did n't want to serve us .
bad service , so so food and dishonest representation .
problem is , the coupon did not state that .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
maybe my experience would have been better ?
probably the food but i doubt the service .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
it was water boiled spicy beef .
no offer to exchange it for something else .
bad customer service as far as i 'm concerned .
terrible food and service to match .
also too expensive for what you get .
the worst experience ever .
will never return here .
no middle ground will be offered .
cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce .
was n't expensive for the type of food served .
the food came out exactly _num_ minutes after ordering .
would never step foot in that place again .
staff was rude , unfriendly and unprofessional .
the food was over priced and too salty .
i asked for lunch special and she sounded lost .
this was my first time at sp .
however , service was terrible .
also , staff was rude .
the absolute worst restaurant experience in years .
ordered what he recommended and it was disgusting .
the owners should be ashamed .
walked in , host seating us without any greeting .
but i guess that is what sells ... .
i got _num_ bites in before i gave up .
named a sichuan palace but taste like panda express .
i could n't get through 1/4 of the cup .
i had such a bad stomach ache afterwards .
save your money and time , avoid this place .
i wo n't be ordering there again .
this place is unprofessional and a complete joke .
i am not a patient .
the building does n't even open til 8am .
this place is horrible .
paradise lost , one might say .
hotel is rather nasty .
not gon na be staying here again .
you 've lost me on this one .
lesson learned , eh jay ?
a couple of things he missed though .
and there were some bright spots .
still , avoid this one like the plague .
do n't waste your time or money here .
after _num_ minutes , no food .
i have had worse , but not often .
the cook on duty tonight was simply incompetent .
this is probably a bad thing .
to call this mediocre is generous .
ordered delivery , food was cold and bland .
worst general tso chicken ever tasted .
there was only one car in the parking lot .
this place is just awful .
the car charger will definitely be useful .
i thought i was buying that from costco .
turns out i was n't .
maybe i 'm doing it wrong .
why do i hate it so ... ?
wan na know why ?
terrible experience signing up for membership .
lots of inappropriate comments .
we already hate it here and we just joined .
not impressed so wo n't be buying that again .
seriously , this should n't be this difficult !
why could n't she do that ?
they must not want me as a customer .
however ... ... lines have been really slow lately .
waited _num_ minutes to get through .
there were _num_ people ahead of me !
i would give it zero stars if i could .
everything about this place is beyond awful .
in fact all of these clinics are terrible .
husband went about a year ago .
this actually looks like some sort of bite !
should n't the doctor have done that ?
please , do not waste your time and money .
i know i will never be back .
online system says check in to reserve your spot .
what i got was a charred hockey puck .
they seem on the up and up .
the food service is painfully slow .
i would recomend going here just for the experience .
not my cup of tea .
i will not go back .
shame on me for assuming things .
not a sweet tomatoes that 's for sure .
watery mac n cheese .
they take your money and off you go .
the food just was n't that good .
it just tasted really cheap .
ok , so i had the $ _num_ lunch .
tomatoes do not sweat .
had to ask for it , same with pizza .
noon and i 'm starving !
however this location does not deserve your business .
i simply ordered a veggie and cheese .
... ... end result ... .
pretty terrible experience here .
applebee 's is n't terrible .
the worst applebees in town .
it 's kinda my fault .
but the food was n't up to par .
spinach & artichoke appetizer was so-so .
my wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta .
the chicken breast was overcooked and dry .
do n't waste your time .
the server was over the top obnoxious .
the manager made me hate this place even more .
that was unacceptable to me !
i guess that does n't apply !
its probably another scam to bring customers in .
do not eat here .
i do n't like this location .
we have to flag him down .
i 'm so sorry to inconvenience you !
j 's and my food come out as ordered .
baby c does n't seem to mind .
he brings him dr. pepper instead .
i walked out wishing i went to chili 's .
no idea of organization or time management .
to wait too long .
i will not be going back for some time .
this experience was very frustrating .
anyway what a waste of time and money .
i said , `` are u kidding me ?
this place is awful to order togo from !
but for now , do n't go .
are food came _num_ minutes later .
i wish i would have said something .
do n't see any food coming out of kitchen .
so they are not too busy making food .
worst service i 've had ever !
they always play music way too loud .
he had _num_ beer prior .
i guess the cooks like everything rare !
the food did not taste good at all .
i was very disappointed with the food .
the theme for the lunch was dry .
the mac and cheese was ... dry .
the chicken was ... dry .
the wings were ... dry .
salsa was soo small there was no point .
fries were small portion and soggy .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
and my friends baked potato was rotten !
never again stepping foot in this place !
it 's pretty ridiculous .
if i order extra cheese they forget it .
i am very disappointed with this landscaping business .
right now i 'm really disappointed .
only frozen meat , one type of sausage .
i walked out without buying anything .
tacky , tacky , tacky .
i really like the mini chicken chimichangas .
greasy chips , tasteless watery salsa and horrible food !
i am not sure why people like this place .
but i have wasted enough money at their restaurants .
the margs were watery and low on the alcohol .
one word can describe this place gross !
the salsa was lame , the chips stale .
things have taken a big turn for the worse .
its hard to find anything under $ _num_ .
the baja sauce lost its kick .
the guac had no flavor .
i regret eating here .
-- salsa _num_ to _num_ days old .
-- refried beans go the same way .
did n't finish them ?
-- sopapillas for shame !
you could n't force feed me this shit !
the dish was n't appetizing at all .
just drop off the check and walk away .
worst mango and strawberry margaritas ever !
they got one order completely wrong .
i have never done that before .
the carpeting is tired .
not even a jar -- a can .
overpriced , stale fast-food .
no wonder the taco was burnt .
the decor is just awful .
macayos is like chuck e. cheese without the games .
my meal was relatively flavorless .
the bar : very disappointed .
poor set up with entrance outside the restaurant .
the chimichanga was awful .
huge , but awful .
it was soggy and bland .
the cheese crisp should be skipped .
there 's no flavor .
salsa tastes like it 's made from canned tomatoes .
chicken chimichanga was ok .
the service is horrible and bartenders are very rude .
oh my gosh , they were even worse !
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
today i still have an after taste of grease .
this clearly does n't describe this place .
no , no , no , no .
the service was fine but the food was awful .
this place has gone downhill .
that was a mistake .
so disappointing to see what has happened here .
i really expected it to be better .
just do n't waste your money on them .
the food is decent but bland .
flat , old tasting soda .
i will never go to that location again !
never even addressed the terrible service we received !
the place itself needs to be remodeled .
like its out fault we did n't get service ?
i 'm never returning to this macayos !
this place has a serious staffing problem .
poor service , dirty restroom .
bland is a complement .
taco bell has more seasonings .
i wo n't go back .

the single worst dinning experience .
forgot drinks and was rude .
was very very disappointed with this location .
our booth was equally gross .
there was hair stuck up in it with food .
not to the one on central .
there was n't a second bite .
the service is just downright mean .
i have been here twice , year 's apart .
but this burrito was practically swimming with it .
i could n't eat more than half .
$ _num_ wasted and apparently they sent an upgrade !
unfortunately our room key did n't work .
no there was no one outside .
again no one there to help .
i would not recommend this particular hotel .
the wifi is super slow at night .
the wifi at hilton was exactly the opposite .
the service here is horrific !
the pool also never had towels .
ugh where to begin ?
i would give this place a negative _num_ rating .
i could smell them cooking bacon in the morning .
wo n't be coming back here unfortunately .
they 're getting _num_ stars only for customer service .
the first time , it was n't bad .
the second sandwich was another veggie .
i called again and spoke to monica again .
i threw it away .
delivery service is ridiculous .
the fries are usually lukewarm .
the prices are just stupid .
i also do n't cook a lot .
all this hype for nothing .
this place has no natural foods .
why not just go to fry 's or safeway ?
_num_ corned beef steak remains .
_num_ stars for the awesome beer selection .
a turkey sandwich no mayo i say .
smh ... wont be back .
sadly , i am not exaggerating this in anyway .
the last straw for me happened last week .
i went to the deli area to get breakfast .
super disappointed with my treatment at the aj 's .
the crust was just so tough .
avoid this store at all costs in the afternoon .
they are cheap money hungry people !
they lie to get your money .
really bad experience today .
i 'll be avoiding going back .
one star is too many .
_num_ on the sandwich , total waste of money .
rude is what this place is .

they were watery and barely edible .
_num_ walked away and gave up .

my boyfriend ordered a philly i ordered raviolis .
the pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting !
watery and not filled with goodness .
toppings were not fresh at all .
streets of ny pizza was mediocre .
it was $ _num_ per topping .

the antipasto was okay but not worth the cost .
the italian beef sandwich was awful .
the little bread appetizers was a plus .

just thought we would give it another try .
zero stars should really be an option .
taste was just fair .

customer service is horrible here .
when we got our food , it was awful .
probably the worst mexican food i ever had .
the service at this location was terrible !
more like mediocre burrito !

only a last resort .
this place just did n't do it for me .
third , the service sucks .
i have to copy stephanie b 's review below .
i could n't agree more .
third , the service sucks .
so a hit and a two misses .
ok , uh , what ?
she said they could n't do that .
the decor is painfully cute .
why not just make something that tastes good ?
but i wo n't be doing it again .
she again told me no .
she again told me no .
drove _num_ minutes to have a meal here .
waste of my time to try a new place .
ummmm that 's weird , but fine .
_num_ mins later , we are done eating .
this place is foul .
overall , a disappointing experience .
huge , let me repeat this , huge mistake !
that was a completely wasted lunch for me .
disappointing & unfriendly staff .
they should stick to pizza !
the food was cold .
i had soggy french toast .
the chai tea was lukewarm but tasted okay .
the meat was salty and tasteless .
i sat down at a table .
i simply got up and walked out .
did she just not want our money that day ?
for this and the cider alone i 'm returning .
this took the _num_ to a _num_ .
unfortunately , the food is not so great .
i 'm not sure what was up with that .
this place just is n't good enough .
hair in food is just plain gross .
beer selection was good , but food was terrible .
i could not believe this bar served food .
nothing about it said restaurant .
could i have asked for our server ?
what a waste of time !
steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney ?
g & d was a sad day for me .
menu for food was quite typical .
it 's got a bit of a negative vibe .
it 's just not fun anymore .
so long , george .
it tasted like weak kool-aid .
i would rather spend my money elsewhere .
our wait staff was non existent .
she never bothered to check on us once .
it tasted like water before .
any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice .
would have given it zero stars .
the waitress was awful .
i would n't recommend this place at all ... .
but the service was inexcusable .
unfortunately , it 's not pleasant .
wo n't be back .
but time has not been kind to this place .
unfortunately it was a huge let down .
i just do n't get it .
do not waste time nor money on this place .
the place is noisy and dirty .
owner is one angry nasty person .
this place is worse than terrible .
the food is equally terrible .
i refused because it was not my drinks .
that 's not how to work with the community .
i ca n't order from the bar .
she would n't even bring me my card .
wo n't be back .
not only this visit , several past visits .
bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks .
did i mention there were only _num_ patrons .
seems like management is non existent .
even then it was n't all that great .
probably will not be back .
george and dragon sucks .
she made no effort to correct this gross service .
if i could give less i would .
the food is somehow worse than before ?
the butt end and that was it .
the french fries were awful .
i feel bad for the waitresses .
wish i could give no stars on this one .
our food did n't arrive for _num_ mins .
and overall the food sucked .
she still got it wrong .
she was just getting everything wrong .
she somehow has lost his card .
so overall , my experience here was a nightmare .
you will never catch me in that place again .
could a fooled me !
make this an unappealing place to hang out .
most miserable worst experience ever .
mashed potatoes and cold bits of hamburger .
this place will not earn our business again .
their food is n't much better .
they are consistency awful .
it was a huge portion of bland food .
sad thing is the service is worse than before .
waitress brought out a drink with water and ice .
really does n't matter .
i 'm not coming back .
sunday noon , about _num_ patrons .
beer was chilled , not cold .
there was no issue with that .
never come to take an order .
so , i gave him the job .
very frustrating to say the least !
i said nothing and walked .
these people are idiots .
horrible service , horrible attitudes .
it was very disappointing .
just went here to discuss getting some items printed .
i would not recommend this office at all .
i hardly trusted them to give it another go .
her assistant immediately complemented me on my boring skirt .
the girls were nice but my make up sucked .
i would not recommend this place .
we wo n't be going back .
nothing broke nor even fell over .
i recomend no one shop here .
horrible business ethics all around .
really now , get over yourself .
he is rude and arrogant .
there 's too much junk otherwise .
incredibly poor , aweful service .
he does n't even deserve _num_ star .
i wish i could give him no stars .
treats grown ups like little children .
i wish i can give zero stars .
i am never going back or buying there .
do n't waste your time .
the owner of this store deserves no stars !
i do not understand how he stays in business .
i desperately missed my down dogs .
this place does not even deserve a one star !
this place simply nasty .
honestly , made me sick .
i would never suggest this place to anyone .
smelly , moldy and just plain gross !
this time i was being charge $ _num_ ?
he then walks off .
stay far far away !
this place is an absolute joke .
avoid this place at all costs !
this store lost my package .
they were nice though .
poor customer service for the owner !
i checked my po box and no package .
he said there was nothing wrong with the bike .
he said it was the way i rode it .
i wore my station hat in the pig .
eric became all sorts of friendly and helpful .
the service sucks at the pig .
buy your bike else where , like tempe bikes .
a week after that and it was not done .
two stars for their work , zero for service .
i get it , you 're busy .
but back to the pig .
eric again was not willing to help .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this review is no different .
ignore me once , shame on you .
ignore me twice , shame on me .
bottom line , i do n't recommend this place .
bang bang bang bang !
out the door , $ _num_ for repairs .
customer service very , very poor !
i certainly will not patronize this place again .
they wo n't make it right .
and do n't bother complaining to the manager .
hubby insisted we had eaten here before .
i ordered the taco salad for my lunch .
this salad was not worth $ _num_ .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
good food , poor service .
but today it should have been called suck eggs .
the service is ok but the food was terrible !
i had eggs benedict and i was greatly disappointed !
he comes back with cream , no napkins .
friend _num_ had an even more crispy looking omelet .
friend _num_ got a turkey sandwich .
check your cold storage bins people !
friend _num_ has a major strawberry allergy .
boy was i wrong .
the food was bland and not good at all .
the food is bland and unhealthy .
the price is cheap but not a bargain .
the service is mediocre to poor .
my gf decided french toast was fine .
no info on the ingredients .
he 's super pissed at this point .
basically told me i was s out of luck .
very unfortunate customer service .
this was not a custom mix either .
and even that was n't good .
after waiting half an hour i requested a refund .
they did refund my money .
just do n't go there to eat .
apparently my order was n't anywhere in their system .
i did n't care .
so they ca n't blame it on remodeling confusion .
they are just dumb .
he let out another sigh .
skip this place and make an appointment somewhere else !
feel free to take your money elsewhere . ''
i am taking my business elsewhere .
so i get hung up again .
says there 's nothing he can do .
not that great in volleyball .
aaron brothers we 're overpriced mart .
aaron brothers got your ass yelped on yelp mart .
how the hell do they stay in business ?
the service was horrible !
this place needs better service .
worst customer service ever .
such a rude rude rude woman .
is n't that what they signed up for ?
my sister was treated so rude .
and my god was i disappointed .
i highly recommend you skip wendy 's for breakfast .
my kudos to that poor woman .
will not be back to this location .
this place has gone downhill .
every time i get the wrong items .
i 'm getting real tired of it .
it 's seriously not that hard .
it really was n't busy .
this is getting ridiculous .
but they have baked potatoes .
what other fast food joint has baked potatoes ?
they 're out of baked potatoes .
not spicy at all .
this was a total disappointment .
i would give it no stars if i could .
the management was none too concerned .
there is almost a screw up every time .
the coordinator for phoenix va should be ashamed .
( make that _num_ minutes ... .
worst customer service ever !
it 's _num_ months between appointments .
i think that is a shame in itself .
you should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves .
this place is an absolute joke .
the blood draw itself took under _num_ seconds total .
i accepted this appointment , having no other choice .
having no other choice i accepted this new appointment .
no actual health care being done anymore !
the parking is ridiculous .
this place really need to be more organized .
this place has a bad reputation for a reason .
a mistake here would definitely cause some serious problems !
that is totally unacceptable !
fast food salad , pasta and pizza .
the salad was your standard plate of bland greens .
it also cost more than it should .
car stuff 's expensive .
the autozone kid was super helpful though .
came across a very terrible worker here .
could not help me for nothing .
this store is no longer open .
the poor wait staff .
and the food is just not good .
i was very disappointed to say the least .
will never i back .
their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning .
wait time , well _num_ min .
terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour .
not coming back to this particular applebees .
wait was terrible on a late thursday night .
food came out , cold and or overcooked .
the entrees are not that great .
the food is n't worth that kind of treatment .
was not happy with the food !
he brought us _num_ napkins & _num_ forks .
very disappointing & a terrible experience .
next time attempt to act like you care .
none have ever been great .
she just wrote down the wrong thing .
our meal was ruined .
this is the worst applebee 's ever .
staff was friendly , restaurant was moderately clean .
after much discussion they cooked another egg .
i wo n't be back .
this place is ridiculous .
meal was overall gross !
too many other good restaurants in phoenix .
no one ever apologized at all .
drove _num_ minutes out to come to applebee 's .
i was very disappointed in the quality of food !
_num_ percent chance this is me .
i ca n't stand castle boutique .
stopped in here a few months back .
why does phoenix not have better sex toy stores ?
staff seems a bit apathetic .
you ca n't even give me a `` hello .
i was waiting on you .
it 's not even a cheese shop .
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
well folks , you yelpers here are totally fooled !
both dishes were supposed to be hot ... not !
it was very meh .
it was very bland .
really not sure what the fuss is about .
i do not understand why people love china chili .
i wo n't be coming back .
over priced mediocre food .
it really had no flavor at all .
sweet and sour chicken .
will not be back .
the service is friendly but lacking .
that is not good chinese food .
my first review of china chili was _num_ stars .
i like it spicey but this was just sour .
this is direct cause and effect .
meantime there is no way i would ever return .
the prawns were good but nothing special .
i only ate _num_ or _num_ bites .
the sesame chicken was the same way .
i was not impressed at all .
nothing to write home about .
it did n't wow me .
oh no no no no !
i will not be back !
the taste of the chicken was gross .
not good at all .
the crab puffs were awesome .
i will not be returning though .
the food is underwhelming !
just the worst chinese food ever .
you will be disappointed that you did n't listen .
pretty disappointed after reading other reviews .
overpriced chinese food and only tasted mediocre at most .
we never got enough silverware or soup bowls .
i also told her the soup was cold .
they always have an excuse !
i will never spend another dollar in that establishment .
the atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated .
so i only ate half of each .
we returned the beef because it was not edible .
they get five star 's it was the food .
rather get of pf changs or pei wei .
even panda express does n't use msg .
it 's bad stuff .
however , the food was very bland .
even the egg rolls were bland .
unfortunately i can not recommend this restaurant .
something has changed big time !
find a better florist , they 're out there .
will not be using them again .
there is a huge lack in management here .
these are just plan bad .
i just paid $ _num_ for two drinks .
the kale is n't fresh it 's frozen .
the drinks are good but not worth the price .
no greeting ... nothing .
no offer to help .
i will urge anyone i know to stay away .
they then price them up using various price guides .
not much love for music just about making money .
average drink prices these days , nothing special .
it was amazingly gross .
i 'm never going back to this location again .
this used to be my daughter 's favorite restaurant .
i took one and it was cold and soggy .
it was cold , creamy and without any flavoring .
i will not be returning .
is n't it a buffet ?
lost their lease , building to be torn down .
these guys have no class what so ever .
they made a big issue out of nothing .
these guys are the terrible !
so , i figured i would try it .
we went through the drive-thru around 8pm last wednesday .
veggies and chicken were okay too .
i guess the whole bowl was just okay .
the sauce served with them were good though .
this is a $ _num_ bowl of disgusting crap .
i do n't care .
it comes out to about $ _num_ per bowl .
unable to complete simple orders .
secondly the rice was not well cooked .
over that time the service has declined tremendously .
( referring to a veggie sushi roll item ) .
i looked at the employee and she just shrugged .
do n't get the old blond lady !
nope , i 'm not going back !
they lost my lunch business for today .
just looked like it needed some cleaning .
no one got sick so probably fine too .
i find this very strange and annoying .
i am disgusted with the restaurant !
talked to someone else .
wo n't be back .
it is like i am a joke to them .
worse property management company i have encountered !
very unhappy with both .
for _num_ years never one complaint .
he is still not satisfied .
get a better vendor .
if i could leave _num_ stars i would .
worst hoa i have ever had .
update your technology and your slow unhelpful staff .
very weak management company in my opinion .
for about _num_ pieces of pepper and onion .
hard times , qdoba ?
i need some now .
she says they have been slow all day .
was located near starbucks but no longer there .
the real negative for me was the restroom .
however , that is not their problem .
their business practices are awful .
i am _num_ for _num_ .
ok , way out of my price range .
not ethical in my books .
there still is n't an answer .
not to mention yogurt etc .
really hurt by the experience .
then why did i pay $ _num_ ?
complete waste of time any money !
seriously i want my $ _num_ back .
i just was n't impressed .
hardly anyone was there .
well , she did n't get it .
the layout of the place was somewhat unusual .
the service was awful .
nothing good or personable about it .
at that point i 'm never coming back .
the weather was fabulous .
she returned a few minutes later for our order .
atmosphere was very lame for a thursday night .
even the root beer was flat and tasteless .
i really , really want to like it .
mediocre food ... if it was what i ordered .
shrimp tacos : way too salty and overcooked .
for the price food was n't that great either .
it was also a bit dry .
no salt , no vinegar , nothing .
my favorites were the hefeweizen and vanilla porter .
very disappointed in their service .
i will not be back .
the problem lies with the horrible service .
it took another _num_ minutes on top of that .
never once did anyone bother telling me what happened .
honestly , no one even gave a sh*t either .
my buddy even commented on that after we left .
no one even cared .
i wo n't be going back .
i hate being asked , then end up disappointed .
starting off , the pasta was over cooked .
i really doubt we will return .
not impressed at all .
poor service , decent beer , poor food .
very disappointing and not worth the money .
probably _num_ tortilla chips .
unfortunately we both left hungry .
my drink was empty the entire time .
beers that were listed they also did not have .
however , i find this highly unacceptable .
not a good vibe at all .
not awful - just not good either .
staff was a plus .
very awkward and inconvenient lay out .
this place is tired on every level .
never again - not recommended .
we thought is was cheap vinyl .
the bed was awful .
the linens were not hilton quality .
overpriced & horrible housekeeping !
i was not comped .
motel _num_ service at a hilton price .
just stay somewhere else & save yourself the frustration .
the employee did not take the smelly blanket away .
i would absolutely not recommend staying at this hotel .
everything about this hotel screamed tired .

no one to fix at night .
the thermostat had to be _num_ years old .
property could not fix .
old , tired property .
worst hotel stay in years .
i was scheduled to stay _num_ nights .
here are why i am giving only _num_ stars .
it could use a renovation .
not good for kids .
not good for dogs .
i wish i had never gone .
you just lost your company a regular client lady .
front office is very unprofessional and rude .
just trying to get more money .
at least not with the same one ?
my neck is awful , it looked better before .
just disgusted that i threw my money away .
so , so unhappy .
the receptionists treated me poorly .
it 's starbucks only with bad customer service .
when i buy _num_ or more .
they will not be getting anymore of my money .
right now my pizza is _num_ minutes late .
i got no where which the corporate office also .
she supposedly even called .
worst customer service ever .
( they never let me finish it ) .
at least she was n't chewing gum .
going over to another agency ... sigh .
she was n't very friendly while working with me .
i drove an hour total through this whole process .
i am _num_ months here , i got lost .
what a horrible system .
i wo n't stop .
i kinda felt like it was disorganized .
dont waste your time !
it was a waste of time and gas .
i would waste time with them .
disappointing turnover with grill chefs .
a monkey could have done a better job !
i will never attend this salon again !
$ _num_ for a gel fill ?
not customer friendly at all .
why is this my fault !
and you do bad work !
i had the worst experience here .
it was dirty , unsanitary , and way overpriced !
i would never ever go back to this place .
this place is so dirty and unprofessional .
avoid at all cost !
i will not be coming back .
i payed $ _num_ for sh*t acrylics .
that is not what i asked for .
i can not tell you how upset i was .
she needs to go back to beauty school .
it is honestly not hard to match a picture .
unless you have an appointment , do n't bother .
their time management is n't very good .
my daughter & i went in for a pedicure .
this place does n't make you feel welcome .
`` what the hell just happened ? ''
not even _num_ min !
not my favorite strip club by a long shot .
her : ca n't .
her : fuck you , you pig .
i would not consider this a gentlemen club .
and it 's some kind of harsh house vodka .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
i do n't like getting the cold shoulder .
the staff at this store is very rude .
as though i were in the wrong place .
but , it sound horrible .
i wo n't be going back .
took one bite of the salsa , that was it.
threw a buck in the table and walked out .
nothing too special about this place .
i was severely disappointed .
the service was horrible .
the staff was friendly , just incredibly slow .
granted , the restaurant was full .
i 've had better mexican food in alaska .
wo n't be going here again .
the chips and salsa were eh , ok .
the food was bland and not too flavorful .
i was disappointed with this dish .
it was greasy and had too much cheese .
it was also fairly bland .
visited juan 's after reading the numerous complementary reviews .
do yourself a favor and skip this one .
the flavor was very blah .
chips and salsa were old and tasteless .
really , really bad .
i do n't get it .
the bill was $ _num_ !
over priced and not even that great .
horrible service , whether busy or not .
pizza is always limp , soggy or undercooked .
pizza cookie is ok .
go to scottsdale or tempe location instead .
drinks refills took longer than they should have .
not bad , but ok.
this review is not for the food.
this would have been repeat business no less .
as far as pizza goes ... um no thanks .
are you freakin kidding me ?
you did nothing right in this transaction .
it was almost laughable .
for lunch , really ?
it did n't even look like calamari .
it was thick strips that tasted very very fishy .
we sent it back and ordered fried ravioli .
really bad for business .
not what i want to see .
no worries , that does not bother me really .
however recently something seems a miss .
i barely finished one slice .
it was bland & tasteless and way too oily .
it was simply the worst lasagna we ever had .
the hot wings were not good .
i would not recommend this place .
food was good , service was terrible .
the whole experience was rude .
will not be back at this location again .
this is no exaggeration .
there is really , seriously no place to park .
everything i ordered was less than awesome .
awful experience this week .
a quarter of the salad was not edible .
those people just do n't care .
we had the worst service ever !
i was so disappointed !

sorry , not much positive to say .
i was craving alfredo .

the worst experience ever .
our _num_ minute wait was close to an hour .
no apology and definitely no better service .
longest hour of my life so far !

shrimp diablo was too hot .
i love spices food but this was ridiculous .
no bargains here on lunch entree costs .
will not be coming back and would n't recommend .
dip was good , artichokes were a little tough .
the pizza is sooo marginal .
there was barely any pineapple on it .
i will not be back to this place again !
i was so mad at that point .
the place is clearly slow .
this was such an awful experience .
very weak knock off of chicago style pizza .
crust was ok and the pizza sauce was bitter .
i was disgusted by their customer service .
overall a complete waste of money .
ate here yesterday and i 'm never going back .
overall this place was just a let down .
both visits here were not the best .
it 's the service that seems to be lacking .
man , do i pity dana 's employees .
they have ignored it .
however , the problem just occurred again today .
do n't mind me just getting excited over ranch .
this garbage is the epitome of , well garbage .
the bad news is the prices are outrageous .
true value usually has lower prices too .
ace i am disappointed in you .
do not get keys made here !
i am so annoyed with this ace .
one of the keys still does n't fit .
i 've shopped here several times too many .
the dishwasher sucks big time !
i can not wait to move out .
the place is still very loud around the apartments .
_num_ cheeseburgers a fry and a drink .
i was there approximately noon .
emails and messages are rarely returned .
you will not be satisfied as an owner .
no meat , no seasoning , no nothing .
went tonight and ordered a large _num_ cheese pizza .
o m g american cheese ?
are you kidding me ?
it was _num_ with a drink .
so sad to see this neighborhood gem go veggie .
the italian was to die for .
service was slow and rude .
so , i trusted him and did that .
see , i do n't really like this place .
and i , quite frankly , remain unimpressed .
seared tuna ... was far from seared .
sushi rice was a bit soggy too .
i ordered the clams in broth .
sushi was n't bad , not awesome .
i opted for the shrimp udon soup .
i ordered pad thai no tofu again mild .
how can you go wrong with pad thai .
the noodles were so over cooked it was disgusting .
that 's the only good thing i can say .
i have not been back .
that is n't what is wrong with cherry blossom .
the server never brought it to me .
the sushi was c grade .
passable but not anything i would return for .

first , bad service .
waiter did not bring us a bread .
sushi quality was bad .
yakisoba noodle was burned .
husband had chicken parm .
is that my noodles were not good !
wth was going on .
honestly , i probably wo n't be going back .
it was n't bad , just was n't special .
also - the food was very bland .
not a hint of kick to it at all .
however , the service was less than stellar .
there was hardly any miso in the soup .
an insult to the patron of the restaurant .
how lazy can this restaurant get !
i know it is sealed but , really ?
not impressed at all .
what a waste of my precious hard earned money .
turned out that was a big mistake .
the other one was even worse .
i wo n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
barely acknowledged when you first walked in .
will not come again .
this was our 3rd visit to cherry blossom .
service was terrible and food was below average .
the salmon sashimi was not good .
i really wanted noodles , ie a noodle bar .
the waiter was short and was very impersonal .
there were only two other tables being served too .
but the employee culture is greatly lacking .
bread was basic bread , nothing special .
that 's why i spend money in a restaurant !
lots of supermarket stuff , at a premium price .
so why did i even bother trying this place ?
it was very busy .
this is not the first time it 's happened .
the sushi all tasted fishy .
the worst experience i 've ever had .
they were not wrapped properly and just fell apart !
they also serve italian food , kind of weird .
its not the typical hole in the wall feel .
got the pad thai and added chicken .
i am so disappointed and insulted .
i probably wont b back .
surprised with all the yelp reviews ... disappointed .
is there no manager !
so , no good news here .
the place was totally empty .
the only other customer in the place was leaving .
i then immediately walked out !
neither were very good .
ramen was too salty and the udon was bland .
the sushi is about par with the grocery stores .
my biggest gripe is the terribly slow service !
he apologized and tried to make it better .
i just was speechless at this point .
i left with utter disappointment .
nope , not the case at all !
it does n't make any sense at all .
this is my first yelp review ever .
the worst place i have ever been too .
not impressed with the ambience or menu .
food is about average , service is too bad .
we had dinner tonight and tried several dishes .
the rice was a little hard .
however , the service was really bad .
it took _num_ mins to get my menus .
the staffs were unfriendly and gave off weird vibes .
terrible service and overrated ramen and dessert .
dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so .
can not believe the male server is still there .
he was rushing me and was extremely rude .
udon soup as did my co worker .
bad service and bad food .
this place is pretty amazing !
she just walked away and never came back .
the food is mediocre and not worth coming back !
no pictures of the noodles but minimum description .
i do n't like katsu .
the curry alone was not appetizing .
my food was lukewarm if even warm .
the food is awsome .
absolutely do not recommend this doctor or his staff .
i lost $ _num_ on a $ _num_ purchase .
my experience was not pleasant .
ca n't say the same for this place .
no online ability to take money .

do n't know how this store stays in business .
we had _num_ minutes to travel _num_ miles .
he could have cared less .
i wish your business luck for the future .
the price of the lens is $ _num_ retail .
this place is the absolute worst .
she then hung up on me .
do n't bother coming here .
mexican pizza was extremely gross .
do n't go at night terrible service .
big taco bell fan just not this location .
but this is ridiculous .
to the empty kitchen .
out of beans , beef , and chicken .
what a poorly ran establishment .
i was having some brake trouble last week .
the buttons were off of it .
no one apologized still for it .
they do n't deserve it !
saved myself $ _num_ .
the 7th st location is a scam shack .
$ _num_ in tax ?
for all of you , please be warned .
i genuinely cant believe people can be that dishonest !
either way , strike _num_ of many .
it was not done .
i was certainly wrong .
you have been warned .
11am i called for update .
however , i had my first frustrating experience .
this is horrible business .
i sincerely apologize for what happened last night .
it 's been over _num_ hours ?
normally we 're down the street at camelback toyota .
neat looking place , terrible customer service .
( so extremely rude ! )
i will not be going back !
no exaggeration on that !
the first repair was n't even the problem .
the next step would be a class action case .
terrible service for repairs .
i had never been so offended in my life .
i could not hear any more .
funky house salad with a creamy ranch ( ? )
dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato .
the chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing .
first time but never again !
disgusting food , terrible service .
food is adequate but not authentic .
ok , this is entirely sad .
but , not this new year 's eve .
bread , butter , olive oil ?
here 's my problem .
not tonight and that 's sincerely sad .
not up to their par .
it smells like mold & cleaner gone wrong .
not a pleasant experience after the drive .
i have never been treated so bad .
i will not use them ever again .
poor customer service all the way around !
instead , they had it for _num_ days .
very rude and very unpleasant & very unprofessional !
those two women should n't even have a job !
i would never recommend this collision center to anyone .
both cupcakes were made from a mix .
neither my husband nor i cared for it .
this just set me off .
sound 's good does n't it .
i 'll spend my money there .
says it 's kosher , but apparently only sometimes .
they could not help me .
everything else leaves me flat .
if she would let me use my card .
it was really uncomfortable ... .
she just stared at me .
so , i purchased _num_ pastries and got out .
i walked in and looked at the cases .
so , here 's a run down .
puff pastry was flavorless .
however , i did like the service !
: ( that made me incredibly sad .
i have never cried so hard in my life !
seriously , i was a wreck .
honestly , it 's just not any good .
not horrible but i doubt i 'll be back .
i do not like saturdays here .
like , under _num_ young .
did i get the word rude in there ?
nick does n't work on saturdays .
it 's just crap .
they were just too drunk to care .
not true and not cool .
i informed them and all i got was sorry .
all in all , fuck that place .
this place is not a local dive bar .
our experience here was crappy .
i ca n't believe she has a job there .
she just did n't deserve anything .
unless there is another and nicer bartender on duty .
the missing _num_ stars .
learn from my mistake , and stay away .
$ _num_ down the drain .
the dealership was less than this repair shop .
and advised me with what i needed help with .
you know i am a paying customer too .
what a horrible place to get service work done .
i repeat do not !
i would n't feed that to my dog .
rude lazy people who do n't care .
none of the food i saw looked appetizing .
it was so noisy too and smelled like animals !
thanks but no thanks , i left .
i would not recommend them to anyone .
i will not be returning .
i would never go back again .
the wait time for my appointment was long .
would not recommend this office to anyone .
complete waste of my money .
if u could give _num_ stars i totally would .

this guy is crazy for charging such a price .
i was very disappointed .
the beer battered zucchini rings were over salted .
ate there awhile back and will not be back .
food was terrible and way overpriced .
very rude and uncaring .
the food is exact opposite of chicago food .
the overall experience has kept me from going back .
we walked in and we were not greeted .
what a waste of time and money .
kept wanting to drive back and let them know .
do n't have a grill ?
i guess that made up for the mediocre food .
this place is nothing to write home about .
fries are not so great .
i will not go back , ever .
it was a saturday night but wasnt too busy .
ordered the bacon cheeseburger , nothing fancy .
when i got it , it was half cooked .
i am not sure how that happens .
i was overwhelmed by the choices .
i went with lunch during breakfast time .
there 's a dead fly in my fruit cup .
did we catch them on a bad night ?
absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment .
not my first time here , definitely my last .
no discount , no nothing .
at best , hit and miss .
food - not so good .
i 've eaten here twice for breakfast .
makes denny 's like like it deserves _num_ stars .
my wife 's special scramble was equally bad .
the taste of the food was off .
what kids do n't deserve a decent meal ?
it tasted like cardboard .
had some high hopes for this one .
well , my wife and i just left disappointed .
we probably wo n't be coming back here again .
instead of onion rings they gave me fries .
the sauce on it was horrible she said .
disappointed that our visit was n't better .
the food was horrible !
strips were really hard as well .
just a disgusting plate to eat !
two people coast _num_ .
the food was cheap in taste .
both times , the meat was overcooked and dry .
the small amount of macaroni cheese old .
friendly server , but i wo n't be back .
_num_ minutes later , we were still completely ignored .
i 'm totally disgusted with this place tonight .
manager , you should be ashamed .
where 's my meatloaf !
we sat for _num_ min , and left .
this was the worst service i 've ever had .
i 've shopped here before .
customer service was not that great .
rude lady would n't go back in ever .
she 's very condescending sounding .
tanks are way overpriced .
do n't let online pictures fool you !
it was actually kind of a pathetic looking sandwich .
unfortunately that 's exactly what happened this past saturday .
apparently that threw the kid totally off .
this set me off .
but they always get my order wrong .
i was so embarrassed .
my fries and onion rings are covered in salt .
it is so unhealthy and gross !
the chicken there is n't even real .
the cashier did not even apologize for the wait .
they got my order wrong .
i just do n't get it .
this place is horrible !
this place is horrible !
so i spent about $ _num_ that night .
so watch your bags !
get the hell over yourself !
and that 's it , she cut me off .
are you kidding me ?
and that 's it , she cut me off .
are you kidding me ?
no bread , no pita bread .
my experience was horrible .
it has apparently not changed in that many years .
it was overly spiced , and drowned in sauce .
there was no taste of salmon to be found .
i wo n't be back .
do not waste youre time going here !
and my bill would not have been _num_ $ .
enter stage left , a host .
it was dry and not tasty .
nothing to really yelp about .
i was extremely disappointed .
it was pretty bad .
none of it was good .
service is totally crap .
this was n't all that impressive .
calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere .
my meal was awful .
everything did n't taste like it should .
will not be coming back here .
our drinks ran dry and the service was terrible .
i will not be back .
wow i feel sorry for this place .
the place was empty , only one other table .
this is just a depressing store .
it 's not fancy .
it 's not particularly clean .
but , i really have n't .
i waited for _num_ minutes and they never opened .
do not go to this place !
would not recommend to anyone .
i 'd recommend you just skip this place .
not worth my time nor money .
hit or miss here .
tonight , pedi was okay and mani was awful .
they refunded me for the manicure , at least .
i will not be a returning customer .
waited _num_ minutes they forgot about us we waited .
_num_ more minutes and they were super rude .
have now taken _num_ customers ahead of me .
not a thorough pedicure what 's so ever .
nobody was waiting after me .
i will not be going back .
poured most of it down the drain instead .
this last visit really made me mad .
either way , i 've made my final visit .
i can get a hot drink elsewhere .
but , things have recently gone downhill .
next time ill just come earlier .
i like your bagels !
einstein , what is it you make ?
i wo n't bother to stop again .
ordered a thin bagel toasted .
literally some of the most incompetent people working here .
also their restrooms are disgusting .
too bad this place has worst service !
literally yesterday i walked in .
this store needs to get to it together .
and i wait _num_ minutes to find this out ?
ok i might be picky .
the next day no one could find it .
service is not good .
service here is awful .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
she refused to acknowledge that maybe she was wrong .
just insisted that i had said delmonico .
but i do n't recommend the place .
we were extremely disappointed .
the sauted mushrooms were particularly disappointing .
sorry , lone star .
steak was not cooked properly .
this review is from june _num_ , _num_ .
no salmon there when i went .
overpriced , mediocre food .
the baked potato should n't taste like that .
been here lots and this was n't the best .
not bad however , a bit over done .
the food and service were poor at best .
do n't waist your money on this place .
not good for vegetarians .
they actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips .
maybe it was just an off night for me .
not impressed at all .
i doubt i 'd go back there .
the layout of the establishment is also really weird .
we want spicy , cheesy goodness .
the rest of the meal is bland .
i wo n't go back .
please do n't waste your money .
this place was just okay for me .
no wonder they are about to lose their business .
this really turned my stomach .
visited the gilbert restaurant tonight at 7pm .
he never returned to me to check on us .
_num_ minutes later , our food was delivered .
walking in was not to expectations .
you want mexican , tons of other places .
skip this place , overpriced .
this place is a disgrace to mexican food .
today 's experience was awful !
we 're not dumb .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
do yourself a favor and skip this place .
there are a ton of awesome restaurants in phoenix .
the bad part was the food .
the worst part was the service .
i told her she was rude and disrespectful .
ok first off the decor made me feel dirty .
rice was very bland .
chips and salsa were ok .
it felt very _num_ inside .
my last visit was terrible .
served moldy tasting chips in a dirty bowl .
the beef enchilada had fatty pieces in it .
other than that nothing was worth eating .
this was no big deal to them .
i should 've taken the hint then .
there wo n't be a third .
burger was cooked properly but lean and dry .
just not great food .
my chicken was overcooked .
all in all , not a great experience .
bartender was rude as could be .
if only zero star was available .
i am allergic to diet soda .
i will spend my money elsewhere ... .
it just is n't worth it .
a very unimpressive meal today for breakfast .
and your employees are brain dead .
the worst best buy i 've ever been to .
worst best buy ever .
the manager of this store needs to be fired .
customer service here is terrible .
not worth the hassle to go here .
anyways , i do not like best buy .
mid day , mid week , store pretty empty .
they were just gone .
i could n't possibly stop them all .
excuse me , i have a return .
mgr : i 'm sorry .
we do not take returns over _num_ days .
this store however has been terrible .
not a big fan of best buy .
they are over priced and staff is not helpful .
today was sadly no different .
lo and behold they have _num_ in stock .
client service is awful .
purchased over _num_ laptop out of state .
i ca n't believe how dishonest this company is .
customer service is extremely lacking .
do not buy geek squad insurance .
it 's $ _num_ .
this _num_ star goes to geek squad .
they wo n't steer you in the wrong direction .
my phone was worthless .
worst customer service ever .
this location has terrible customer service .
shady business trying to get rid of old stock .
_num_ , i think .
the second one they installed had a bubble underneath .
try not to come here .
if i could give zero stars i would .
just do n't do it .
i wo n't be going back , thank goodness .
just poor customer service from this guy .
avoid them at all costs .
they are less expensive and so much better !
she was going to fix the problem right away .
man what a mess !
pretty disappointed will not be returning .
actually , no service at all .
very disappointed in my order .
the bill was $ _num_ .
i would not use them again .
they are not my first choice .
it 's just disappointing .
she does n't care about her customers .
when customer service is everything this store is nothing !
wish i would have gotten their names .
two is n't really that many !
the mattress is n't that great either !
very poor customer service .
what a complete and utter nightmare .
if i could give negative stars i would .
recently purchased a car here .
do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you .
words of advise ... stay away from these people .
this was n't his first time towing this vehicle .
i feel like i am being avoided .
how difficult could this to be to make .
the reason for the _num_ star rating ?
why ca n't they put up a barrier ?
not my favorite starbucks location .
nowhere near a grande .
the drive thru is a nightmare !
i do n't find that particularly appetizing .
i could n't taste the brie or the prosciutto .
i was very disappointed in the entire experience .
this place is subway quality for way more money .
avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians .
it was truly nasty .
there is no flow .
there was no trouble finding an empty table outside .
this was not an eight dollar sandwich .
i probably wo n't go back anytime soon .
- veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh .
ambiance a big zero .
on a busy sunday afternoon this is unacceptable .
sandwich just not good .
i tried the tuna on white rye .
but the flavors were just not there .
sandwiches were alright , but not worth the price .
unfortunately , it was quite dirty .
unsanitary , disorganized , and poor customer service .
this is not a high end shopping experience .
this is not a customer focused experience .
they often run out of merchandise .
it 's not worth it .
manager could n't help either .
so this was a bit of a turn off .
i was n't impressed with this place .
would n't recommend this place .
i 'd really second guess this daycare .
i dropped off a prescription tuesday evening .
one cashier and _num_ customers !
worst pharmacy service ever !
messed up my prescription several times this year already .
i need my medicine and nobody seems to care .
the store itself is alright .
the problem with this cvs is the pharmacy .
an hour later it was n't ready .
my doctor gave me this for a reason !
this is not okay !
prepare to be disappointed .
i kept smiling , but they just looked away .
my photo looks incredibly pissed off .
overall , annoying experience .
avoid if you can !
the minute clinic is awful .
incredibly rude and inconsiderate .
that 's not something we offer .
i called cvs to refill my own prescription .
she really ca n't see my prescription history ?
no apologies for the confusion , nothing .
the pharmacy gave me someone else 's prescription .
i 'll stick with the drive-thru from now on .
meanwhile it took _num_ minutes to get my appetizer .
the presentation was poor , and looked very unappetizing .
i wo n't be back .
the prices there are way too high .
had a terrible experience today .
she did n't care and it showed .
i 'll buy them elsewhere .
there were _num_ buffet items that were totally out .
no spice and no heat .
time has not been kind to flavors of india .
obviously , i 'm going to order the rice .
it just was n't particularly awesome or memorable .
i 'm not sure what it was .
dirty and full of roaches .
the rice was dry and crunchy .
the food was of poor quality .
the tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky .
on top of all that the services was horrid .
this was the worst experience ever in a restaurant !
finally , the cockroach fell onto our table .
is this the worst part of the visit ?
went to lunch buffet and it 's terrible .
the dishes taste nothing like they should .
not my choice for a lunch companion !
really pissed me off that she said that .
it is n't really a good value either .
this place is a run down dump .
the buffet is over priced .
the chicken curry was spicy but executed poorly .
if u want it eat otherwise u can leave .
there were a total of _num_ tables being occupied .
not happy with this restaurant at all .
looks like we are only indian here .
are you kidding me with this office staff ?
can i bill them for wasting my time ?
both were totally incompetent and uncaring .
i 'm only _num_ years old .
this was responsible for all of my pain !
both were totally incompetent and uncaring .
i 'm only _num_ years old .
this was responsible for all of my pain !
worst physician experience of my life .
-no one takes any personal responsibility .
did not get too far into the bs .
good doctors but a mess .
avoid it if at all possible .
wish i had never called them .
i strongly urge others to seek care elsewhere .
he missed the problem area due to poor testing .
oh , he missed my left arm all together .
worst customer service ever !
it 's been a mess .
i hope this saves someone from a mess .
then she was prescribed with pain meds .
then he walked out .
time to get a clue on customer service !
bad doctors , bad pt staff .
it was n't all bad .
and she repeated it .
i had the same experience as dana b below .
not on one occasion ... three .
_num_ ) number one and three .
_num_ ) number two and three .
_num_ ) all of the above .
alright , i 'm done .
do n't waste your time !
did n't seem to want to help me.
oh well ... there are other jewelers in town .
customer service was horrific !
the whole thing seemed so fishy .
worst experience ever , avoid this place !
i had already paid them the $ _num_ .
this is not what i wanted .
below is my outdated review .
i hate danny 's .
over $ _num_ for a crappy detail job .
that car washing cost me nearly $ _num_ .
but wait , there 's more .
ok , the owner must be a complete idiot .
everytime i go to this place i wonder why .
i was jammed up so she drove straight back .
the car is dirty and i 'm sad .
i did n't buy it .
dirty car even after most expensive carwash .
so i 'm going to try somewhere else .
bad wash as usual and no customer service .
convenient yes - but never going back !
do n't go to this joint .
no sir i just want my car washed .
the vip carwash includes washing the car , correct ?
today was ( again ) a poor experience .
the passenger seat is wet .
especially for _num_ dollars .
i am extremely unhappy .
bell road has the worst customer service ever .
this place is horrible .
so , so horrible .
its been impossible to get in all week .
i feel if your paying _num_ for detail .
do n't waste your time here for a detail .
this place dont know the meaning of that word .
car was n't clean .
( do they really vacuum ?
car was poorly cleaned and vacuum job was miserable .
i will never be going back .
this place is so slow .
i 'm not coming back here .
shame on me for going back .
not helping your cause dude .
it cost me $ _num_ to get it fixed .
i paid $ _num_ for a crappy car wash .
decent wash , sloppy dry .
the place made me feel uncomfortable .
i was so wrong .
i 'm highly disappointed .
next time i will go to los olivos .
stay away from these rip-off artist .
no hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said .
r u kidding me ?
lazy , unprofessional and downright rude .
why not put them in a dryer ?
again , this made no sense .
i could n't believe it .
too bad the management ca n't manage the staff .
so sad that management let it go !
the card racks are all empty .
even the fish tank looks awful .
my vip wash was not worth the money .
the entire visit was totally disappointing .
she shrugged it off .
the worst customer service you could ever imagine !
all i know is i will never be back .
the worst car wash in town .
please do not give them your business .
without fail , it is an unpleasant experience .
all bad , management needs to take notice .
horrible decline in quality of service .
this place is the worst .
the service has gotten worse .
i will not be going there ever again .
somebody is not telling me the truth .
next day visit lasted another _num_ hours !
this is where i almost lost it .
so i pay , no problem there .
i hate this place today .
it 's very slow so almost no staff .
most expensive car wash ever .
i filed a report with the police .
obviously , i will never be going back .
the manager did n't even seem surprised or apologetic .
if we could put _num_ stars we would .
this place is the worst .
today i visited and it was the worst !
seriously , you ca n't clean before you open ?
the car wash was mediocre at best .
its not worth the money and time .
not to mention my car still looked like shit .
if i could give negative stars i would .
whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself .
by far the worse place ever .
i was advised to contact corporate .
absolutely worst car wash !
people are very rude !
how bad could it be ?
they probably could have used three .
never more than _num_ min wait .
but today they lost my business !
i wo n't be back .
i still gave them a _num_ tip .
came in to get my newly painted car detailed .
no offer of compensation from danny 's .
i wo n't make that mistake again .
such a disappointing experience today !
he attempted to find them but to no avail .
and gave it another shot even worst .
i will not come here again .
$ _num_ for a basic car wash ?
ave car wash at best .
_num_ degrees and the misters do n't work ?
i have n't even seen my car yet .
poor ethics on their part .
* two pool tables .
and he 's particularly rude on the phone .
do n't waste your time at this store .
my advice is to avoid this store .
was not greeted or assisted when i came in .
the clerks who work here are very rude .
very poor customer service .
avoid this store at all cost .
this place is the worst .
sounded like it to me too originally .
i will not go back to this location .
stopped in to drop off an amazon return .
admittedly , like an idiot i just paid it .
he again denied me my refund and packages .
he refused to give them to me .
this is the exact opposite of customer service .
would give zero stars if i could .
this was my first visit to this specific location .
it deserves no stars !
the owner ( john ) , completely unprofessional .
fed ex all the way from now on .
wish i could give it zero stars .
( i ca n't stand that smell ) .
it 's just not worth it to me .
avoid this service shop .
i would stay far away from these guys .
their customer service is lacking .
they never once acknowledged me .
very very poor service .
i feel bad for whoever is paying them .
the sandwiches were ok , we ate them there .
i did n't feel comfortable to ask anymore questions .
worst service and pizza !
i did n't even get to tell them .
these were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce .
ca n't comment on the food .
a total cheers atmosphere for sure .
i used to love this place .
it all went down the past few weeks .
the food quality was lacking compared to their norm .
the biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty .
i wo n't be back .
i wo n't be coming back .
for two watered down drinks is a rip off !
mediocre , at best .
very disappointed in flavors in all but hamburger .
no recommendation on this place .
rude staff at bar .
the beer was flat .
this place is n't good .
i want to like this place .
this is a huge pet peeve for me .
this is just plain stupid .
unfortunately the fish was not edible , at all .
the melon salsa was horrid .
we walked in to a very dark bar .
the tuna was good but lacking some flavor .
to my surprise , some changes have been made .
it 's a shame really .
i think management just is n't paying attention .
we just wo n't be coming back .
this used to be one of my favorite places .
the other couple was already sitting !
worst experience i 've had in a long time .
what a disappointment , all around .
i do n't want to work that hard .
ca n't you just spell out the words ?
what was delivered was an unappetizing mess .
really it was a terrible presentation .
also , our waiter sucked !
we would have loved it rushed .
huh , how did he get that wrong ?
maybe i hit it on a bad night ?
okay food , terrible , slow and arrogant service .
dinner upstairs was a poor experience .
has rokerij lost it 's touch ?
worth the long wait to be seated .
i want to love this place so much .
but sadly i had a very disappointing experience there .
the atmosphere and wine did not disappoint .
ordered _num_ small plates .
overall , below average .
however , we left bitter and disappointed .
the bill came out to around _num_ dollars .
not worth the price or time .
anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters .
no one should come here and pay these prices .
ok no big deal .
so we left and went to capital grille instead .
no employees for _num_ minutes !
downstairs was too small .
too warm with the fireplace going .
no one wants a filet this way .
my duck was tough and fatty .
the wedge came out with no salad dressing .
the waitress insisted that it had dressing .
no offer for coffee and desert .
if i could give a zero i could .
waited _num_ minutes for a 7:30 reservation .
maybe this qualified for one star .
the hype is killing them .
cocktails were not up to par either .
nothing to do with smoke house cooking !
she was excited that this would be something special .
keep in mind i did not eat here .
so this post is not about food quality .
the food is good but service is horrible .
back ... i 'd spend your money elsewhere .
and this absolutely ruined the evening for me .
the guy bartender did not smile once .
the chicken schnitzel was fine .
the answering service promised an answer within _num_ hours .
_num_ hours later , no response .
no big deal right ?
all our glasses were empty most of the time .
food was just ok , not worth the cost .
we will not be going back .
officially not worth the the prices .
sadly the downstairs bar staff were amazingly bad .
incorrect drink refills , arrogant and incredibly slow service .
no big deal right ?
just being a fresh order ?
not particularly fond of .
mask one 's odor .
as to the preparation of the actual meat .
the philly pizza was sub par .
finally , _num_ minutes in , our food arrived .
i just had to try something different than dominos .
the sicilian here does n't really stand out .
meatballs were dry as shit and sliced .
overpriced , terrible service !
something different was off with each experience .
i visited nypd this past saturday .
this is probably the worst experience i have had .
you seriously disappointed me .
water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared .
the employees could care less if your there however .
they gave us a _num_ % discount .
it took _num_ hrs this time .
i did or said nothing wrong .
so we went from _num_ stars to _num_ .
not for the food .
we ordered lunch , and food was forgotten .
( chicken on a salad ) .
not true new york pizza .
the boneless wings we ordered were good at least .
wait , how did they even get seated ?
when i walked in they would n't seat me !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
sat for _num_ mins without any type of service .
zero menu , zero water and zero waitress .
would not be coming here ever again .
no additional veggies or croutons .
very , very average pizza .
most inefficient place i 've been at .
everyone was pissed off in the store .
you ca n't get simple service without waiting .
worst location i 've ever been .
i had brought the dog with me before .
really really poor customer service .
thank you verizon sales associate for wasting my time .
worst store i have been to .
jen did n't offer any of those options .
probably one of the worse stores in north phoenix .
do not do business with this ppl .
the customer service at this location is extremely lacking .
halloween , xmas crap !
failure , failure , failure .
not the greatest deal .
( its byob , $ _num_ corkage fee ) .
i 'm very disappointed in food network .
we could n't believe it .
on one hand , i 'm glad i did .
oh well , wine never really goes to waste .
bland , plain , flavorless pasta dishes .
wo n't be a repeat client .
did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?
a real disappointment overall .
this place was a huge disappointment .
i will not be going back .
the noodles were a little dry .
$ _num_ for this is also way to much .
i should have stuck with take out only !
prices are too high .
every time it has gotten worse .
in my opinion a stupid move .
the chairs were cheap plastic chairs .
this place is not even average .
i can not recommend this restaurant .
was so looking forward to it , sounded yummy .
she said no , and showed me a menu .
$ _num_ , for seven raviolis .
this place has nothing going !
did n't come close to our expectations .
bruschetta was served on garlic bread .
went here with _num_ other friends for dinner .
r u kidding me ?
dinner for _num_ of us was way overpriced .
only thing good was desert .
the owner thinks he 's a _num_ star chef .
plastic water cups with these prices ?
considering the prices , i expected more .
i do n't understand why anyone likes this place .
the food has no taste .
the wine list here is ridiculously expensive .
i did not want to pay more .
then the waiter took the bottle away .
it was a disappointing dinner .
i will not be back .
when i got home it was terrible .
i did n't even touch that dry mess .
i was pissed off .
so we eat it with disappointment .
i do n't know why this place is crowded .
the food is bland and it 's so tiny .
i tried a bit of parmesan , nope .
i will not be going back ... .
very , very disappointed .
i did n't eat mine .
did not come with salad , garlic bread .
review is not for the food .
the calamari had no flavor at all .
but overall a waste of money .
the staff said only seating outside for right now .
it was hot on the patio no misters .
not rushing to go there again !
not impressed , will not go back .
man was i wrong !
it did n't taste that good .
the size is a little more , too .
very tough and dry .
even baked ziti was just fair .
the eggplant parmigiana was heavy and not fresh .
a waste of $ _num_ .
i will not be returning .
the salad was fine but too much dressing .
we were sorely disappointed .
the food : mediocre would be a compliment .
the salad was lettuce carrots and oil .
they did not break out with new flavors .
very expensive , mediocre food , small portions .
l ordered the gnocchi with alfredo sauce .
i will not go there again .
i said no , and he brought someone over .
wo n't be going back .
left before we could try food .
unfortunately my dish was not good .
it was not worth the drive or the prices .
not worth it at all .
so why only _num_ stars ?
kind of sad to see .
this bar does not have anything going for it .
honestly , do n't waste your time .
the service is awful .
i hate the parking structure .
it 's just a mess .
costco pizza would have been better .
it was okay , nothing to write home about .
do n't even bother .
not one to waste liquor i finished it .
sorry i have not reviewed this joint sooner .
this burger was awful , maybe even freezer burnt .
this is bad eggs and really bad bacon !
they were barely warm !
$ _num_ house wines , and $ _num_ drafts .
their beans tasted so watered down .
wo n't be going back .
was terrible quality and not even what i ordered .
no way , this place needs to close immediately !
the service was good .
filibertos are individually owned and operated .
they were cold and soggy .
i doubt i will ever be back .
do n't rent unit _num_ .
your parking space is no where near the unit .
the hot water still takes forever to get hot .
not a very good place at all .
worst place i have ever lived .
no water half the time .
no a/c the other time .
i ca n't wait to move .
i would not recommend staying at the ritz .
so , no fresh towels the following day .
it once again smelled of cheap .
was not impressed with a upscale hotel .
very tired and in need of a makeover .
rooms are not nice .
old ... just did n't feel like a ritz .
there 's something very wrong with this .
overall the hotel itself is a little outdated .
the downside is that the walls are paper thin .
it 's dead we ca n't kill it .
do yourself a favor folks and stay elsewhere .
the pool does not include a hot tub .
the restaurants are boring .
this ritz is disgusting .
it could barely pass as a marriott .
the whole time we got no service !
need to improve their restaurant reservation process .
around _num_ i started seeing dr. price .
there was no root canal needed .
i have had a horrible experience here .
but this is n't the worst part yet ... .
we ordered apps , salads , wine and entrees .
however , it took another _num_ mins .
, while the mac needed more cooking time .
even the replacement was n't any good .
they seriously need some customer service skills .
no , more like convenience for her .
um , excuse me ?
even worst , it did n't arrive until 9pm .
do not use this company to transfer title .
stay away , stay far away from this company .
do not use these people .
they are incompetent and useless .
the food was n't spectacular .
apparently , its not so good there .
nope , typical golf club restaurant .
only the valet was worthwhile .
do not waste your money on this place .
our client got a turkey sandwich .
nothing to rave about .
it taste like pure mayonnaise on my salad .
first off the hall carpets are dirty .
the room was average but smelled musty .
i would not waste my time staying here .
please tell me the owners are not really greek .
the pork and chicken were pretty disgusting .
both pork and chicken were dry .
that would put you out of business in chicago .
stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy .
come steve better gyros for all is needed .
she 's not here . ''
it was truly insane behavior .
obviously , i 'm never going back .
so i left another note for sarah .
she then threatened me with her lawyer .
worse part about it was the managers rude reaction .
never been here before .
girls ' night out .
not sure i will be back .
less drinks , same price !
the most amazingly bad service i 've ever received .
do n't let this place fool you .
btw def did n't taste like a merlot .
she does n't deserve it !
spoke with another manager , francisco .
anyway he said adam will call me back .
i am not making this up .
i did n't like that one bit .
i was n't blown away by the choices .
also the ambience was nothing special .
not the elegant classic bar i was expecting .
the bartender was awesome .
just bad service lol .
the customer service was also very lack luster .
the pasta 's were just boring .
twice , they turned it off without coming in .
no one explained to me what was going on .
my advice , walk across the street to starbucks .
and wipe down the counter .
i agree with jake ... mediocre at best ... .
i just do n't get it .
she said she could not do that .
that cpk allowed substitutions ?
yep , i might tell other people .
she was too busy trying to look pretty .
cali ca n't do pizza !
why does this place still exist ?
it 's not the answer to any current question .
the pizza is never better than so-so .
the service tends to be a bit slow .
there are tables jammed into every possible space .
this service is too inconsistent .
does n't rate even one star .
glad it did n't make it in tucson .
the next booth was n't quite as bad .
there again was that horrible spoiled dirty smell .
so needless to say i was very disappointed .
do n't think i could go there again .
i showed up about _num_ minutes before my appt .
there was nothing warm about it .
this pedicure is a basic one , nothing special .
she is incredibly rude .
i did not like the pedicure chairs at all .
they obviously do n't care much about their customers .
there was no attention to my body 's needs .
i 'm really disappointed .
i will never step foot in that place again .
when it did arrive i was unfortunately , disappointed .
unfortunately , we probably wo n't be back .
another _num_ for our food .
this did not wow me at all .
like the steak was gold on the inside .
our entrees were salmon and new york steak .
the mashed potatoes were dried out and crusty .
i did not even get a water glass !
never got drink or a sorry .
avoid , it is going down hill quickly .
this place is not safe to live in .
the staff is rude and unprofessional .
they will not help you at all .
avoid at all costs !
this is typical of the place .
that 's not saying much is it .
do n't go to this location .
they do n't follow the parent company 's lead .
a depressing waste of _num_ dollars .
there was no one around to help .
the dryers are _num_ cents for _num_ minutes .
yeah , this is before i started eating clean .
anyway , i had some questions .
just left this place laughing my ass off !
no big deal right ?
he told me yea they do n't carry it .
he looked it up and still nothing .
a full _num_ second stare .
you did n't even walk out till after 8:00 .
you did n't even walk out till after 8:00 .
did n't you just eat out ? ''
foul , foul , foul .
the child menu is short and fare priced .
i 've given you plenty of chances , mile .
for $ _num_ bucks really , .
alas , that was not to be .
it 's also not particularly cheap .
my prison plate was $ _num_ with the tax .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
i do n't get it .
the food was cold including the soup , fries .
the brisket was dry and the service was awful .
the ruben was awful .
ok , no problem .
within _num_ minutes , the corned beef arrived .
it 's a sad weird place frozen in time .
avoid at all costs .
plain sandwiches and too high a price .
the portions are big , that is correct .
wo n't go back .
this time was no different .
anything other than lunch is overpriced .
but last two times the service was terrible .
it was packed on a thursday night .
everything on the menu is sooo expensive .
it was n't very good at all .
this location is a hot mess .
im asian i eat rice almost everyday .
i wo n't be back to this location .
we stayed though because we are not rude .
$ _num_ per slice for a cheesecake ?
this location , however , is my least favorite .
nope you 're wrong not with elizabeth .
very disappointed and wo n't return to this location !
however , when it arrived i was very disappointed .
$ _num_ for a _num_ minute lunch !
my beef with this chain is their portion sizes .
the service there is atrocious !
will not spend another dime at this establishment !
wait is longer than indicated - no reservations .
hosts do not acknowledge or update you .
they do not take reservations .
there were _num_ servers for our group .
no crunch , no color , no like .
the food was nothing to write home about either .
how rude , i thought .
there was no sense talking to them .
i drank water since i had lost my appetite .
one one occasion i ordered the chicken piccata .
sorry cheesecake factory , you had your three strikes !
this place was no where near busy .
it was very hard to eat .
the bathroom was very messy .
paper towels were everywhere .
my mom was very disappointed .
tired of my vanilla stylist , i went here .
i still hate it and i am still furious .
busy is one thing , cold is another .
she had no other work experience posted . )
i 'm _num_ yrs .
i ignored my gut and scheduled .
my answer was a very clear `` no '' .
it just was not good .
it was not a `` style '' .
umm ... no thanks !
fancy spa this place definitely is not !
probably wo n't be going back .
anyway , my haircut was terrible .
my hair is a bit past below my breasts .
expected yes , impossible to correct , no .
silly me , i should of known better .
grand total $ _num_ .
this is my worst experience i 've ever had .
i would n't give them even _num_ star .
and started do even worse .
this place is gross .
service was good but my account was overcharged .
if i could give zero stars i would !
but instead it went back on the shelf .
this is the worst manicure i 've ever gotten .
i want my money back .
do not go to this salon !
do n't waste your money and go somewhere else .
and this bread was not it .
no french bakery feel at all .
this place is horrible .
pricey and bad service .
also , there pastry selection is always inconsistent .
they are ok , but not anything special .
so not worth it .
do not drive to this place .
also , waste of groupon money !
the bad reviews below are all accurate .
beware being ripped off at au petit four !
so we all walked to the dessert case .
i feel a little ripped off .
how _num_ faced can you get .
au petit four a disappointment to say the least .
i doubt very much if they even sold those .
worst brunch i ever had !
pastries arrived quickly but no coffee .
will not go there ever again !
the place itself has a very odd smell inside .
the place has a stink of a sewer .
sad cause i could have actually liked this place .
these people are horrible and rude .
do n't waste your money at this place .
$ _num_ for two very gross pastries .
i am disappointed in this place .
i prefer a sprouts , safeway , or frys .
for starters , i find thier food selection odd .
then , they stopped making it .
what a really terrible experience .
he did n't apologize .
he did n't go check .
holy crap ... really ?
no friendly faces there anymore .
they just were not made with love .
never going back even if they paid me too !
i paid $ _num_ for horrible set !
i am very unhappy and will never go back !
i experienced very slow service for ritz standards .
when the food came i realized why .
do you valet more often than not ?
they just are n't supposed to be chewy .
the side dishes were mediocre .
again , steak is not supposed to be chewy .
it also had very little flavor itself .
bad food and terrible service .
do n't do it , try city hall .
dessert was unimpressive as well and really uninspired .
needles to say i will not be returning .
the caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo .
the mashed potatoes were lumpy .
horrible food , my third visit and extremely over-priced .
the steak that is almost tasteless .
veggies that are plain but buttery .
first of all the service was absolutely horrible .
very bad service overall .
the dining experience was terrible !
we had dinner there tonight .
the potatoes were bland and unimpressive .
for these prices expected a lot better experience .
and the steaks were overcooked as well !
no one could finish their steaks either .
tough , get used to it .
we will not be back !
cheaper , better tasting and larger portions .
unfortunately the chips are soggy after _num_ minute .
there 's your bad .
ordered _num_ quesadilla and _num_ rolled tacos .
first off she tried to add extra beans .
they are awful do n't go there .
what a huge disappointment .
dressing was over spiced , just burned .
i probably wo n't go back .
had the vegetarian appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
restaurants run out of things .
probably $ _num_ worth of chicken .
salad was decent , but just a greek salad .
should have sent them back but did n't .
damage , $ _num_ bill plus tax and gratuity .
myself , i doubt i 'll be back .
just too many amazing dining opportunities in phoenix .
it says you 're open until _num_ on sunday .
worst service i 've ever experienced .
staff is incompetent and rude .
we will not be back .
i was very sadly disappointed .
greek salad tasted like nothing .
calamari fried in old oil as well .
gyro sandwich was bland too .
very , very disappointing .
it was a disaster .
six months later , i am still disgusted .
i wo n't eat scallops .
six months later , i am still disgusted .
i wo n't eat scallops .
the halibut oscar did not have much flavor .
one of our friends actually sent hers back .
now i am not a big eater .
it was pretty pitiful .
but i would not return for the brunch .
the chips were rubber and dripping with oil .
the taste of the oil was disgusting .
this is where the bad experiences started .
fine , no big deal .
$ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ meal !
strikes # _num_ , _num_ , and _num_ .
anyway , staff , what staff ?
( the really short _num_ 's looking guy ) .
that unfortunately includes the clothing side .
ive been to better consignment places .
new location needs better ventilation .
awkward layout reeks of musty clothes .
they pay _num_ % and shipping .
i found my sisters closet was very dishonest .
their advertising is very misleading .
i am not returning ever again .
only _num_ beers on tap .
did n't see a thing wrong with it .
thought i would give them another chance .
no attempt to offer a discount or anything .
not at all the case .
sorry , but not impressed .
do n't buy deals for this business .
this business closed in early november with no notice .
service can be slow .
this place screams style over substance .
service and long waits are to be expected here .
maybe , if it was _num_ .
zen _num_ is terrible .
sushi was ok for phoenix standard .
there are other places that serve better sushi .
to make it worse , service was ridiculously lackluster .
after much aggravation , the manager removed the charge .
the floating flies were not the worst part .
conclusion , go to zen _num_ for the ambiance .
not the food or drinks .
then it got worse everytime i came there .
it was the opposite of fresh .
too bad , really .
the chefs could n't even see their hands .
if you fail rice , you fail sushi .
also , the place is crowded .
not in a good , social lounge scene way .
seriously , it 's not that chic .
could n't she have told us that first ?
even the temperature of the food was n't right .
( it was n't very warm out there ! )
boy was that a mistake .
they 're seriously no bigger than quarters .
pathetic sushi , really .
they have a very limited beer selection as well .
the server was also very clueless .
there 's no other way to say it .
and , their happy hour is totally weak .
zen _num_ is n't one of them .
not good , not bad , just okay .
i would never return to this place .
food is mediocre at best .
it 's that bad .
giving up does n't seem fit .
garbage seriously tastes better then anything at this location .
i have lost all faith in taco bell .
not really sure what went wrong .
blah , worst coffee ever .
a waste of my time .
nope ... no big deal .
she said sure , no problem .
oh , but wait !
there just is n't any room .
ai n't no one got time for that .
i could not taste coffee .
no offer of anything else , no suggestions .
just the attitude get going and get of here .
not sure how , or why .
soup 's not the same .
first bite was disgusting .
could n't bring myself to finish lunch .
now the negatives ... the cashew chicken was flavorless .
we had lunch today .
beef and broccoli was salty .
the meats did not seem fresh .
the moo goo gai pan was very salty .
so we had bloody marys instead .
for $ _num_ , that 's ridiculous .
bland , boring and old !
get new recipes and better cooks .
bland , uninspired , boring and dark .
do n't miss spicy mary .
do n't miss it .
is southern cooking just not interesting ?
how can a cajun restaurant get this wrong ?
the chicken was placed on bread that was hard .
the fries were cold .
our last visit was n't the greatest .
microwaved etouffee just is n't right .
that should be your clue .
regardless , i am only giving this _num_ stars .
it was not good at all .
i went there for lunch with my boyfriend .
it was pretty disappointing .
nothing to rave about this place .
service was poor and the food was bad .
the service was horrible .
my gumbo was cold and really bland .
it was really dry and flavorless .
overall , bad service and bland food .
it was not worth the time or money .
we were greatly disappointed .
last but not least , the gravy .
this meal was not worth $ _num_ .
i can not recommend baby kay 's .
my review is already biased from the start .
pricey for mediocre food and service .
would not recommend this place .
the food was mediocre .
also , the rice was overcooked and mushy .
the seafood gumbo was just meh .
it was just a thin soup .
not the correct texture or flavor .
these shrimp lacked seasoning .
and this time the flavor was just totally lacking .
it was more like salt shrimp .
or soggy ass salt shrimp .
no awesome blossom here folks .
not much joy in this club .
i was n't given a choice .
why not offer to fix it ?
no questions , no apologies , no explanation .
can i give these company a worse score ?
i am not the only person this happened to .
mike just basically blew me off .
worst haircut i have ever had !
that is how bad she left it .
this is the worst haircut ever !
but i was wrong .
so i am stuck .
which is why i am warning others .
i refuse to go back .
i really do not see why .
i wish i had gone elsewhere .
this was not the case .
it just made no sense at all .
i have never been denied service on purpose .
i have never been treated so rude .
do not give this store your business .
i would never hire this company again .
is it possible to give `` zero '' stars ?
i 'm a paying customer too .
staff is mostly disinterested , but some are helpful .
and i will advise everyone to avoid this place .
the manager still has not called me back .
the boots were sold as new , on clearance .
what 's wrong with this place , then ?
bottom line really bad bad customer service .
stayed _num_ nights for spring training .
gym is small and outdated .
extremely dissappointed i must say !
this hotel is very disappointing .
checking in was a breeze .
an old hotel stench .
bathroom was very slow .
other than that , i 've experienced better .
such an outdated hotel i 'm totally disappointed .
every entrance to every room faces the interior courtyard .
its just a bizarre set up for a hotel .
the bathroom makes no sense .
also rooms have a terrible old musty smell .
carpet in lobby and hallways filthy !
seven day stay between christmas and new year .
birds in the atrium while food was being served .
a dog was led through the atrium during breakfast .
but dirty silverware was the final straw for me .
_num_ ) no ac .
_num_ ) absolutely and completely filthy .
_num_ ) elevators are unbelievably slow .
overall : not so good .
was sent _num_ miles away .
replacement hotel was not good either .
do not trust this property .
the hotel itself is filthy .
its _num_ degrees outside !
boy was this the worst mistake i ever made .
it was shocking and frankly , insulting .
it 's really a shame .
i suspect a bad cut of beef .
when it arrived , it was clearly not medium .
more like a ton of disappointment .
that was n't mentioned anywhere .
drinks were small , weak and overpriced .
total waste of time and money .
the carpaccio was the worst i have ever tasted .
and worse , it tasted like it .
there is no longer a $ _num_ buffet .
but they were not prepared .
the service was very poor .
it 's likely i wo n't be back .
and the salmon was too salty even for me .
the food was horrible !
the server was the worst i have ever seen .
it was unbelievably bad .
the food was below average relative to the prices .
we were disappointed and embarrassed by several things .
once we were seated it went downhill .
the manager shrugged and walked away .
one can be in error on this too .
we were so disappointed !
very , very poor .
first course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto .
the fish over couscous was cooked well .
the espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee .
i consider this deal a rip off .
i am unsure why .
the restaurant was not full .
the views , outside , were fantastic .
a top , and , it is high .
handicapped , it is really dangerous .
they have taken away several of the better offerings .
no real substance to anything food wise .
it was a very limited menu and small portions .
but the food was poor at best .
we will not be going back !
he also said the carpaccio was n't very good .
the highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese .
the meal cost $ _num_ per person .
visited for az restaurant week .
our server was curt and mostly ignored us .
waited far too long for the check .
flourless chocolate cake was dry .
plus $ _num_ fee for valet ?
far nicer restaurants in phoenix offer valet for free .
this place is not worth the time or money .
wo n't be returning or referring .
the food however was a desperate cry for help .
however , do n't go for happy hour .
the hr food was horrendous and all fried carbs .
it just got worse from there .
skip this place and spend your money elsewhere .
be weary of this groomer .
very bad experience trying to board my dog .
what a huge waste of time and frustration !
slow as hell and no customer service .
just threw it all in the trash .
a waste _num_ $ .
she could not get the order straight .
not a good first impression .
this was n't some `` maybe '' food poisoning .
this location needs to get it 's sh*t together .
just go to a different location .
very unprofessional and rude .
he came & fixed my problem quickly .
no fix , no refund , no nothing .
ca n't see myself ever coming back .
what a waste of a trip .
they took _num_ minutes at the window .
said they could n't give us a receipt .
our food was cold .
such a terrible experience .
i gave my dog ( really ?
no , they must have them done again .
i have no reason not to .
i did not receive a call back at all .
shop elsewhere to avoid the wait .
will not be visiting this clinic again .
i truly hate this vet office .
worst apartment complex in the history of the world .
and they refuse to fix it !
staff is completely useless .
run run run away .
what the hell is this place ?
my recommendation , do n't bother .
however , i had really a really poor experience .
not a very professional response .
slow service and they were empty .
we spent our _num_ at a different restaurant .
the food is just ok nothing special .
the service is just ok too .
i would n't go here expecting too much .
the food was really bad .
will not go back .
very empty at dinner time on a thursday .
no soup for you !
that is a direct quote .
the gm is n't friendly and could careless .
you can tell the staff is n't well trained .
not sure if we would try this place again .
but the rating goes mainly for the staff .
worst mexican food chain ever !
well , the steak fajita nachos were ok too .
it was really empty when we were there .
but recent experience not so great .
there really was no other option . ''
not your best , saks .
horrible quality and costumer service .
this is where it goes weird .
obviously missed my joke .
she is still confused ... .
worst possible customer service experience at lv .
do not waste your time .
disappointed in their shoe return policy .
i will not shop for shoes there again .
snooty vibe , unwelcoming pretentious people .
i would recommend shopping around for better customer service .
pretty poor customer service in my opinion .
turns out i was wrong .
_num_ days later and i feel exactly the same .
are you kidding me ?
his staff is extremely poorly managed .
steak is probably better in the desert .
played my _num_ holes and got out !
they cant tell me anything til monday !
i do n't understand all the good reviews .
we shared the caprese appetizer .
for lunch i had the pasta trio .
i wo n't be going back .
the experience did not improve my initial opinion .
wo n't be trying this restaurant again .
negatives were the entrees .
i had n't eaten here in years .
nothing has changed it 's dark and outdated .
the veal was rubbery and the breading soggy .
the tiramisu was soggy as well .
the cake at the bottom was soaking wet .
the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor .
this risotto was a disaster !
my friends vegetables were mush .
it was worse than the first visit .
the food itself was pretty bad .
we were given _num_ dinner menus for _num_ people .
and do n't get me started on the decor .
will not go back again .
she did not seem to enjoy this very much .
the vegetables were mush and again just luke warm .
however the food was horrible .
completely outdated overpriced food .
coming here was not my idea .
did i mention the over-priced , watered down drinks ?
it was all poor quality food and poorly prepared .
it tasted at least _num_ days old .
the shrimp cocktail was large , cold and fresh .
i had the pasta trio .
there were _num_ of us dining .
wo n't do it again .
, mushy , and tasted several days old .
order taken , maybe slightly rushed .
then service fell apart .
we ordered tiramisu , absolutely disgusting .
mushy and in a gooey tasteless white sauce .
the flavors were very blah .
just a bunch of mush .
i will never dine here again .
_num_ bucks a plate .
more like an american italian food .
the best part is the tacky 80s decor !
it 's not authentic italian .
the pasta was not served al dente .
it is terribly ugly !
so do n't go here expecting a good view .
the whole thing was bad .
my date got spaghetti which was n't anything special .
i 'd never go back .
if i could give a negative star i would .
shoddy work , inept & rude .
otherwise it would have been _num_ .
also missing was a jalapeo pepper .
no worries , just a mile down the street .
we were ignored for most of our short visit .
we were n't really greeted .
there was literally no one else in the store .
she said she did n't have either .
i was really disappointed .
nothing too fancy , but certainly well-maintained and clean .
not $ _num_ for the first session .
i literally hated this place .
this place is dated .
i roll in and it 's not done !
i wish i had looked at yelp prior .
wo n't make that mistake again .
this is sick and made me lose my appetite .
this place lost a good waitress when laura left .
sorry jerry 's restaurant but your food is terrible .
i will not be returning .
this was an awful experience !
let 's just say do n't waste your time .
the only cook was n't talking to her .
thankfully the meal was pretty cheap .
i ordered the hot turkey sandwich .
however , the service sucked !
the service is appalling .
maybe then people will want to come back .
there were just two servers on for the place .
service was slow to say the least .
the potatoes and toast were pretty standard issue stuff .
this was pretty much the worst dining experience ever .
unfortunately she only works certain days .
that is a big no no for me .
we just left the restaurant .
there are good greasy spoon restaurants and bad ones .
it was tasteless and cold .
chicken fried steak was frozen great .
the herbs did nothing for the dish .
the bartender , brian , was very attentive .
just ok for lots of money .
overpriced and not the best phoenix has to offer .
unfortunately , i did not have a good experience .
wo n't be back .
i wo n't be going back there ever again .
you fooled me once linda .
they do n't seem to care about our business .
the employees here need some serious training .
i had a terrible experience here .
$ _num_ for every little sewing job .
i ca n't stand sprint .
the insurance only covers a direct replacement .
so why _num_ stars ?
no problems at all .
and just all around poor customer service .
yeah , no thanks .
worst customer service because i have no answers .
i 've since discovered they are worse .
are you kidding me ?
wow was i wrong .
this is by far the worst sprint store !
do not use this store .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
everytime im in here staff is extremely rude .
do n't use sprint !
i seriously hate this store .
my phone is broken and ca n't turn on !
do n't waste your time here !
the prices are reasonable but the choices are slim .
there was no apology or explanation given .
i do n't recommend this business .
they just seemed clueless about my car .
they can no longer be treated with antibiotics .
so a total of _num_ teeth .
condescending and arrogant does n't even describe it .
_num_ 's this place was the best club around .
now it 's the worst .
just was n't couple friendly at all .
throwing money out on stage was just a waste .
was not even offered lap dances .
so it is very easy to get to .
do n't even bother going here now .
do n't waste your money here .
we paid _num_ dollars for nothing but disappointment .
ca n't quite figure that one out .
never had anything like this before .
i said no to give us a few minutes .
unfortunately , they missed the mark , badly .
the chicken was equally lacking .
fail , fail and fail .
have n't been to the restaurant in ten years .
the food had too much msg .
our food was worse !
the chicken wings gave me food poisoning .
will avoid in the future .
got my money but not my order .
i was hoping it was a one time thing .
so lazy employees decide to take off early .
this way , they might get something right .
after _num_ minutes , still no food .
it just tasted funky .
overall , just overpriced and not that great .
the pizza was ok but the service was terrible .
what a waste of time and money .
it was just `` eh '' .
too bad , was a pretty good pie .
the delivery was not good .
worst pizza place ever .
i wish there was an option for zero stars !
they were extremely rude and not helpful at all !
do n't use their service .
no dirt ) for my new tenant .
do not buy this groupon !
they showed up late and made me wait .
there van broke down in my driveway .
i have already emailed groupon to get a refund .
i wish i could give this _num_ stars .
no apology given for being _num_ hours late .
then he hung up on me .
but on the very bottom shelf .
i could n't understand the lady , either .
this manager was seriously trying to cover her butt .
this place is absolutely the worst .
horrible customer service and poor workmanship !
this is not your typical embassy suites .
that turned out to be the problem .
_num_ ) $ _num_ / day parking fee .
it was about _num_ minutes , no joke .
rooms would not even get cool .
will not be staying there again .
it is not your average embassy suites .
they should really make this a motel _num_ .
this place is really old and dated .
the free breakfast is not worth it .
very much in need of a complete overhaul .
would not recommend this for a long stay .
i booked a suite ( not jr suite ) .
the girl was so rude !
i was not pleased .
probably wo n't be back .
not going back again until they remodel their looks .
this embassy suites is ok .
did n't like this place .
the room was dated but clean .
wo n't be back .
this place is n't all that well kept .
for me it was a company meeting .
the heating did n't work .
still no heat in our room after two nights .
third night we demanded another room .
the interior is outdated .
that did n't really start things off well .
so shoes had to be worn inside the room .
not bad of a hotel location , great breakfast .
next , i went to get my complimentary breakfast .
how dirty , disgusting , and rude !
i had a horrible stay !
not of embassy quality - very poor property .
old and run down .
i opened closet door and it smelled of sewer .
no restaurants within walking distance .
there is nothing very nice about this properly .
in phoenix it was _num_ last week .
this place is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
i have stayed in another hilton property in az .
the rooms , grounds are extremely dated .
as though i 'm an inconvenience .
in short , go elsewhere .
the quality is not what it used to be .
then why say it ? ''
all of can say is they are rude !
yes , she did let me return them .
lost a large sale today , again .
this is disappointing to me .
it 's small crowded and hard to navigate .
this time was different , though .
i do n't get it .
i was responsible and i knew it .
it was less than _num_ hours later .
it was and is not a good business practice .
i will not be shopping there again .
this has been a huge mess .
was told everything had been sold .
_num_ ) called the store again .
_num_ ) several weeks have passed .
but then their quality really sucked .
so i did the repair myself .
i do n't want to take away from that .
this is update to review submitted in _num_ .
in a word , greedy .
no one at best western will refund my money .
they have not returned my phone calls or emails .
i do not recommend working here .
i 'm not a happy customer .
i am really sad .
he totally ignored me and started helping another customer .
overall , a very disappointing adventure .
unfortunately - worst customer service in the world .
it 's a shame .
no apologies for the mistakes both times .
customer service was terrible .
poor performance and total confusion at the shop .
the decorations were very plain , underwhelming .
i am so disappointed in this place .
i would barely even give this place _num_ star .
that is too expensive for a simple oil change .
i wo n't be back .
stay away from this creepy out of control business .
like novelty t-shirts and stripper gear .
they have very limited inventory .
i 'm not on the walking dead here .
this is the worst company to deal with .
i mean , this is a health issue .
she never followed up to find out .
no fancy card for me .
is everything frozen and reheated ?
no beans , just rice please .
wrong answer , jesus .
this was a huge disappointment .
i will say the cheese crisp was pretty disappointing .
salsa is n't spicy anymore .
this place is very overrated .
do n't waste a cent at this place .
this manuel 's falls short of the other .
very disappointed in this place .
only positive thing about this place was the margaritas .
the manager barely helped .
sales folks are pushy and not helpful .
had not been wiped down at all .
find a better car wash !
poor quality of service and product .
i would not recommend to anyone !
i would never recommend this car wash to anyone .
charge me for it ?
this was my first time visiting this car wash .
biggest mistake was not watching them vacuum and wax .
very bad experience here .
it cost $ _num_ to replace .
longest and worst wax job i ever had !
no stars for this place.
i also go hung up on .
i usually just get a carwash .
told me it would take about _num_ minutes .
unfortunately i will not be back because of tony !
very unhappy with the service i received here .
needless to say i will not be back .
this place was a complete let down .
not worth my time or money .
i will not let this go lightly .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
worst customer service experience of my life .
i 've had several disappointing experiences here .
sadly , i get the opposite here .
the purse was only a month old .
i walked in ready to buy .
horrible customer service and indifferent sales associates .
the customer service is horrible .
rude employees , avoid the store like the plague !
wow was the customer service horrible .
like , within ten minutes of leaving this place .
simply because i 've never been so sick .
eh , i 'm torn .
ruth chris did not meet my expectations .
no complaints about the service or the atmosphere .
i 'll never visit a ruth 's chris again !
are you kidding me ?
that is not an entre !
it was n't juicy enough or moist .
_num_ star - not going back !
ok , i just do not get this place .
can we say very limited menu ?
she barely even knew what the daily specials were !
her attitude was unacceptable .
it took another _num_ minutes to get our change .
customer service was terrible so i left .
long and short of it .
the hawaiian rib-eye was however tough .
took over _num_ minutes to get it cleared up .
a small quality step down from across the street .
my water glass was empty almost half the evening .
that ran out too , and sat for ages .
houston 's was too good not to .
never have to worry .
are we that pretentious hillstone ?
it does n't go anywhere .
i will focus on my biggest disappointment .
the entrance is nearly impossible to find .
wo n't be back there any time soon .
ca n't say no to mom , right ?
$ _num_ for a side salad .
i wo n't be back .
i wish hillstone would get it .
such potential - such a disappointment .
the food was not that good .
it was just awful !
the spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy .
try the capital grille right down the road .
i 've never had a bad experience there .
i was probably shooting a little high .
i will definitely not be back to the restaurant .
not such a great place .
just awful ; service food ... the whole thing .
food was cold and poor quality .
service , they just did n't care .
this was just flat out rude and very disappointing .
not sure we will go back .
we sure miss houston 's in the biltmore .
not the same in volume nor flavor .
c'mon hillstone ... step up !
i will not be back to try anything else .
try another restaurant in the area .
i was terribly upset with this restaurant .
they refused saying it does n't look as good .
cold night in phoenix .
it 's not a fire or safety risk .
... out of prime rib .
the worst service i have had .
the mojito was horrible , we never got greeted .
two drinks , and two sandwiches for lunch .
$ _num_ plus dollars .
my date , a glass of chardonnay .
me , the veggie burger with kale salad .
it was ok but very messy and nothing special .
okay this pissed me off !
it 's season _num_ with attitude .
nothing new or original on the menu .
he sat down with us in the booth .
unpleasant experience when you spend $ _num_ on dinner .
i most likely wo n't be back .
i will not return for a second visit .
no communication skills at all .
this store is too busy .
the experience itself was more than frustrating .
so i repeat why i am returning it .
so no more lines at the front .
i hate all apple stores .
this was a bit disappointing .
you really left me no choice .
they really did n't care about serving their customers .
they were very helpful .
i will avoid these stores like the plague .
but they do n't care !
could use some training in customer service .
being rude definitely runs in the store .
not enough personnel to support the customer .
appointments do n't mean nothing here .
personnel hygiene is non existent for the apple employees .
talked to me like i was just an idiot .
worst experience i 've ever had .
worst customer care ever !
zero customer service , rude , very unhelpful service .
apple 's `` service '' is abysmal .
he was very unprofessional .
the staff were a little rude and arrogant .
worst customer service experience ever .
the worst customer service available .
just completely horrible service .
all they wanted was more freaking money
beyond disappointed in this apple store .
this location is terrible .
you 've been warned !
obviously they did not do the work at all .
but it obviously did not work .
overpriced and lost my trust right away .
meaning we are paying for the services .
i would not recommend their service to anyone .
after all , the overhead lights hurt my eyes .
avoid this pharmacy like the plague .
yes they honored my warranty on my car battery .
it took less than _num_ minutes to find everything .
then i 'll asked him to check the fluids .
morning crew not helpful .
the cocktail waiter offered no wine suggestions .
we were extremely disappointed .
still , i wo n't be going back .
no wonder there was valet out front !
this meal was a disaster !
terrible service ... totally non existent service .
food incredibly lacking in flavor .
pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce .
he was n't part of the entertainment .
will never waste money there again .
nothing to look at on outside .
valet charges $ _num_ ... okay .
tables were not exceptionally comfortable , were close together .
wait staff was just okay .
not formal enough , nor timely .
not unfriendly , but not friendly either really .
my bill was $ _num_ before tip .
i surely wo n't be back .
does n't look good .
we sampled the duck tamales .
unfortunately , there was nothing special about this dish .
no second chances for this place - no thanks !
overall , it is not on my return list .
really needs attention from its chef owner .
the salmon quesadilla was much better .
the portion sizes of these plates were underwhelming .
they do n't tolerate menu questions for special events .
it appears mr. vincent takes the cheap way out !
their wine list was extensive but grossly over priced .
terrible service , nobody managing what is going on .
_num_ more minutes passed slowly by .
no we will not be returning .
we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine .
i have never seen this at any restaurant before .
first off , i 've been here before .
this time could not have been more opposite .
then _num_ minutes later came our cheese plate .
it 's too bad .
the bacon was okay but definitely reheated .
are you kidding me ?
but not the coffee lady !
my coffee was weak .
searching for a new primary care physician is difficult .
so embarrassing , especially when your sick .
the long waits where always enjoyable .
this place is awful .
prescription refills are slow .
the waiting room was nearly empty .
no wait , office staff was friendly .
i hate this place .
some equipment just goes missing , too .
i feel like i 've entered an 80s gym !
that whole ordeal lasted a few weeks .
the only positive is the classes .
as far as price goes , no complaints .
the gym in general does not feel clean .
this place could not be more poorly run .
can i give it no stars ?
cardio equipment is old and usually broken .
really , it is gross and broken down .
there is always broken equipment .
old equipment that is usually broken .
the place is very dirty and smelly .
the ac never seems to be working .
i 'm considering driving to _num_ ave and bell .
maintenance is clearly not a priority .
this place is falling apart .
the steam room smells like piss .
for shame _num_ hour fitness .
this is the worst location in the valley .
this place is a dump .
i used just one session .
and they refused to give me any money back .
hated losing that four hundred dollars .
they are unorganized and not very customer friendly .
tell your friends to avoid them too .
no towels provided in the gym .
cheap , but dirty .
there machine has been broken since october .
it 's extremely disappointing , to say the least .
no customer service whatsoever .
i guess standards for hiring have gone way downhill .
i wasted an hour of my day .
customer service here leaves a lot to be desired .
oh , sorry , that would make sense ... .
probably the worst paint department you can imagine .
so no one to help the customer right ?
this home depot poor service .
again , another long wait .
it was a nightmare .
super busy , all of the time .
this place is awful .
but their answers are mostly soooo lame !
as of november _num_ , this place changed hands .
overall , i do recommend ice house tavern .
you dont even have to travel to california .
it 's hard to get too mad though .
in fact , it fell quite short .
almost smelled fishy to me .
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible .
restaurant itself feels like a converted fast-food joint .
i did n't hate it , it was okay .
the service is super slow .
then about _num_ minutes after that we ordered .
i have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings .
if you go , do not expect great service .
the atmosphere is weird !
unfortunately , i was disappointed with everything .
i wonder why they are not closed yet .
but it just was n't meant to be .
this is simply unacceptable .
not wheelchair accessible and no handicap parking spaces .
left before ordering and wo n't return .
absolutely terrible and slow service .
bill was $ _num_ and i paid _num_ .
i should have walked away without paying .
this place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .
and another _num_ min for mine !
anyway , that was our experience .
it was so confusing .
not a chance we will go back there .
it was such an incredibly rude service .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
poor business practices at encore !
money is not an issue .
i did n't have a coupon .
i could n't see a thing .
this place was gross .
walked in on saturday and walked out .
i would not recommend their pizza at all .
online ordering system sucks .
it is horrible & disgusting !
i 'm so disappointed that they have changed !
no sir , i am not requesting that .
_num_ mistakes i wish i never had done .
he called back but did n't leave a message .
terrible experience with this company .
several repair request were made throughout the year .
it was fixed but only for a few days .
however , by friday morning it was leaking again .
afternoon to an apartment with no a/c .
it was so unbearable to be in there .
the fried shrimp is too oily for my taste .
rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile .
i probably would n't go back .
maybe you should check your order before you leave .
worst `` hawaiian '' i 've ever had .
it was so gummy and tough !
seaweed is not supposed to be chewy like that !
disappointing , even if theirs did use onion .
do n't waste your time or money .
visit the much better hawaiian options in phoenix !
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
do n't waste your time .
wear shoes because the floor is sticky .
steamed rice is steamed rice , it was ok !
seriously just avoid this location altogether .
my rice was so soggy and mushy .
after we ate we felt sick to our stomach .
it smelled so bad like sweaty mildew .
it was unbearable and i wo n't be back .
seriously just avoid this location altogether .
me today : panda express is crap .
gross , plain and simple !
what a waste of money !
but the customer service side sucks .
then she and the manager walked back to me .
is that a garbage can ? ''
`` no , '' she replied .
at this point , the damage was already done .
worse customer service ever !
hoping i do n't get sick off these .
the white rice was old and dry .
i wo n't be back .
im never going back there again .
the cheese was not melted inside .
asking me to pay cash ... whatever .
normally the are not bad .
bean and cheese burrito was awful .
try filiberto 's instead .
egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil .
but today the service was horrible !
we waited _num_ - _num_ mins for _num_ burritos !
no sense of urgency .
two days later , nothing had been called in .
it was downright rude and condescending .
an hour later still no food .
my biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread .
the quality of ham is disgusting .
it 's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring .
i was starving when i ordered it .
so i gave them another chance .
still really grossed out about it .
sadly its the closest one to my apt .
i just threw the sandwich away .
i also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted .
those books are n't on shelves !
oh , and the books are way overpriced .
and i am not a fan of last chance .
probably wo n't be heading back .
this store has a rude and miserable staff .
she was very rude to the customer .
they ruined our shopping day .
this gas station stole my fucking money .
if only there was an option for zero stars !
complete waste of time .
my last customer service experience was horrible .
which is too bad .
i would not even give this store _num_ star .
this is no way to treat employees .
overall , it was n't bad .
seriously only _num_ flavors ?
is n't it _num_ flavors in their name ?
i suggest cold stones or the gelato spot .
they chose to scare me instead .
why the hell would i pay that for _num_ ?
i was flat out lied too .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars .
brian would not return our calls .
when he showed it was the wrong door .
customer service is very poor .
i 'm on my way to baja loco .
i would be very very cautious of this company .
they actually did not have any work .
stay far away from this company .
it is on 30th st and camelback .
too expensive for a haircut .
i would leave zero stars if possible .
they could not even offer that .
_num_ attempts and nothing .
hopefully your experience wo n't be like mine .
are you kidding me ?
i wo n't be going back .
stay away from any western dental !
avoid at all cost !
embarrassed to even set foot there .
very disappointed in the oral surgeon there .
this has been a joke from the get go .
western dental still sucks !
they are no good and should be shut down !
the receptionists are very unprofessional .
with that said , i do n't like chipotle .
this location is a royal pain .
that 's just asking for trouble .
needless to say , i have n't been back .
that 's where i went wrong .
chipotle claims they have gluten free food .
they have lost our frequent business forever .
the issue tonight was a matter of health .
so undercooked that the meat was actually cold .
this location is not as stellar as others .
this location on the other hand is terrible .
spend your money elsewhere .
the place was filthy and the staff was horrible .
example : `` pico and hot salsa . ''
`` sour cream , cheese , and lettuce . ''
so appetizing for $ _num_ .
rice is almost always uncooked .
the staff is not very friendly at all .
tonight they ran out of chips .
in order to avoid this sad restaurant .
why are you ignoring the hundreds of complaints ?
they mess up orders and they take forever !
assuming they just did n't feel like cooking anymore .
online ordering is an absolute joke .
worst chipotle experience i 've ever had .
i 'm offended and wo n't be back .
unfriendly staff and moldy grapes in kids meal .
and the cashier does n't say a word .
_num_ minutes for corn ?
are you kidding me ?
is n't this why i come here ?
this chipotle is consistently horrible !
i went straight from the restaurant to the house .
i have never been to a worse chipotle .
i do n't want to get food poisoning .
guacamole was flat , no flavor .
overall vibe of the place sucked .
not friendly at all .
even the cashier , which surprised me .
rude staff , unclean place .
if you have a problem , talk to management .
but here 's the thing , i have .
do n't waste your time going here !
the rice is undercooked and hard .
a waste of my money .
i had the worst experience at this chipotle !
she was so rude .
i will no longer return to chipotle .
there was n't enough in the first place .
think i 'll go elsewhere next time .
chipotle just is n't worth it any more .
but i was n't expecting to be grossed out .
i 'm not a fan of being ignored .
they got there money , what do they care !
why would they even package this for a customer ?
that was too much for this guy apparently .
also , your a jerk .
shipping is expensive too .
however i waited _num_ min to purchase one item .
wish i would have read the reviews first .
she said no one !
terrible customer service and bad attitude !
not a nice person at all !
would be no stars at this location .
but i wo n't be returning .
but my nails looked like absolute crap .
my massage was a complete waste of time .
in my opinion he used too much polish .
they also did a poor job .
do n't waste your time here .
stopped here because i was in the area .
boy was that a big mistake .
never again will i go back there .
i probably could have done a better job .
would not come back .
very low quality service .
that was one of the worst pedicures ever .
i was so annoyed about how she rushed it .
it was so rushed '' .
i would never go there again .
i guess my money will bother him too .
or if she is just this rude to everyone .
like the other reviewer , i experienced constant delays .
though expensive , i was prepared for this .
this location is terrible .
my sales associate lied to me .
worst apartment complex ever .
it 's incredibly annoying .
im very disappointed in this unit .
are you kidding me ?
needless to say , i left .
needless to say , i left .
the cashier amanda is rude !
under her breath and walked away .
i could n't believe it .
the tenderloin burger was very plain .
so there is absolutely nothing here i would eat .
no reason to return , whatsoever .
way too overpriced for the quality of food !
$ _num_ for _num_ antipasto plates ?
`` so what 's the problem '' you ask ?
but how much am i paying for this dish !
it 's only half a cut of the fish !
the food was just not that great .
and the dessert was just not up to par .
no apology , no nothing .
seriously ... could have been shared by _num_ people .
it was fine , i guess .
not horrible , but really not so great either .
we shared some chocolate dessert , which was good .
unfortunately the magic stops right there .
the whole entree tasted at best bland .
so many things wrong from start to finish .
another thing i can not forgive is the lobster .
desserts were nothing worth writing about .
the service is anywhere from poor to absent .
the food was just average at best .
the food was bland and uninspired .
we will not return here .
expect to leave hungry .
the portions are small and very expensive .
out with the new , in with the old .
it 's been _num_ months .
the problem was with the food .
the service was terrible .
the waitress did not appear friendly at all .
the bar did not seem classy at all .
again , extremely poor service .
i will never visit this place again .
just a bland menu .
disappointed from what it used to be .
no flavor just a plain tasting white fish .
i wo n't return with this menu .
at _num_ $ i expected a little more .
if asked to go again i will skip it .
very expensive and very disappointing both times .
the menu is pretentious .
wait we are in phoenix .
gave away our room !
we could n't believe it .
fell far short of expectations .
guess we really were sol .
this was the most offensive part of the meal .
but they are so short staffed .
had caesar salad w flat iron steak .
it was n't flat iron .
seemed like bad tough cut of sirloin .
nope , not worth it .
especially since their coffee tastes like watered down crap .
: ( i will not be coming back anymore .
some of the employees do n't pay attention .
first , no salt bagels .
are n't salt bagels one of the standards ?
the other half was basically dry .
his second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake .
two weekends in a row is a trend .
sad to say it has not .
dirty , not organized , bad & slow service .
come on people - this is not rocket science .
coming here is our weekend routine .
i was rushed and said `` plain ?
i get into my car and drive off .
that guy checked my bagel and lied to me !
however , do not lie to me .
not a good look my man .
my bagel is the easiest thing ever to remake .
i will not be returning here to any location .
it was like we were not even there .
iv had horrible service before this was beyond that .
wo n't be wasting my time here again .
( mistake number _num_ if anyone is counting ) .
no apology for the whole mess !
i would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing .
stores ok , always have to wait for service .
people wait for a long time to check out .
should have been a quick , cheap job .
this place needs to be put out of business .
they do n't even deserve a single star .
just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual .
no lettuce , tomato , or mayo .
nothing like eating a dry sandwich .
i would skip this location .
how the hell do people eat this .
the bacon on the turkey club was undercooked .
after tonight , i wo n't be back .
oh and the trash can was dirty .
the customer service is n't very friendly either .
you 've given yourselves a bad reputation .
it 's not some high fashion salon !
it 's a cheap hair cut place !
no staff on the floor offering help .
store is really unorganized .
i just left lol .
they refuse to give them a refund to him .
i went there about two years ago .
kudos to a senior still running a store .
he quickly gave me a refund .
would five _num_ stars if i could .
they were just going to keep my money .
arrangement delivered looked very different from picture online .
this is not how you should do business .
the man working was so cold .
so i am over it .
i could not do anything with my family .
shame on you bobby !
the woman working was seriously rude .
made my sandwich completely wrong and super sloppy .
and she was just cranky .
hire someone with a better attitude .
worst deli department i 've ever been to .
however , i 'm done with the arcadia store .
_num_ cashier open with _num_ carts lined up !
bring the damn atm back !
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
there is also no follow up .
it was the first such bill i had received !
sorry dr. smith , you just lost a patient !
i made the situation very uncomfortable .
he 's not a honest person .
do not buy tickets from this company .
annoying , but , whatever .
several complaints have done no good .
walls are very thin .
this place is awful .
this should be no big deal , right ?
it has been _num_ months at this point .
otherwise my poor cat would have went without .
and would not eat .
this was not needed .
inflated prices along with a rude vet .
no fee - no visit .
i 've decided to return to my old vet .
so unnecessary , i hung up .
$ _num_ and a few free samples of treats .
this place is awful !
because i was loyal , i stayed .
the kitten was weak and in poor condition .
she was over the top rude and seemingly snapped .
i spent $ _num_ for blood work .
i would give the hotel itself _num_ to _num_ .
do not get married here !
no one from management met me .
i ordered the flat iron steak and eggs .
this was also disappointing .
this place is not living up to the hype .
spend your hard earned money some place else .
the problem lied in the staff .
management really does n't care what you think .
no way to tell what you might get .
but it was a mess .
worst experience ever at `` _num_ star '' resort !
they have no respect for the working class !
so not a fun experience with the facial .
sorry not enough in my book to bother with .
i must say , i was very disappointed .
also , a little too sweet for my taste .
so take my review or leave it .
_num_ guests , catered lunch , no desserts .
either way , bad business model .
never , never , ever again .
as they should have done .
poor management and only one waiter or waitress .
and that is probably only a maybe !
this place is disgusting .
i 'm disappointed in the quality of the arrangement .
i was not sure if north or south .
however , $ _num_ delivery charge ?
nice party trick but not good at a restaurant .
really mediocre , just plain jane boring sandwiches .
there is nothing to these sandwiches .
will not be returning .
the hot sandwiches were luke warm .
the chip order was not delivered .
the drink order apparently was forgotten as well .
i have been going to sacks for _num_ years .
too sugary and strong spices .
not a lot of ambiance .
my extra ten minutes pass .
do n't let the comments on here fool you .
no one in the club cares .
i was sadly disappointed .
she rushed through and was extremely rude to me .
even the pool was a disappointment .
do n't get me wrong .
not so much anymore .
this place is unbelievable .
avoid this place like the plague .
absolutely nothing to do for kids under _num_ .
basketball court is taken by adults .
no other location seems to have this track record .
i wish they would upgrade their cardio room .
no phone call or a notice to inform us .
it was not cool outside in june .
she never called me back .
parking is a real problem .
i have gotten several bad spanish lattes .
the prices here are n't exactly cheap .
it has a definite european touch .
it is just too darn small and busy .
it 's a shame .
la grande orange grocery has a problem .
unfortunately , it ca n't be all of them .
this place has more hype than actual delivery !
i was mediocre at best !
the breakfast i received was barely room temperature .
the food quality is just so-so .
wish i had more passion for the place ... .
the kitchen was rocking it , though .
it was definitely longer than _num_ minutes .
two two items together totaled $ _num_ .
the grocery area is where you order lunch .
but it was sliced , lunch meat style turkey .
`` no thanks '' i told her .
i find this in poor taste .
i do n't get it .
are you not paying your employees enough ?
i hate tip jars .
did not know that , being my first time .
i wo n't be back .
this place is all hype .
the egg white omelet was flavorless crap !
i 've tried to like this place .
it 's been _num_ months .
trust me , this place is a joke .
the pizza sucks too btw !
no big deal , as it moved quickly .
breakfast however is entirely different .
they ca n't cook eggs !
really disappointed as i live only a block away .
seriously , who makes an awful cupcake ?
the passport ice tea is hit or miss .
why ca n't they brew the ice tea correctly ?
the bad : service was horrible .
the prices however are still way high .
not impressed at all .
took way too long to get my drink refills .
not about a quality dining experience .
also , the food is way over priced .
the atmosphere is very overwhelming .
not french in any way !
do n't waste your time .
uh , theres no bowl back there .
this place was a mess .
the biggest complaint of all is the smell !
will not be going again .
if you are a woman , be warned .
... but no one ever came .
frustrated , as this has been done already .
supposedly the popcorn was on sale for $ _num_ .
yes , they do have sour patch flavored gum .
complete waste of money -- i am returning it .
first , it 's disgusting .
the employees are rude .
the parking is terrible and very busy .
look out or you will get run over .
the breadsticks i got had no seasoning .
the coke was flat .
did n't learn and did n't look last week .
that is not ok !
for anything else , still not a bad place .
instead , they caused an inconvenience for a shopper .
do n't ever use this service .
they had a _num_ pack of all _num_ colors .
i would n't come here again .
they charge too much according to her .
all in all i was n't too impressed .
no , no no .
i do not want a flower .
drive down _num_ more feet for another salon .
i was rushed to the pedicure chair .
never again will i step foot in this shop .
i got the gel french manicure .
unfortunately , my experience was everything but that !
the lady who did my pedi was terrible !
it was such a rush job !
i 'm so livid , even writing this review .
_num_ minute wait for a rushed _num_ minute pedicure .
overall a disappointing waste of money .
went back in and i was treated terrible .
my nails look worse now than they did before .
she is mad at me for hurting me !
i have never had gel nails done so poorly .
just do n't go .
not worth your time or money !
my feet looked so bad !
it is truly sad .
very disappointed , you just lost a new customer !
like not real hipsters .
once again this was 7pm on a sunday .
however , making reservations there is a different story .
they only take reservations for _num_ or more .
they are old and tired .
food was ok bread was stale on my sandwich .
but service was not good at all !
i was told she can not do it .
it 's way too loud in here .
_num_ hours later , we got seated and ignored .
the bruschetta came out quickly but tasted stale .
all-in-all the place was n't bad .
does n't the red wish to breath ?
it simply needs some good floor management .
the parking lot disaster strikes again !
the wines are ok but somewhat pretentious .
nothing worth writing about except the bruschetta .
salads are overpriced and no hot entrees ... unimpressive .
i just left literally _num_ seconds ago .
not fond of high tops either .
lost a star because they opened the garage door .
mediocre bruschetta ( especially for the price ) .
to much goat cheese and the bread ?
i will not be back .
that already left a bad taste in my mouth .
would not even check or anything .
but it did n't last .
once again the doctor would n't talk to me .
she was nice but could provide no information .
she would not even touch my dog .
said her skin is disgusting and she smells .
the veterinary assistants were very friendly .
the vets , however , can be really pushy .
i told him no thanks .
dr. rice was the only vet i liked .
no other vet did that .
no thanks , banfield .
the staff aside from the actual vets are inept .
the lines are ridiculous .
glad i do n't have to shop here again .
this place is the dive bar of grocery stores .
sweat beads down my back .
why did n't u call me ?
`` may i have my money back ? ''
by far the worst fry 's in the valley .
nothing worth a crap .
overpriced with no real selection .
this place is the worse .
unfortunately i have to shop here regularly .
i don '' t want _num_ cases of soda .
`` expired may _num_ , _num_ '' .
just a few months too old .
is the food bad ?
sadly , our other entree was much worse .
nevertheless , had to try the mojito .
so-so and have had better .
i came for lunch today and was very disappointed .
then the food comes and is wrong .
the rice is wet and salty .
too much cilantro all over the place .
this is not mexican is cuban .
rice should not be soup .
couldnt get enough of it .
our food was not good .
the food is barely average and super expensive .
they have definitely messed with the portions though .
the service - really pretty bad .
he gave both of us a really crappy vibe .
quite frankly , it was way over priced .
we started off with _num_ mojitos and some appetizers .
my bf was not impressed with his entree either .
over priced , plastic chairs and the food sucked !
so i had another chicken dish .
was n't horrible but nothing to come back for .
my husband was so annoyed .
it was very ick to me .
she did not offer to bring me something else .
for the appetizer , i ordered the beef empanadas .
the rice was as plain as jane .
the paradise pulled pork was mediocre , at best .
very uncomfortable and extremely tacky .
any latin restaurant that uses minute rice is horrible .
but it does n't warrant my going back .
ago could change for the worse so quickly .
food is awful , place smells .
would not recommend this place at all .
it was that bad .
i did n't get a refill .
third , the portions are small .
and fourth the service was poor .
i will not be back .
just save your money .
anyway will definitely wo n't ever go back ... .
unfortunately , our dinner just kept disappointing .
minutes to be seated .
stopped by here on saturday night .
so bad for business .
truly wish the previous owners would come back .
they are rude and do n't care about customers .
no name tag on his shirt .
rang up to _num_ $ ?
i wo n't be back .
tortilla was undercooked and barely any meat .
it 's written like an advertisement .
looks do n't beat good service .
and by alcoholic i mean `` owner '' specifically .
they were rude and not sorry for the situation .
not my kind of place .
the worst customer service experience in a long time .
thank you for wasting _num_ hours of my saturday .
this is my final straw though .
paid a little over $ _num_ .
this is a terrible experience .
the owner ( wife ) , is extremely rude !
do n't bother with this place !
my _num_ year old and i were stunned !
we could n't believe what was happening .
i have also never been treated this way before .
do not do business with these unethical people !
went for lunch and was very disappointed .
restaurant smells musty and the food was awful .
was it outrageously priced ?
would i eat here again if someone invited me ?
the sauce was kind of bland .
the weather was cold , so i wanted soup .
i ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls .
i was disappointed with the quality of food .
the pork ribs were also just bland .
the food was n't very good .
our entire dinner was bland .
no flavor , no heat , and no veggies .
it was not worth the trip .
no veggies or meat , basically white rice .
two bites , toss .
first , i ordered wor wonton soup .
then came my chicken chow mein .
do n't eat here !
over all , i will not be going back .
but nothing else would bring me back .
i was n't about to dig through the trash .
the dish that we had was void of flavor .
the texture was off , almost rubbery .
i took one bite and was disappointed .
the kitchen is very poorly managed .
just know it will be a very long wait .
i would not recommend this dish to anyone .
avoid this place at all costs .
my boyfriend went here for an allergy test .
the worst customer service experience i have ever had .
they have no courtesy or manners what so ever .
i am really dissatisfied with the place .
she saw my til _num_ .
i went with _num_ other friends .
there were _num_ meatballs for $ _num_ .
we had a hamburger it was a little dry .
this dish was an embarrassment to salads .
unfortunately our lunch was only fair .
our waiter was so-so .
this review is about rude , rude wally .
she never even asked if i was finished .
i personally was not thrilled about that .
needless to say this ruined the meal experience completely .
our server was not very friendly .
i just left a sad tip .
so now the omelet is $ _num_ ridiculous .
the huevos rancheros sucked .
very bland , nothing great at all .
so we drove to ihop ... which was packed .
for like $ _num_ ?
$ _num_ for oj ?
literally one of the worst dining experiences ever .
i wish i would have waited in line .
there were several less than pleasant surprises .
my daughter 's eggs came out almost within seconds .
it was also not warm .
that surprise was a $ _num_ meal .
my eggs benedict was not warm ... again !
we will not go back .
this was just one disappointment after another .
thank you for that waste of time .
not cooked at all !
costco referred me to this place .
would you believe $ _num_ !
i lost the screw in my glasses .
this guy totally bait and switched me .
they sent me to the frame doctor .
for $ _num_ i would have expected more .
no ... scratch that , i must vent .
wow , what a disaster .
yep , that 's it .
and no refills on the sodas , either .
some greasy chinese crispy noodles .
the place is a rat hole !
one long tray of fried chicken ... .
only one thing missing .
no refill in drinks except ice tea .
tasteless does n't begin to describe that dish !
it was surprisingly busy .
so , why was it so busy ?
will i get sick this time or not ?
you never see a dermatologist ... only a pa .
i would highly recommend staying away from this place .
google it , it 's pretty nasty .
i met the doctor for only _num_ minutes .
this was the first frustrating issue .
this office is very incompetent .
however , i know that it was .
( none of them were `` cheap . '' )
i use to cry myself to sleep every night .
they would n't tell me .
this time it was extremely frustrating .
the office staff is incompetent in my experience .
you can never get through to scheduling .
not impressed for all the good reviews .
my acrylics tho was a totally different story .
very rude man by the way .
she 's lucky she got a _num_ $ tip .
this place just refused service .
i will not be coming back !
there work has got so poor !
especially this dude they hired .
over priced for the less then mediocre work .
also it 's not very clean .
most horrible nail salon ever .
also the salon was hot as shit .
these qualities are opposite of a dive bar .
another pretentious take over .
i 've never been treated worse by a bartender .
but to get yelled at like that was crazy .
i would rather shoot pool at river city pockets .
this will never be the dilly again .
my dog does n't have _num_ weeks left .
not a good first impression .
not the dunkin donuts that everyone remembers .
not the best run dunkin ' donuts .
i like dunkin ' but the service sucks .
so i went to this place a few times .
mcdonalds has better coffee .
qt gas stations have better coffee .
our enchiladas were stone cold .
ordered _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
got home _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
sorry pollo , you are off my lunch list !
it 's _num_ ' inside .
i mean , really ?
it felt like a chicken fried steak .
the bill for two came to approx $ _num_ .
we started our meals with salads .
my entree was equally as disappointing .
unfortunately , this time that was not the case .
to start with , service was far too leisurely .
not enough herbs to really flavor it .
no side dishes come with it .
my husband hated his .
not the best and a little vinegary .
do n't use coupon !
you ate looked down upon and treated poorly .
there are much better italian restaurants in phoenix .
ok quick tip food service industry .
not that they were not kind , or attentive .
also , they did n't clean the shrimp .
worst italian food ever .
i do n't know where to start .
this place is way past its prime .
this place has the worst service .
the prices here are an absolute joke .
her price is $ _num_ !
this place is a complete joke .
it was a waste of time .
such a waste of time .
if you are going here you are getting robbed .
just awful awful customer service and communication with customers !
$ _num_ it came out to !
i find that to be quite rude .
seriously my experience with this place was awful .
the guys serving was very friendly yet slow .
told you , lots of excuses and false promises .
on the whole a really lousy job .
left no tip and would certainly not recommend .
quite possibly the worst experience of my life .
they also have a nice punch card system .
they will tell you need a transmission flush .
complete and utter rip off !
horrible customer service and terribly rude over the phone .
this place is awful !
refused to top off all my fluids .
when asking for my keys back , he refused .
i wish i could give zero stars !
$ _num_ later , i have my laundry .
and then hung up on me .
i would absolutely never come back here .
i strongly advise to stay away from this place .
shame on arcadia cleaners !
there was absolutely nothing wrong with the house .
no extra cost for hardware .
lots of promises but no other options given .
your food is bland and nasty .
the buns were really mushy .
well , the chili was disgusting .
so so sweet ... so un edible .
they have a turkey burger which sounds good .
the burger and fries are nothing special ... .
be prepared for patties cooked in old grease .
nothing special here , especially for the price .
does n't look clean .
i wo n't be back .
chili - there was sugar in the recipe .
i did not like .
nothing like white castle .
it is not a dirty odor .
i am sitting in the restaurant writing this review .
maybe i should have tried the sliders .
fast forward to arizona .
good idea , but way too heavy .
i ate it , but the experience was disappointing .
sad sad example of sliders .
staff was not friendly .
horrible customer service , would not go back .
miss the old owners .
kids do n't count .
just lost my business .
_num_ days later they are dead .
you have _num_ % lost my family 's business !
so much for trying to support local businesses .
this is just terrible customer service !
i told him , my lemon tree was struggling .
i would n't rush out to this place .
thai curry has the peanut sauce and curry base .
this place is the equivalent of salt lick thai .
i have been here _num_ times .
they brought me a rice dish .
tonight was the night .
did n't think it would be a big deal .
that is a big fail right there !
she , unfortunately , spoke very little english .
we made our order , beginning with chicken satay .
the only thing good is the price .
certainly not the food and definitely not the service .
i have tried this place _num_ times .
the food is not very good .
the food is bland , overcooked and pretty americanized .
i decided to go there and place my order .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated .
then waited another ten minutes before leaving .
very dated decor is another negative .
worst thai we 've ever had .
greasy , gross , packaged mix flavors .
chicken satay was underwhelming .
there was no apology .
you wo n't be disappointed .
there just is n't .
it was a monday night , somewhat busy .
the rice was soggy .
the service was terrible .
i did n't see one smile from either server .
my pad thai was delivered without the peanuts .
ordered eggplant and green curry with chicken .
eggplant wasnt even near cooked and tasted like leather .
too many other spots to get your fix .
the waitress & the cook were extremely rude !
i walked out and wo n't be back again .
i only wish i did .
life is too short to eat bad thai food !
everything was over cooked and mushy .
the veggies were not cooked still raw .
not worth it at all .
do n't waste your time here .
worst customer service experience ever !
they were n't helpful at all .
in fact , they were actually quite rude .
they refused to take the bed back .
i did n't even have it for _num_ hours .
( that 's why i called _num_ times . )
i would not recomend this shop .
dishonest ... pricing is horrible .
i agree with the _num_ star rating .
nothing is written as return policy .
never ever going back .
horrible customer service and terrible return policy .
walked around , nobody came in .
i would not recommend this company .
customer service is not a priority at this business .
do n't waste your time here .
she did not get that .
the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
it 's just started to get ridiculous .
it pains me to write this review .
but , i must yelp the truth .
someone else had picked up my clothes .
but , i ca n't .
the dr. never returned my call .
i would give them a zero if i could .
i 'm so mad .
more than _num_ minutes later !
i will never see that horrible woman again .
i am so sorry i did .
this kfc is horrible !
( i know , kinda weird ) .
i ordered the _num_ piece boneless chicken breast meal .
i will never go back to this kfc again .
this place is trash .
surprisingly the server was very quick with the bill .
greasy , flavorless and unappealing .
but the food was horrible .
the owner was so rude i walked out !
the food here is mediocre at best .
the owner is rude along with the waitresses .
the food is mediocre or less .
i will not be returning to this establishment .
boy was i wrong .
they only accept cash be warned .
this year _num_ it 's $ _num_ .
she was down right rude !
this is total bs .
is n't this the cost of doing business ?
this , unfortunately , is not one of them .
insurance companies do not pay the fee .
this place just has terrible customer service .
monday is a holiday and i am in pain .
no help offered whatsoever by the person taking appointments .
once she left , i should have too .
very upset that the practice charges a ridiculous fee .
do n't go here !
this place is nasty dog .
this used to be our favorite breakfast place .
i 'm really disappointed .
the food is bomb .
never had this issue .
i was n't asking for anything for free .
will not shop there again !
worst customer service ever .
good prices but bad service .
i had requested a saturday morning delivery online .
on saturday morning i had not received a call .
they lost another customer .
i purchased a $ _num_ sectional from them .
so we wandered up there on our own .
s : oh , we work in rooms .
and he walked away .
so - we walked out .
and i wo n't be back .
needless to say we went elsewhere .
poor customer service , in my opinion .
they said no and suggested i cancel my order .
i should 've cancelled my order there .
they holding my money for a week .
boy , was i wrong .
skip the phoenix showroom if at all possible !
not earlier , not later .
this place is not what it used to be .
it was supposed to be delivered in a week .
learn from my mistake .
that 's over _num_ more weeks with no couch .
seriously , no one cares about you here .
extremely disappointed in the business .
i spoke with pam and i explained the situation .
safety is not their concern !
it 's nightmare management !
the food is not so good .
i was too annoyed to care .
the chicken was dry and chewy .
i just do n't get the draw .
it was too salty and lacking in other flavors .
thanks for the disgusting food .
food poisoning - april _num_ , _num_ .
( sesame instead of honey seared . )
stopped in for dinner about 8pm tonight .
these containers obviously do n't get washed .
i 've never seen a kitchen so bad .
the food was more disgusting than the restaurant .
today ; wtf pei wei ?
unprofessional , sloppy , and rude .
none of us will be back .
i guess the customer service took away my hunger .
the rice is dry .
it 's too bad .
the restaurant would n't honor the coupon .
now for the worst part ... .
did not even feel me up !
it 's called little shanghai .
however , i wo n't be going back .
i do not recommend this place .
alexander then hung up on me .
he did n't install a new anything .
i will never return to alexander 's auto .
$ _num_ for the small blizzard .
these guys are n't experts .
that was absolute bs .
worst bike shop ever !
not $ _num_ total !
avoid bike barn at all costs !
unfortunately bike barn is a typical phoenix shop .
do n't know what , the store was empty .
i wo n't be back .
i 'm sure i 'm not the only one .
definitely a mixed review for me .
happily they called _num_ days later .
friendly but dishonest staff .
they simply are not trustworthy .
honestly i was frustrated .
i was just really disappointed .
it was $ _num_ .
ugh , these guys are such crooks .
the crystal was still cracked .
after all that , nothing had been done .
what a complete waste of time .
first off , he rudely snapped at me .
no , just no !
drove a long way for nothing .
not a great way to gain new customers .
additionally , they got my order wrong !
this place is a rip off !
dirty lobby and dinning room .
this pizza hut is not okay .
( however , the delivery guy was great .
just a fail all around .
this pizza hut is terrible .
their service could n't be worse .
it was absolutely horrible .
i 'm sorry but that 's unacceptable .
of course it 's cold ... .
this place clearly lacks in delivery and customer service .
order was almost _num_ minutes late .
pasta was dry and crusty .
this place was just as it is reviewed .
not paying attention when u r paying with card .
love pizza hut hate this location .
one of the worst locations !
i am still haunted by this bathroom experience .
not at this time .
do you want premium , high temp oil ?
no just regular oil .
the pressure is too high . ''
no more jiffy lube for this girl !
which did not feel genuine .
there is simply nothing jiffy about this place .
i have replaced bulbs before so declined .
it 's a mess .
i do n't give bad reviews .
i will not be coming back here again .
could you not call and let us know ?
the man that did my locks was extremely unpleasant .
there was no greeting just a dirty look .
when i saw followed i mean through every aisle !
tires were not leaking air just the rim .
disappointed in this decision .
i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
i went in to get my tire change .
this is an all time low .
finding a new doctor because of this unfortunately .
he seemed very rushed as well .
does n't make much sense .
maybe he just needs to stick with breasts !
do n't let him touch your face !
this is the worst break masters in town .
save your money please do n't make my mistake .
posted on the window is $ _num_ oil change .
i will not be back .
the fried duck was overcooked and dry .
ordered some thing simple , mongolian beef .
i do n't mean med rare or rare .
what a waste of money !
the ridiculous reply was .
the crab puffs were missing a key ingredient ... .
that was really disappointing .
not sure we will give them another try .
what a disappointing experience .
the crab puffs appeared stale and tasteless .
no lobster in seafood platter .
pushy and rude waitress .
$ _num_ for some noodles and burnt chicken .
reasonably priced but the food was not good .
the orange chicken was bland .
probably wo n't be ordering again .
it was just on the other side of gross .
such a sad , sad change .
so this is why people come and go here.
but alas , the owner .
would n't you want this too ?
but your job is to b.s .
did your company help , hell no !
after she left , monica replaced her .
this turned out to be a big mistake .
the lights barely make it to the ground .
just look at the lights and ask yourself why ?
is this what i pay rent every month for ?
that 's a complete lie .
that 's just bad bad customer service .
normally love this place but today was disappointing .
ordered the house chicken togo .
very disappointed ... never going back !
bad food , bad service .
the beef broccoli tasted like dead cats .
so i ate it .
this place serves a poor excuse for japanese food .
not terrible food , but not good either .
this place was just extremely underwhelming .
it was very bland .
which looked way better than what i ordered .
the worst food i 've ever had .
the teriyaki sauce tasted bland and watered down .
the vegetables were limp and flavor less .
i will never step foot in this establishment again .
i do n't know how this place stays open .
the food is horrible .
i essentially put $ _num_ dollars in trash can .
then leaves it like that .
there is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere .
this place is a train wreck in a refrigerator .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
not surprisingly , again the call never came .
this was june 25th .
i am so frustrated .
fred will not be busy for long .
not even that tasty .
i mean $ _num_ - _num_ for pasta ?
food was overpriced and restaurant not that nice .
not very impressed , food was just ok.
there were barely any in the dish .
and the shrimps ... are you kidding me ?
overpriced entrees , underwhelming food .
unfortunately , we were significantly disappointed .
cold plates and food .
our food was cold and tasteless .
do not waste your money at this restaurant !
unfortunately , the food was less than mediocre .
the quality does n't justify the stiff prices .
it was after 9pm saturday night .
the worst experience in my life .
it got worse from there .
our entrees were completely bland .
this evening it was nothing like our previous experience .
the dishes were all lacking flavor .
i was so disappointed by the food .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
the only one i 've seen all night .
visited for restaurant week and was disappointed .
salad of field greens was tasteless .
you ca n't fake diarrhea .
i do n't care why it happened .
like i said , you ca n't fake diarrhea .
was the wine that expensive ?
did we order anything extraordinary ?
are we going back ?
-- just lettuce and tomato , nothing else .
the dressing was pretty bland too .
i do n't think i would return on purpose .
it was just horrible after that .
the service was a little awkward .
it was very mediocre .
the food was not that great .
would not go back bc of service .
without waiting for a response or caring .
not even worth eating .
it 's unfortunate because we liked this place .
decent donuts but horrible coffee ... .
the shop is not impressive nor are the donuts .
donuts are stale , not enjoyable .
if i could give a negative rating i would .
that i want to pay my bill .
i ca n't believe they call themselves professionals .
i wish i could give them a negative rating .
do n't come here , go anywhere else !
we were rushed to pack up and get out .
this is pathetic way of treating people .
you could drop dead in the waiting room .
very disappointed in the customer service with this hospital !
not going there again .
not sure what happened but it was very unprofessional .
this place is a disgrace .
waste of my time and money .
terrible hospital to deal with once you 've left .
how can they deny it happened ?
he lost _num_ % use of his shoulder !
is n't your job to cure people ?
the staff is still incompetent in the mri area .
if i could give zero stars i would .
it 's better than nothing .
one warning , the home fries are typically undercooked .
the eggs and bacon were just bad .
i would rather have gone to mcdonalds honestly .
overall , it was a horrible experience .
no fries , no bun - just a patty .
hello , i 'm a huge panda lover .
all of the negative reviews do not surprise me .
i 'm not expecting gourmet food here .
however this visit was disappointing .
not sure i 'd do the online thing again .
i 'll be throwing the leftovers away .
yelp totally led me wrong here !
i called ahead , ordered _num_ large pepperoni pizza .
this thing looked terrible .
there were literally pools of grease .
it was very similar to trying to eat cardboard .
not impressed , nor a fan .
the entire thing was flavorless .
none not the sauce or the crust .
i doubt i would be back .
we wo n't be trying this place again .
it was n't any better cold the next day .
unfortunately , it was awful .
the sauce was missing !
it just tasted like dough .
what a waste of money !
well , we were very disappointed .
it was very vinegary .
really expected more from this place .
i made my own large pepperoni and sausage pizza .
the dough was pretty horrific .
avoid this place at all costs .
that was the only good thing about it .
the mozzarella sticks were cold .
the garlic bread was not good .
never gon na order from there again .
the pizza really had no flavor .
i will not go back .
are you kidding me ?
i have spent hundreds of dollars at this store .
according to him , impossible .
i went in here to check out the facility .
highly do not recommend this place .
seems very poorly run .
i wish there was a minus one .
to which i turned around and walked out .
it was worse than bad .
there is no excuse for this .
unfortunately the husband did them .
horrible job , is an understatement !
they look like garbage .
he says dumb & rude things .
he was so rude .
_num_ star because i ca n't give _num_ .
the service : long lines and unpleasant cashiers .
the calls always come through as adobe carpet cleaning .
do not use these people .
_num_ is the number they call from .
adobe has done furniture cleaning for me before .
no conditioner , nada .
never use adobe carpet cleaning .
i do not recommend them !
what a waste of money !
_num_ day guarantee forget that !
far , far away .
stop calling my home .
i do n't even have any carpeting !
horrible is the only word i could use .
warning warning do not use these people .
that 's a $ _num_ price difference !
so i had it checked out elsewhere .
nothing had changed here in two decades .
the restaurant interior looked exactly as i had remembered .
just fish and dry cabbage in a tortilla ?
first , she 's not a new waitress .
no slaw dressing , not even a lime .
that explains why they were so salty .
all and all a very disappointing trip .
waited _num_ minutes for our waitress .
the queso app was ok , but nothing special .
then prices went up and quality declined .
now it seems like an overpriced fast food place .
but that 's really all i would recommend .
everything else is mediocre and super cheesy .
the skinny margaritas are not that good .
tacos were soaked in grease .
they were obnoxious , yelling f bombs constantly .
loaded with crap it did not even taste good .
after that , our tacos were not so appetizing !
too bad because my boyfriend loves this place .
atmosphere is very dated .
spicy wings are too spicy .
long wait , food was a mess and unappealing .
one of the worst places i 've been .
for such a big venue it was extremely empty .
the food was so bland .
completely unsatisfied with the service and food .
as for the food , it had no taste !
will not recommend this place or go back .
good food bad service .
this is not the place it used to be .
portion was just smaller .
then to our favorite pollo fundido .
the worst was the fajitas which were bland .
needless to say , they where still terrible .
it has a dirty feel to it .
the meat had little to no seasoning !
sadly , this was definitely not the case .
the jalepeno cheese muffins were good .
overall , confusing and strange .
i do n't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce .
oh well , no big deal .
went to kitchen to inspect pizza .
this household does n't eat animals .
i could n't eat it .
i have to say i was extremely disappointed .
i will not be eating her again .
he was unfortunately , terribly wrong .
pizza seemed like it had too much cheese .
not the pizza for me .
the food is mediocre at best .
but they run the place poorly .
she was told it would be _num_ minutes .
we left , i will never go back .
are you kidding me ?
that raspberry filling was atrocious .
i wish i could give zero stars .
sassy glasses falls short everywhere else however .
overpriced , poor quality , bad customer service .
do n't waste your money .
but the bugs really are too much .
the office is a nightmare situation .
i 'm so glad to be gone !
i would not recommend this community .
the front office is an absolute mess .
started off great and ended very poorly .
after moving i still owed $ _num_ .
why the hell did i waste my time cleaning ?
not recommended at all .
i would not recommend this pharmacy to anyone .
because you just fell into the category of walmart .
the place has gone downhill a little bit .
i would not take my children back here .
that was so creepy .
that is an absurd price .
the hours say that this store opens at 7:30 .
the food is not even mediocre it sucks !
unfortunately i was unimpressed with the food .
unfortunately , the service was really slow .
it was downhill from there .
they , however , are not the meal .
that said , the food was sorely lacking .
in other words , they were very flaky .
it held together very poorly .
bad , just bad .
are you kidding me ?
drink , but whats the point if it sucks .
that being said , tonight was a disaster .
so , i get it in a sense .
it would 've saved me a lot of time .
look elsewhere , would be my advice .
not a fan of that .
i have never been treated so badly .
the server , cindy , was the worst !
she was so rude .
the food came and it was awful .
they were completely dry and almost inedible .
i can not believe the treatment we received .
this woman should not be in the service industry .
but this behavior was inexcusable and shocking .
cindy was the rudest server i have ever had .
they have very limited choices for vegetarians .
i am half mexican myself .
maybe traditional in your family .
bacon was a luxury .
a rude , angry bitter old man .
just warning anyone who might have an event here .
the salsa and chips are overrated .
the carne asada burrito was horrible .
it tasted like charred asada .
unfortunately it never came .
otherwise she would not have seen much .
terrible service , hotel food .
is n't this breaking some sort of yelp rule ?
there are many better choices .
ate dinner here a week ago .
did not like the food .
i would rather pay than eat that buffet again .
not excited to try that again .
-the cheese crisp was ok .
its like a bad night in mexico .
service sucked , but the food sucked more .
well , got off to a bad start .
i wish i would have ordered something else .
_num_ who puts black olives in their salsa ?
my family went for lunch on a weekday .
i think it is long overdue for a cleaning .
nothing but poor service and poorly cooked food .
terrible experience , do n't sit on the patio .
the place was slow so there was no excuse .
so dissatisfied we went to denny 's afterwards .
sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos ?
not going to eat here again .
it was pretty forgettable .
waited _num_ min for food , we walked out .
the service was so so bad .
the restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy .
thank god we walked out when we did !
i give it _num_ star for diet pepsi .
probably wo n't be back .
too late ; we had to sit inside .
they refused to split the tab .
the food was typical mexican food .
i ca n't remember worse service at a restaurant .
the food is n't so great here .
like they are too good to clean it .
they were n't even that busy .
food weak bland , lacked interest or taste .
disappointed in the food .
the items we ordered were flavorless .
our server was seriously super slow .
for dessert , which were all polished off .
i was here a good _num_ years ago .
my how things go bad so quickly !
the food i ordered was ok .
i can eat fire so this is no surprise .
my son 's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it .
i called the waitress over and explained .
another _num_ minutes for our check to come back .
i 'll never go back again .
just nothing to write home about .
of course this pissed me off .
that did not make it ok .
food was awful , not good at all .
overall , not a good experience .
vegetarians beware everything is made w/ meat .
safe w/ grilled veggies .
their flour tortillas were awful !
do n't bother with this place .
myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment .
never coming back to this establishment .
i doubt we 'll be back .
then only a partial delivery .
my carnitas tacos came out cold and dry .
the place is obviously very poorly managed .
it made for an unpleasant dinner .
eating here is not recommended ... .
the only saving grace was tonight 's band ... .
cheap food , cheap service .
that 's why you 're getting this horrible review .
the bartender was a bitch too with attitude .
this team was an embarrassment to your program .
overall wasted an hour just on wait time .
wo n't be returning .
a boring bean burrito is _num_ dollars !
i wo n't be visiting this location again .
they were overcooked and oddly spiced .
the beer was cold though .
left a _num_ % tip on credit card receipt .

beans taste like dirt .

this used to be our favorite coffee spot .
seems to have gone down hill a bit .
not the same friendly employees and quality is lacking .
this is not a four star coffee joint .
she did n't have a reason for it .
very disappointed with this company .
they stuck us with this obnoxious company .
they are rude unprofessional and generally default to horrible .

they are also filed uneven .
do not go to this nail shop .
terrible place to get nails done .
worst gel mani of my life .
the lady was really rude .
she literally covered my cuticles .
no manager or owner on duty .
thanks for wasting my time and money .
she used a rude tone to say that .
and did n't even look at me.
pei wei -- i miss the good times .
it seems like they just do n't care .
& i will not come back again .
i 'm not sure what to think anymore .
have been back since they switched back though .
somehow the food does n't seem as good .
today was really strange though .
lost all interest after that .
all empty tables were dirty - all eight tables .
it was lunchtime and busy .
service like mcdonald 's counter .
would we return to big daddy 's ?
did n't take long to figure out why .
no monday night happy hour .
no happy hour any day of the week .

steak fries came and were uncooked .
sea bass good but dry .
good waiter but horrible food .
brussel sprouts were soggy also .

she was rough and rushed the whole time .
not to mention they changed the prices last minute .
dont waste your time or money on this dump .
my tech clearly could not understand much english .
so i handed over $ _num_ .
she said , rudely , `` no !
extra for taking off your old polish ! ''
i would never return , obviously .
that 's a pitiful way to run a business .
what a horrible experience !
i will never go back .
she is a horrible business owner .
i would suggest to try another nail salon !

worst pedicure i 've ever gotten .
and $ _num_ for a freakin pedicure ?
they just want to get you in and out .
take your money elsewhere .
was not impressed with this place at all .
just this huge wall of products .
the place is a cluttered mess .
i could n't believe it .
there is nothing soothing about this salon .
i was very dissapointed .
i will not be returning to the salon .
i left the salon with almost black hair .
instead was a mess .
furthermore my hair was not even styled properly !
never had this happen before .
2nd , no refund or potential fix .
the worst $ _num_ i have ever spent !
service was done , price was ok .
crooks and i 'm never going back .
the box he was in was very tacky .
this is where things went downhill .
she placed us in another waiting room .

my last nurse was horrible !
i have never been treated this way before .
she was in pain .
my daughter is _num_ and knows pain .

sometimes you do n't even get that .
terrible communication , wo n't return calls or emails .
i have never been treated so rudely .
they do n't care if they ruin your clothes .
my garage door opener died a few weeks ago .
it broke down _num_ days later , same issue .
but geez ... horrible customer service .
note : my home warranty company chose this company .
the tech was aggressive , & refused to wait .
good thing i did n't have to shoot him .
the tech was aggressive , & refused to wait .
good thing i did n't have to shoot him .
that was _num_ days ago !
how they are in business i have no idea .
do not use this company !
there were n't any other problems with my door .
pretty blah , really .
not horrible , but also not worth the price .
nothing special about the decoration .
kind of plain could of used some cleaning .
we get our drinks and wait and wait .
this is your typical mom and pop place .
not so with this one .
we walked in and were seated promptly .
hard , greasy , horrible .
not your typical machaca .
i would not visit here again .
do not eat at this restaurant .
the mild salsa just tasted like cilantro .
the green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome !
the refried beans were n't fresh at all .
really would n't recommend this spot at all .
not bad , not good , just average .
worse mexican food i 've ever had !
$ _num_ for a tiny burrito .
chips and salsa what mexican restaurant charges for that ?
food was ok but not worth going back .
whatever they 're doing just is n't effective .
i would not recommend at all !
in all , do not use this service !
all this information would have been great weeks ago .
she just stared at me .
easily the worst customer service experience of my life .
my home warranty company sent them out .
lazy , crooked and awful .
never again will i use this place .
the contractor then denied causing the damage .
it 's tuesday and - nothing .
needless to say , i 'm contacting another company .
do n't give them your money .
this is really an incompetent company .
really think twice before using this company .
plus their service is terrible .
yet another reason this shop is very bad .
i said no i do n't have cash .
do not use this location !
too bad their work is not consistent .
do n't go here .
not a lot of integrity .
out of wings ... really ?
cold pizza & flat soda .
dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors .
very disappointed and unhappy .
these guys are a mess .
and maybe the pizza would have been hot .
she said she would cancel and refund the order .
the experience was disappointing .
the spaghetti was beyond overcooked .
it just turned to mush .
the sauce , left a lot to be desired .
they advertise italian sausage pieces in it .
they got the order wrong .
then they overcharged me .
wo n't go back .
i am very disappointed .
i would not go back to this shop .
went to central care care for a diagnostic .
i would not trust them with my bicycle .
i will never return here .
they have spa chairs for pedicures .
the polish is sloppy .
they do n't look neat and clean .
i could not wait so i rescheduled the appointment .
i replied no and i left the salon .
i will not be returning .
they are not running a professional business .
i will not be returning .
horrible horrible customer service and work .
horrible horrible customer service and work .
looks like i 'm back to fixing it myself .
i would avoid them at all costs .
the park is very pro smoking and pets .
the canned foods in the grocery area are dusty .
but instead i feel ripped off .
what a disgrace to italian food .
perhaps next time i should get a sub .
then things got worse .
real harsh and angry .
probably not the best choice for any business .
they iron your shirt from wet to dry .
they told me they did not have my clothes .
she would not even give us a name .
real harsh and angry .
probably not the best choice for any business . ''
well it went downhill from there .
dryers did not dry .
after about _num_ mins i walked out .
there are better stores .
half of them are n't labeled or priced .
warning do not go here !
( edit : apple tree died . )
called again to check ; no call back .
called to complain -- no call back .
well , no one knows -- it just is .
i should give negative stars !
my oil plug was n't put back in properly .
my car leaked all the oil .
we cant even register an oil reading .
completely ruined this trip !
shame on you guys !
all of my dog 's tests came back negative .
long story short , i felt ripped off .
this place is horrible !
this place is horrible !
the tech was awful .
the tech said it was going to be _num_ .
horrible hospital , very impersonal !
the doctor only cares about money and is rude !
you do not call your customers liars !
customer service leaves much to be desired .

boy was i wrong !
what a horrible experience !
they are overly disorganized .
the food is bland .
horrible food choices besides the salads .
there is no atmosphere really .
the food is mediocre at best .
the vibe is lame .
waitress was unfriendly and too busy .
i wo n't be back .
the prices are n't that great .
normally i love this place but today management failed .
went here tonight , will never be back .
but the service was beyond bad .
the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks .
i was craving wings .
sat down greeted by the bartender .
he said nothing to us .
but went around to all other tables .
so i walked out .
this has happened on more than one occasion .
do n't care to ever come back .
so were my friends ' sloppy nachos and quesadilla .
we made a mistake going there .
the lettuce was terrible .
limp is one way to describe it .
the bartender was very inattentive and rude .
good place for a beer , skip the food .
the place was dark and pretty much empty .
the cheese dip was horrible !
it was thick and cold .
the burgers were huge but not that great .
my husband then asks for fried fish .
he did n't finish it .
the spring rolls have the texture of dried cardboard .
moist cardboard would be an improvement .
not great but i ate it .
only white rice was offered with the orange chicken .
i did n't really like anything i ordered .
frankly , i was just really unimpressed .
i wo n't be back .
we 're not coming back .
i was totally unsatisfied .
i can say i was sorely disappointed .
entres lack flavor and are very oily .
husband and i went tonight .
water does n't taste very good .
wo n't be back .
unfortunately both meals we ordered were barely edible .
the crispy duck was mostly fat and lacked flavor .
second disappointment - the pizza .
third disappointment - the salad .
i hate giving bad reviews .
very poor customer service skills .
they did n't even apologize .
overpriced for such bad service .
the whole experience was pathetic and disappointing .
no apologies , no concern ... nothing .
wo n't be going back .
she was not a good example of customer service .
so no one to talk to .
i did n't feel like a valued customer .
i will not be coming back .
i hate liars and incompetent management .
( this explained no cars in the lot ) .
the choices are limited and not that good .
i waited for _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later no omelette .
three minutes later , still no waitress .
i walked out hungry .
went back for lunch .
it was a big mistake .
not once did my water get refilled .
no one asked me how my lunch was .
i 'm never coming back .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
not even _num_ star !

i have them such a glowing review before .
i am really disappointed .
they were quite helpful .
open road tours nearly ruined our vacation !
very plain , nothing special .
i ended up throwing my food away .

total disregard for client 's time .
terrible as most said something changed .
stay away and do n't waste your money .
thanks but no thanks .

unless you want to be disappointed .
the pharmacist and the tech both ignored my existence .
after _num_ minutes , someone acknowledged me .
then stared at me like i was an idiot .

avoid this location at all costs .
worst pharmacy experience ever .
well it 's clear i was wrong .
my partner and i have had nothing but problems .

i ate about three small bites and gave up .
it was almost flavorless .
this place should be avoided at all costs .
why ca n't i just order what i want ?

it was terrible in the worst way .

so off to wendy 's across the street .
how does one mess up cheese fries ?
we ordered _num_ number _num_ meals .
worst breakfast burrito and coffee i 've ever had .
threw it in the trash and left .
i 'm disappointed nearly every time i go here .
store is just too small .
variety sucks , prices suck .
then she walked away for something .
maybe i just ordered the wrong dish .
but it was n't served like that .
they are rude every single time .
not at this location .
it 's wendy 's gross !
tasted like it had been sitting for awhile .
it was really slow .
they seriously make me sick .
they have no idea what customer service is whatsoever .
this place will mess up your order every time .
selling old food is not good for business .
the store near bell and 7th st. was filthy .
worse `` ray 's '' i 've been too !
it was just sauce and little but of cheese .
too bad , because the crust was excellent .
paid for ranch and got home and no ranch .
what a terrible experience for a well reviewed place .
insulting and honestly ... .
service was neither friendly nor rude .
i do n't like eating cheap food .
this is a horrible excuse for a cleaners .
quick service , poor quality .

the customer service there is terrible .

i wo n't return to this location .
i will never step foot in this place again .
no one returned my call .
so i made another follow-up two days later .
one time there was no water for _num_ hours .
no customer should ever be treated like this .
would n't even look at my item nor me .
just kept staring into space .
it appears there are new owners .
the buffet items are overly greasy and spiced oddly .
just stopped for lunch before driving off .
probably wo n't ever go back .
really , it sucked .
they seemed to hate me for some reason .
the chicken masala was ok as well .
not a welcoming place .
_num_ stars from the vegan perspective .

regardless of that , it simply is n't good .
i stopped to get two different kinds of wings .
the _num_ stars are for the disappointing wings .
they were really bad .
salad was good , the pizza was horrible .
this place is questionable at best .
my food was barely over room temp at best .
streets of new york pizza is awful .
they over charge and their ingredients are sub par .
all it consists of is soggy tomatoes and cheese .
it was average at best .
oh , lets not get to carried away here .

and seven dollars for mac-n-cheese , that is outrageous !
the bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese .
oh , and the shrimp was boiled .
rather than coming here , just eat the money .
the pizza was very bland .
too bad , i really wanted to like it .
this place was terrible .
ca n't believe this place is still in business .

the tofu was soggy ( bleh ! )
tonight 's visit was unbelievably disgusting !
i dislike drinking from cups at restaurants .
then this is where it went south .
i 'm not joking .
not even edible , just disgusting .
sadly , it is not any longer .
egg drop soup is watery no flavor .
egg rolls are greasy and over fried .

this gym has become an absolute dump .
the place is an absolute tip in the evenings .

their service department ripped me off .
you ca n't be serious .

arrowhead and bell lexus is owned by same company .
worst new car sales experience ever .
glad there are choices for other lexus dealerships .
these people are not a group with much integrity .
warning , they are not trustworthy .
poor customer service and lots of attitude .

the plastic fork broke off in the first one .
they will be limited .
that 's what a job is !
sherry 's pampered pets should be shut down .
the first time i fell in love .

was rude and curt .
otherwise you are losing a customer .
he was not groomed .
ok , rant time !
great food , not so great barista knowledge .

spinatos disappointed me big time .
the toppings were very sparse and not that fresh .
ok , we 'll get pizza for saturday .
people , this is not good pizza .
the sauce was horrible !
it was sweet and my taste buds were confused .
it was very strange .
how difficult is it to chop some garlic ?
it barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza .
the caesar dressing was very fishy .
the pizza sauce was way too sweet .
this is bad policy .
( well at least it 's hot ) not .
just like the super _num_ i ordered .
i 'll try again but not right away .
came in hungry , left very hungry !
we waited _num_ minutes for cold food .
unfortunately , experience was complete ruined by this time .
in my opinion sauce should not taste like this .
tonight we ordered from the bell rd location .
unfortunately the pizza was awful .
it is pretty slow here .
spinato 's has lost my business forever .
an answering system says i 'm 3rd in line .
i totally understand that places get crazy busy .
no information or sorry they were closed .
for the price too , i expected more .
everybody said to go to heritage so i did .
their drinks were flat .
our burgers were thrown together and sloppy .
not so much a church as a huge theater .
no one really gets to know anyone .
this `` church '' is not for me .
because we were n't apart of the church .
leaving this church today , i feel extremely disappointed .
god spoke to me and told me to run !

i also purchased a groupon when they offered it .
no it does n't .
our property management company sent them out .
worst ac company in the whole valley !
do not use this company !
not a fan at all .
i threw it out after a few bites .

others just want a quick buck at your expense .
probably one of the worst experiences of my life !
avoid this place at all cost !
i would give negative stars if i could .
they also overcharge for teeth cleaning .
i would not recommend this vet .
now he is dead .

the hostess answering the phone was rude as well .

that was my budget lunch .
first visit was not that impressive .
i found this place to be pretty mediocre .

the pad thai was not as good .
the food is way too salty .
i had the shrimp salad and it was horrible .
but the guy was like well that 's illegal !
the thai soup staple .
like , how can you make terrible tom yum ?
mushy ( as in possibly spoiled ) shrimp .

nothing was even slightly spicy .
all sweet , no heat .
the tom yum soup is not tom yum .
i myself do not mind spicy foods .
very disappointing to say the least .
worst customer service and follow-up appointment .

i would suggest that nobody goes there .

the only plus here is the drinks !
this place is gross .
there is nothing fresh about this mexican grill .
the food is mostly tasteless and sloppy .
my daughter and i left without finishing our food .
one bonus star for not getting sick from anything .
i ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was blech !
nothing good about that thing .
how can a eatery get mexican food so wrong ?
the chicken was bland .
i would never advise this place .
i hate to be mean .
this place was hard to find anything good .
the service was really terrible .
only the quesadilla was edible .
all the food is watery & lacking real flavor .
even the salsa is pretty crappy .
she spoke in a condescending rude tone .
avoid this place like the plague .
unsatisfied & will not be returning .
no it is n't !
went in for a trim and thin .
my bbq beans were alright , nothing special .
the place was empty .
it was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty .
not at all like last time .
onion rings were ok meh nothing to write about .
the rib tips were cold inside .
this place was so disappointing .
i will not be coming back .
came here with friends to satisfy a bbq craving .
i had to pour on bbq sauce .
i had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile .
that was a mistake .
it ran just under $ _num_ .

i personally will not be going back .
everything was no good .
the meat was dry the sides were bland .
in summary , do n't go here .

here is your warning .
chow mein was watery and tasteless .
if want a list of place to stay away .

could have used more sauce and veggies .
not impressed at all .
i will not be ordering from them again .
the fried rice was sad .
no flavor even tho it was fried .
the wontons were seriously over cooked .
the orange chicken was also lacking .
fried rice was undercooked .

i sent text messages and i left messages .
i am loyal to fault .
do n't waste your time with these guys .
was very disappointed with their service .

i can not recommend them .
very inconsistent food and service .

very very disappointed in this place .

burnt and cold , wth ?
zero stars would have been except able !
do not take your pet to this place !
the owners of the other dogs were not notified .
this place does not care about your pet .
sketchy doggie day care .
do not trust your beloved pet to this place !
are you kidding me ?
so my sample was thrown away .
the doctor pushed pills .
last week i called to schedule an appointment .
will never go here again !
i 've never been so insulted .
and i 'm not even a difficult client .
but i 'm none of that .
that 's just lazy !
today , they lost a customer and a fan .
very disappointed with the pedicure i received .
people in phoenix must have pretty low standards .
she was just awful !
i was so offended !
i left and my nails looked horrible .
i 'm never going here again !
as was the case tonight .
it says something very negative about the organization .
they still got it wrong .
wish dq could get their act together .
a disappointment on every level .
i would not recommend .
the girls are ok but the staff is awful .
low class , all around .
that was not the case .
the installers were nice enough but barely spoke english .
they said that jenny never comes to the jobs .
no one addressed the problems .
no one followed through .
i would not use them again .
this subway is the absolute worst !
the staff of this place is so strange .
we should n't have to pay for this garbage !
so why am i so incredibly angry right now ?
no , that 's not good customer service .
garbage every single time !
because there 's no proof they messed up .
i was n't sure why they were ignoring me .
( normally that is all i get ) .
and i drove my car out .
he would let me have a $ _num_ coupon .
customer service is not at all what it was !
to the negative experience ... .
i 'm not done yet .
i hate this place !
maybe even a little cheap .
very disappointed ordered _num_ sandwiches and two soups .
this place is really down .
it all falls on ownership .
so very very wrong .
it better prove useful .
smell something fishy yet ?
if i could put no stars i would .
ok are these brake pads made of gold ?
big o , big no !
approach with caution ... you have been warned !
there is nothing i consider redeeming by this place .
the flavor was good but just too much .
we listened to _num_ karaoke songs and nothing .
by far the worst way to start off .
after _num_ mins no beers , no chips .
of course she did not write it down .
i guess that 's a pet peeve of mine .
stay away from this poorly run company !
rude , unprofessional salesperson !
despite his initial rudeness , i invited him in .
i talked to the manager joey .
if i could give them no stars i would .
i would not recommend them at all .
i drove off and the ac did not work !
there goes $ _num_ down the drain !
if i could give negative stars i would !
instead it was take to there yard .
are you kidding me ?
would not ever use these jerks .
the water was cold .
all in all i 'm never going back there .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i will never return to this place .
you 've been warned .
that 's all folks !
not a single nail looks professional .
but my moms are completely ruined .
cashiers dont know how to count .
the chimichanga was pathetic , too .
that 's for a $ _num_ chimi .
the first half of it tasted like all beans .
i wo n't go back .
they said sure no problem and that was it .
in line for gas !
spent _num_ two weeks ago to fix my charger .
a week later it 's broke down again .
money runs this shop not honesty !
this one is barely acceptable .
i 'm not coming back .
avoid this place and just go to subway .
you 'll get a better sandwich without the attitude .
in short , they stole $ _num_ from me .
this place is awful .
i told her to forget it and walked out .
obviously this place does n't need business !
no , really , i want them shorter .
they said no wait and sat us down immediately .
i ultimately did not get the pedicure .
it was a little uncomfortable .
the one nail looks so horrible !
do n't waste your time or money !
terrible pedicure and terrible gel nails .
just want to say this place is filthy !
smells like sewage and cigarette smoke !
i got the worst gel manicure here last week .
she did n't even wrap them first .
i do n't even know how that is possible .
it was so bad .
also , they were rushing like crazy .
additionally , they have no options for designs .
i tipped much less than i normally would 've .
it was literally that bad !
stay away from this awful place !
will not be going back .
trust me is not worth the money you pay !
my manicure was awful !
very poor customer service and unprofessional !
i will not go back !

if i could give zero stars i would .
their customer service is awful .
reservations mean nothing and sunny is horrible .
it hurt and burned , but i said nothing .
i do n't like this place anymore .
i 'm now going elsewhere .
also the smell of chemicals was overpowering .
petsmart is the worst place to take your dog .
do you really trust your dogs with these employees ?
the dog grooming is even worse .
do n't use the grooming service .
terrible experience for my dog .
my dog has been using petsmart for everything .
the little dog was screaming in pain and terrified !
shame on you petsmart !
the grooming services here are not good .
i was there in september and never again !
after _num_ hours our dog was still not ready .
do not take your pets to banfield !
i finally snapped this photo because i was bored .
truth be told , no honest person does .
there is none . ''
i hate to be a dick .
it was a black hole in the parking lot .
she was very snotty when telling me this .
so when i get my food everything is wrong .
they gave me the crunch wrap .
just waiting for my contract to end .
this particular panda express is so gross ... .
if i could give negative stars , i would .
i walked out of the store .
once again , he did n't look at it .
i blew it off .
there is a really rude sales lady here .
she 's terrible '' .
all the other employees were very helpful .
will not go back to this location .
they however try to sell broken toys .

after that move , i was done .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
we then set up appointments for alterations .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars .
this was not great information or service .
i left feeling unimpressed .

i 'm glad to see it 's being renovated .
same goes for this walmart .
the employees are not interested in helping customers .
overall , it could be a lot better .

i noticed him staring at me .
it was just a very uncomfortable experience .
they do n't listen and over charge !

this place is mediocre at best .
the wings alone are _num_ even .

but the turkish coffee was a disaster .
unfortunately , i am usually disappointed .
the entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki .

service could of been better and prices lower .
disappointed after reading pretty decent reviews on this place .

food is great , but customer service is horrible .
customer service could be so much better .
they have wasted my time for the last time .
the staff is rude and inattentive .

there 's _num_ hilton properties surrounding the phoenix airport .
not what i expect and highly disappointed .
_num_ ) it is in the middle of nowhere .
the two hotel restaurants have very limited menus .
_num_ ) the room is old .
but i would n't stay there again .
she returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries .
i pointed out that my fries were cold .
i 'm sorry . ''
did i mention that the doors here are noisy .
no i will not stay here again !
internet service is crap .
do n't need reliable wi-fi ?
hotel is not bad beyond that .
you can hear the people talk next door .
$ _num_ of gross !
not ordering from this location ever again .
they see me walk in so they come inside .
i did not see them wash their hands .
lady who took my order reeked of cigarette smoke .
the combo meal was close to $ _num_ .
there was not much meat on the bread .
too many other sub places to choose from .
for one , the parking is awful .
she was n't impatient , just listed the sandwiches .
very skimpy on the meat and cheese portions .
not worth the money , not going back .
i am not usually one to complain .
this place is garbage .
lemonade was not lemonade , just water .
things get broken and never fixed .
a complete waste of time .
not a good look for the area .
this is the worst apartment we ever lived in !
the hot tub never worked .
there are several things wrong with this complex .
just below average apartments .
i would highly recommend elsewhere .
the tires were reasonably priced but short lived .
worst airline i have ever experienced .
one word -- nightmare !
like i said -- nightmare !
i have never experienced anything like it before !
no chairs to sit in to watch tv .
the noise from the airport wasnt to bad .
but the train noise is just unbearable .
that was a horrible experience !
there 's barely any cable channels on air !
my daughter , i and two cats came here .
wow i wish i could give this _num_ stars .
basically you get what you pay for ... .
absolutely the most incompetent staff works at this location .
i 'm never staying at that dump again .
it is very noisy .
there is no shampoo no hair dryer .
loud long and irritating .
uncomfortable beds felt like laying on rubber sheets .
the machaca always struck me as bland .
and the hours are frustrating .
lacking any real taste to it whatsoever .
they will knock your socks off !
it 's a disgrace .
this is n't really mexican food .
seriously , it 's appalling .
so would i eat there again ?
no chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam !
awful , awful , awful !
i ordered the beef enchilada platter .
the food is n't especially memorable .
but i just do n't get the hype !
yep , sketchy and a little ghetto i thought .
my sister 's enchiladas were n't too bad .
unfortunately i was disappointed .
but it is not worth any kind of drive .
the chicken soft tacos were ok .
the cheese enchilada was awful .
i wouldnt go out of my way for these .
so , that was a little deceiving .
so once again , i ordered the wrong thing .
the original was tasteless ( for obvious reasons ) .
the machaca breakfast burrito was pure mush .
very very very bad !
she could n't find my order .
nothing to write home about .
the food here was cheap and awful .
the restaurant itself is poorly kept and uncomfortable .
i would not recommend this food to anyone .
the meal just was n't very good .
you really ca n't beat the prices here .
had the worst experience on friday .
good food - horrible service .
i was really disappointed .
the taco was soggy from the tasteless enchilada sauce .
i will not be going back .
i was n't impressed by either .
i wo n't be going back .
went here on my way back from the airport .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
_num_ years and still have n't found one ... .
they were just awful .
the meat was dry and had no flavor .
the masa was even dry .
in this case , it was so bad .
the salsa was n't very good either .
now i remember why i had n't gone back .
will not be returning .
not good or consistent from visit to visit .
register girls have no personality by the way .
corn muffin was dry .
$ _num_ for a dozen buffalo wings ?
what the hell are you guys thinking ?
ass drops was more like it .
i mean , horrible .
i ca n't even describe the taste .
the food was pretty terrible overall .
it tasted of celery , if anything at all .
now that is some sad chinese food .
cheap yes , but not good .
the waitress was a complete jerk as well .
not worth $ _num_ .
felt like they gave me reheated food .
inside is not that clean and is jam packed .
yep got this one completely wrong .
the place is an absolute dump .
you would be better off eating your own hand .
it 's brown colored flavorless rice .
nothing more , nothing less .
everything was bland and coated in oil .
way too much oil .
these are not crab puffs .
greasy , bland cream cheese wontons .
i only ate two .
the rest went into the trash .
soooo , thanks for the let down yelpers .
is this place permanently closed ?
clean taxi but these people are unreliable .
this was a huge headache .
at 6:30 , however , no cab arrived .
can i give these guys zero stars ?
the driver ripped me off !
it sure wo n't be yellow cab .
would not recommend to anyone .
that cab driver was nice though .
so i do n't blame the driver .
is there less than a one star ?
worst cab experiences ever !
first cab driver got horribly lost .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
what a disturbing and unpleasant experience !
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
its not like its sunday morning , its wednesday !
she apologized and said it would be ten minutes .
i could have walked there by now !
never using yellow cab again .
we called _num_ hrs before we needed a pickup .
if you have no cabs you tell the customer .
that was a bit annoying .
f & ( $ you .
needless to say these guys are horrible .
two things wrong with this .
i hang up because i 'm tired of waiting .
avoid at all costs .
i would rather take the bus next time .
terrible , disgusting , the worst cab company !
and the drivers refuse to acknowledge it .
they are never polite and courteous .
`` ... i was shocked and disgusted .
this is just unacceptable and very very unprofessional .
well at 5:30 no cab .
he gave me names and a number to complain .
shame on this company !
gave my cash tip and went on my way .
is no stars an option ?
worst cab ride ever .
i wish i could give them negative stars .
they deserve a zero !
she told me the taxi would be _num_ minutes .
do not ever take yellow cab .
they are so inappropriate and dirty .
he would not admit his wrong doing .
his car was disgusting .
it is disgusting how they just do n't care .
worst cab service ever .
please someone just put them out of service already .
i really tried so very hard to like you .
he asks which apartment i 'm in .
`` why not $ _num_ ? ''
as we got off the _num_ at scottsdale rd .
this company does n't deserve even zero star .
horrible rude snotty phone dispatch .
using them is n't a convenience for you .
will not take a cab again .
this can company is terrible !
do n't waste your time .
_num_ mins later i called ... .
no problem , they 'll be there .
_num_ mins later i called a different cab company .

none of the mechanics at magic auto are certified .
shady mechanic telling me one thing and doing another .

what the hell is this ?
i feel like im in a school cafeteria !
i dont even buy this crap in grocery stores !

well , it was bad .
glad i did n't purchase from here .
but the service is extremely lacking .
it was just so weird .
the staff was not helpful , at all !
the woman was very rude and unhelpful .
i would not return to azteca .
it was not good .
as a bride , i would not come here .
that 's when things got worse .
this store was a disappointment .
what a waste of dresses .
i just had the worst experience at this store .
do not step foot in here .
they lack organization and have terrible communication .
i would save yourself a headache and go elsewhere .
i give this bridal salon _num_ stars .
i had no privacy and no help .
there was no other option .
worst customer service & experience .
the owners were rushing our girl to hurry up .
cheap prices for cheap service .
i 'd rather pay double the price elsewhere .
all i can say was she was african american .
horrible experience for a 1st time bride !
and all style sizes available were _num_ and lower .
we seriously wasted our time here .
the staff have no idea what they 're doing .
first off , the parking situation is ridiculous .
this was not great .
the meat is very hard .
twenty minutes for _num_ tacos ?
avoid this motel at all possible cost .
i tried to lock my car .
i will not recommend this place .
the garlic toast was not really garlic toast .
the mashed potatoes were even worse .
i 've already mentioned the terrible side dishes .
for low quality food , those prices are unacceptable .
i guess people in arizona like this garbage .
potato salad not good at all .
beans not good at all .
expensive and horrible food .
i was not impressed with the sauce .
im use to sliced beef instead of shredded .
ribs : now the ribs i can get behind .
however , i should n't have .
the mashed potatoes were not good either .
i did not care for the bbq sauce .
i do not recommend this restaurant .
the ribs are crap .
the soda is watered down .
no lettuce no tomato .
it seems like the problems are always after _num_ .
i ordered the chicken n ribs dinner .
i chose coleslaw and garlic toast .
overall experience was just ok .
the chicken was also ok .
i would n't go there again .
so disgusted by the female owner .
lady your everything wrong with america .
there may have been one salad option , too .
i was pissed off .
or renting a car in phoenix period .
how about an suv - no thanks .
i never want to use budget there again .
it was about _num_ miles more .
check-in , however , was ridiculous .
the worst experience i had for car rental ever .
i do n't know who is the stupid guy .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
i would n't put my worst enemy through that .
it does n't matter that you have a coupon .
our number was _num_ .
nothing at this agency was clearly explained .
shame on you budget !
remember , there are many car rental choices available .
i 'm giving budget one star already .
horrible waits , bad service .
zero stars for this place .
then i called from st louis where we landed .
too many other choices .
that is the same amount as my car note .
quite curt , if not rude , employees .
i wish i 'd checked yelp before i booked .
_num_ hours after arriving at phx .
i wanted to like budget , i really did .
sorry , you lost me with this one .
believe me , there was no stains !
rented a car over thanksgiving .
they can not be trusted .
given ticket for _num_ min wait .
absolutely ridiculous must have over booked themselves .
my number was _num_ and they were on _num_ .
worst customer service i have ever received .
this agency is a rip off !
impossible to reach by phone .
very terrible experience with this company .
people with just reservations were screwed !
she was just horrendous .
save yourself the frustration and rent elsewhere !
the car sucks , their corporate phone system sucks .
terrible customer service and overpriced service .
a reservation apparently is not a real reservation here .
i would give zero stars if i could .
ridiculous service on a friday .
they were on number _num_ .
ridiculously long line and wait at phoenix airport !
do not recommend this location .
i have _num_ chances to budget .
we will not use this outfit again .
it 's off the charts ridiculous .
the worst service i have ever seen !
seriously budget get your act together !
_num_ hours and counting !
surrounded by a room full of angry customers .
worse car rental place .
happens every time i am here for spring training .
other people waiting , have costco car reservations also .
there are _num_ people in front of me .
no discount offered for the inconvenience .
went to national and was helped in _num_ min .
worst experience i ever had at a car rental .

blame everyone but budget phoenix time and people management .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
customer service of no use after the fact .
well guess what no one showed .
pretentious and condescending writing .
it 's time to stop playing high school newspaper .
to which he responded again with another insult .
what a waste of trees .
those books ... er , never mind ) .
maybe , but i will only order the fish .
my dad had fried okra and fried zucchini .
sorry , but we wo n't be back .
but this place is just awful .
the cocktail sauce is way too spicy and watery .
my advice , skip this place if you can !
the shrimp had too much batter .
this is not it folks .
do n't do this to yourself .
you 'll be better off .
there is no other explanation .
fish and chips was very bland .
it seemed fresh , just lacking .
the fries were disappointing too .
probably wo n't be back .
i 'm sorry , what ?
this place was the worst !
the food is horrible !
fries were soggy and bland .
cocktail sauce was even bland .
where is the negative _num_ stars button ?
and ppl thought pete 's was bad ?
ate here on a friday night with a friend .
the fries could have been better .
to me it just came across as grumpy management .
these people where not very nice .
this place was horrible !
do n't waist you 're time or money .
go elsewhere for seafood .
they never smell fishy , though .
they came out dry and the meat was stiff .
worst fish and chips i 've ever had .
no real seasoning to the okra breading .
she did really like the fish though .
that was the slightly redeeming factor .
is half the size it used to be .
fish is too thick for batter .
went in for lunch on june 2nd .
both toilets full of crap .
did not look like the sullivan family to me .
part _num_ : customer service was awful .
do i recommend no .
it was a bunch of the most random junk .
only good on fridays .
( should have been a red flag ) .
did a great job and could n't be happier .
these people strike me as extremely lazy !
they did very lousy work , poor craftsmanship .
this was slightly better , but not by far .
to boot , the item looked really crappy .
looked like it had never been cleaned .
i 'm not holding my breathe !
i 'm pretty sure they lost it .
save your money and stay away from this place !
the work is shoddy at best .
horrible horrible horrible company .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
horrible company , horrible customer service ... .
there 's just one big bus to hop onto .
ok , end rant .
i hate taking buses between terminals .
i do n't really want to be here either .
when i travel , i tend to have things .
yeah , this place is hell alright .
only americans would know that .
sky harbor is like any other airport .
i wish i had run him over .
if i die , i die .
this is where terminal _num_ shines .
not much to see here , really .
then they lost interest with me .
it is dull and boring .
after that , it 's downhill .
it is n't rocket science .
the terminals are not user friendly .
almost as bad as oakland .
people are freaking rude .
bus service between terminals slow .
the gates themselves are old and run down .
and the north curb and south curb ?
also , the security is slow .
i 'm not done !
had a layover here ... _num_ hours !
did not enjoy it .
bathroom floors are sooo sticky and dirty .
being stuck in terminal _num_ is an awful experience .
does n't seem like a big deal ?
they 're _num_ miles apart .
okay , not really .
most of the problems are caused by the layout .
c concourse has no internet signal .
old , smells , and not enough signs .
not a huge deal , right ?
zero signs that tell you where to go .
thats fucking pathetic and sad .
the walk is only about _num_ yards .
do not order food in this place .
the restaurant selections are limited .
i 've never flown out of sky harbor .
so why only two stars ?
the waits for baggage are unacceptable .
better plan on a long wait there too .
my worst time was _num_ mins .
not so much a fan of this airport .
the furniture and dcor need some serious updating .
what outlets we could find were dead , too .
thats it in my terminal worth mentioning .
bathroom doors do n't lock .
hate getting stuck here when i need to eat .
not the worst airport and not the best .
signage : poor to non existent .
years and years of poor planning .
i have never been to a more ridiculous airport .
i will avoid flying here in the future .
whether i 'm on time , late or early .
sky harbor , you lose .
do not collect $ _num_ .
no cookie for you .
poor service and so so food .
parking is a nightmare .
especially when you have to reach terminal _num_ .
obviously , i do n't enjoy coming here .
plus , i have no other choice .
unless i buy my own jet .
atmosphere : clean facilities but nothing spectacular .
phoenix , phoenix , phoenix .
you sure worked hard to make me dislike you .
but flying out of phoenix .
it turned out he gave me the wrong directions .
sky harbor needs a closed airport layout .
never again sky harbor !
nothing special to get excited about .
and then , they managed to lose our luggage .
renting a car here is ridiculous .
i 'm not joking .
worst international airport in the united states .
worst airport in america for efficiency .
( it is set up like a giant u .
in short , this airport stinks .
a mandatory walk across the airport is not good .
that carpet will not let you roll yours easily .
why is it the worst you ask ?
nothing special or awesome but no real complaints .
there is nothing simple about this airport .
employees are not helpful .
i hate this airport .
i wouldnt want my worst enemy going in there .
will never , ever rent from them again .
i hate these people .
so i do n't like it here .
- there is absolutely no good food options .
- everything is just so plain and boring .
the walls are a nasty sandy color .
- toilets are complete crap .
that 's just disgusting .
police guys did n't show up for _num_ minutes .
a crappy eatery here and there .
another tsa agent directed me where to go .
yeah , i could n't believe it either .
do n't fly through phoenix .
bad , bad experience .
_num_ where are the seats ?
no more , those days are long behind me .
all told , phx is neither bad nor impressive .
the restrooms are ok but usually crowded .
adding wi-fi , some better restaurants , etc .
picking up and dropping off people is a nightmare .
it is insanely frustrating .
the layout of terminal _num_ is frustrating .
the whole airports needs an overhaul .
services offered while waiting for your next flight ?
do n't do it if the gate is packed .
one star because zero is n't an option .
then there 's the restrooms .
the terminals feel drab and dingy .
that 's what sky harbor feels like .
this airport really sucks .
the layout for one is ridiculous .
also they have a complete lack of power outlets !
standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus .
even oakland upgraded ... get with it phoenix !
yup , just about what i expected from phoenix .
it was just ridiculous .
but here it was even worse .
even the club closes relatively early .
most confusing airport ever !
just very poor signage .
not a horrible place , but certainly not good .
this i can not understand .
either requires a bus trip .
that is a big pet peeve of mine .
that is enough reason not to fly here .
old , ugly , worn out , and dirty .
driving into phoenix would be much better .
this time it was on the southwest side !
the airport is also confusing .
worst customer service experience ive ever had .
when i get there _num_ people are in line .
_num_ ) got on next flight and left .
my recent experience at phoenix was n't the greatest .
terminal b is just horrendous .
i hate this airport , friendliest my ass !
on-site rentals would be nice , but not here .
not friendly at all .
lack of power outlets .
my boyfriend and i recently had a layover here .
dave goes to new mexico part _num_ .
there was no place to buy sunglasses inside security .
i hope i never had a layover here again .
avoid if at all possible .
hopefully we will not cross paths again .
i 'm just not a fan of this place .
i do not like to wait in line .
i do not like the extra fees .
i do not like the extreme crowds .
the wait to pay is oh so slow .
i do not like this traffic jam .
went straight to security and barely made my flight .
ca n't wait to leave !
i 've never gone through security here before .
they only looked at my boarding pass .
somehow that is not comforting to me .
it 's just weird .
the airport itself also was n't an interesting site .
just an airport like lax .
do n't even want to give one star .
one of my least favorite airports .
it seems like forever to get to the gate .
this airport is bad .
i just hate this place .
meh , it 's functional i guess .
seriously they were super rude to me !
so when i left hawaii everything was cool .
it was super easy and not a big deal .
and there was nothing inside the terminal .
terrible airline operations , incompetent tsa .
all things that this airport lacks .
try to avoid this place if you can .
the employees here are extremely rude !
awful place to have a layover .
avoid this airport or terminal if possible .
why does it smell like that ?
terminal _num_ is absolutely the worst terminal ever .
and there are no places to eat pre security .
dont fly out of this terminal .
there 's no getting around it .
its poorly lit and feels `` sweaty . ''
us airways customer service is terrible !
the rep was rude and a little snotty .
everything is marked and the layout is horrible .
the food court is pretty gross , still .
no one could believe it .
unacceptable and completely ridiculous .
glad they have an information desk .
i hate this airport !
i hate this airport .
this airport is garbage on so many levels .
not just you , like your whole plane full .
seriously , many phx folks drive to tucson .
i have severe allergies to pets .
shame on you , phoenix !
i 've been to better county airports .
_num_ , than _num_ , than back to one .
not a fan of this airport for one reason .
there are very few ways to charge anything .
lots of chairs but no outlets .
first , it 's been remodeled .
i really could have used a starbucks .
this airport is horrible .
not a fan of this airport .
not a great airport .
would n't necessarily recommend .
i 'm not a fan of this one !
tsa checks were not the best .
the lines were slow .
hotel was only ten minutes away .
lack of charging stations is a definite bummer .
it 's just an old dingy , sticky airport .
it just needs some tlc to bring it back .
the d terminal is only one arm .
the hidden taxes and fees are ridiculous .
will not be renting from them again .
my least favorite airport when flying east .
worst airport for baggage claim .
not a great airport .
i try to avoid this airport when possible .
what a piece of crap air port !
this airport is absolutely ridiculous !
perhaps the worst airport in north america .
the tsa people were terribly inefficient and somewhat rude .
all very hospitable folk , no doubt .
i never thought of that ! '' )
one of the worst major airports .
tsa is set up in hallways .
you ca n't get from terminal to terminal .
not enough seating in terminal area .
one of the worst major airports .
tsa is set up in hallways .
you ca n't get from terminal to terminal .
not enough seating in terminal area .
it is too bad really .
also , the mens restrooms were poorly designed .
i am so disappointed in this airport .
do n't check bags to this airport .
you pay _num_ bucks to wait .
security check point is also slow .
this is the worst airport .
the air conditioner is not on .
this airport is terrible .
so , no choice but to walk .
i wish i had caught his name .
he was a miserable person with no people skills .
my least favorite airport .
terminal _num_ is by far the least comfortable .
i dread entering phx .
worst airport i have even been to .
its not that hard .
the worst customer service i have ever seen .
well that 's just too bad !
later , and now _num_ mins .
horribly designed airport ; terminals are all spread out .
worst airport experience ever .
sky harbor rates low with this seasoned traveler .
the _num_ stars are for terminal _num_ only .
terminal _num_ is a totally different story .
but you ca n't get on .
why ca n't wifi be easier at us airports .
frankly - one of the worst airports in america .
terrible transportation between terminals .
not enough restrooms or restaurants .
if i could avoid it i would .
quite possibly this is the worst in the country .
bathrooms at this airport are few and far between .
crowded , busy , and uncomfortable .
there could be better food choices .
until i flew out of phoenix sky harbor .
not my favorite airport .
there 's not an outlet to be found anywhere .
no free wifi either .
big low score for tsa .
returning a rental car is the worst .
unbelievably inept tsa staff !
they deserve a minus star rating .
due to the long wait we missed our flight !
omg , this is one the worse airport .
airport itself is very old old old .
it 's _num_ pm at night !
not very excited about coming back here .
tsa at terminal c here was ridiculously bad .
pretty pathetic flying out of here .
terminal _num_ security grossly understaffed .
1/2 hour to get through is ridiculous .
open _num_ hours , ha !
but seriously , when there 's nothing even open ?
should i eat my money ?
this airport is the pits .
the employees here are n't very friendly either .
one hour wait through security .
someone is not doing their job !
just try not to ever rent a car here !
worst i 've seen in the country .
just awful we 're expected to stand and wait .
no thank you phx .
yesterday at the phoenix airport was the worst .
do n't expect any great eateries .
no one working and things moving real slow .
probably _num_ different airports .
this is by far the worst .
shut this airport and build one somewhere else .
it was a nightmare .
inside , was worse .
it was worse than the worst disneyland line .
worst airport in the world in my humble opinion .
only negative is the security .
it was ridiculously understaffed and took nearly two hours .
least impressive to me was the food selection .
lack of options makes for one cranky traveler .
meh , i do n't love this airport .
every tsa agent here should be fired .
rental bus drivers worst in the nation .
tsa lines here are ridiculous .
nothing impressive at all .
horrible , horrible , horrible experience .
everything was under construction and signs were very bad .
wrong , wrong wrong .
not even a tissue ! ''
i get anxiety just thinking about it .
the dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly .
none of my calls were returned .
do not support this organization !
what a disgusting and uncaring organization !
so , she was given a sick kitten !
that is not allowed .
very disappointed with our experience with this shelter .
it 's only _num_ bucks or something like that .
very easy to miss .
the shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable .
no apology to me for his behavior .
i could n't believe it .
i 'm very unsatisfied .
this place is below par .
literally - falling down in places .
cheap but that 's it .
the car was there for less than _num_ hours .
this `` fuel and service charge '' is ridiculous .
the coupon says $ _num_ per day .
said nothing about additional fees may apply .
not even close in fact .
this is no longer my spot .
the service has gotten absolutely terrible .
this mornings experience was horrible .
never returning back to this dump !
the way back to the car was a disaster .
pay the little extra and get better service .
the parking lot is run down and disgusting .
we will not use this one again .
beware of letting drivers handle your luggage for you .
my bags are `` my responsibility . ''
i have used this service several times .
tool _num_ minutes to get picked up at _num_ .
so not worth it .
wow , what a horrible experience .
a horrible night of sleep .
anyway , that 's another review .
the most bland prime i 've ever had .
no water , no bread , pathetic service .
i left an _num_ % tip .
this should never happen at any high end restaurant .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i just was n't impressed .
apparently restaurant week offended our waiter ?
( extra $ _num_ , really ? )
my girlfriend and i ate here in _num_ .
it 's totally not .
it was literally just shredded up dry cabbage !
so ... yeah , did n't eat the slaw .
i would n't do dinner again .
got there about 5:30 left at 7:00 .
remembering last years visit we were disappointed .
cut into this one and again barely warm .
simply stated , i 'll never return .
the bread basket contained biscuits and jalapeno corn bread .
can you understand why i 'm pissed off ?
had the worse experience at this rest .
our server was rude and arrogant .
the worse service i have ever experienced .
filet med with a little pink in the middle .
i said no it is not .
did not even offer me another filet .
i ca n't believe that she did not comp .
our party of _num_ went elsewhere .
not horrible but would never recommend or return .
do n't waste your time !
the steaks are n't hot .
the veggies are n't fresh .
yikes , bad call .
it was just ok .
the place was just average but at top prices .
i will not be back .
and zero stars for service !
we left ten percent on a $ _num_ bill .
otherwise i think your money is better spent elsewhere .
sides also were unimpressive .
she did not finish the liver .
worst service i 've ever received !
there was no char or flavor to the steak .
buffalo meatloaf : no texture , bad flavor .
it 's extremely mushy .
potato stack : these are n't bad .
a little mushy , but not bad .
however , their bacon is like dust .
trying to book _num_ days of parking .
very poor business practice .
i 'm rating only their parking service .
the leaves were not completely picked up either .
well that was _num_ days ago .
called and got an answering machine .
i will never use this shuttle .
lousy information , lousy communication , lousy customer service .
why ca n't you have a sign ?
disappointed they have stopped providing water .
simply a waste of time , and money .
i do n't recommend at all .
it was n't bad it just was nothing special .
the decor is very _num_ 's and never updated .
the menus have been dirty on occasion .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
actually , it 's kind of bland .
again , very poor value .
lastly , never get the coleslaw .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
$ - _num_ star out of _num_ .
spend your money elsewhere .
i almost just got cold stone for breakfast .
the burrito was surprisingly small .
like most airport restaurants , it looks clean .
edible , but nothing to write home about .
beats burger king any day .
it 's almost impossible to ruin that ... almost .
i am still sick to my stomach .
they never apologized and never offered for any help .
worst customer service ever .
customer service was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
the customer service at sky harbor airport is poor .
this place is not very good .
at best probably _num_ minutes old .
all a bunch of confusion to make more money .
rude to the max .
that is not how you do business .
business _num_ - never be rude to the customer .
being nice goes a long way .
worst rental car experience i 've ever had .
the car was pretty dirty and smelly .
this is a new company to me .
there 's a reason this company gets _num_ stars .
they were too busy trying to upsell .
good for their business , bad for customers .
problems checking car back in on return .
will never rent again .
nothing really stood out for me except the prices .
my flight was _num_ minutes long .
there were _num_ people at the counters .
avoid at all costs !
this was my first time renting from advantage .
i do n't think i 'll do it again .
but id rather pay a little extra for convenience .
worst experience renting a car i 've ever had !
first as a student .
financial aid is a nightmare at this campus .
they will lie to you and waste your time .
they could n't understand that .
this place is not military friendly .
it should not work that way .
not worth the $ _num_ for the ten minutes .
they were good when they were gas carts .
i was excited to try this place out .
place is extremely boring .
did i mention how expensive it is ?
they do n't care !
it was over in about _num_ minutes .
there are n't any fans or anything at all .
would n't be a place i would recommend !
this is no different .
price difference $ _num_ .
old salad and rude service .
unfortunately i didnt like it .
the breading covering the fish was like bird food .
the service was bad .
fries were not salted and were tasteless .
i wo n't be back .
slow services , mediocre value and dull flavors .
cooked just right & crunchy as expected .
the fries were limp & flavorless .
not impressed at all .
they told me _num_ mins .
the facility lacked adequate security .
my latest experience : it was horrible .
there always trash on the bus its disgusting .
the buses are filthy , but it 's cheap .
am i missing something ?
no one there smiles but one security guard .
the rest looked liked they hated there job !
i 'd give them zero stars if possible .
one star is entirely too many !
did n't i pay for this wifi ?
seriously difficult to deal with these people .
knew it would be a mistake taking greyhound again .
this trip i was simply trying to save money .
customer service is not anything greyhound cares for .
this has been a horrid experience .
if i could give zero stars i would .
do not use greyhound !
not even as last resort .
avoid greyhound if you can .
we will never use greyhound again .
this is not the first time either .
rude staff and disgusting bus .
i feel dirty from even walking on the bus .
the food was not good .
the food is mediocre .
the service , attitude and cleanliness are beyond poor .
i will not be visiting this waffle house again !
we got our food really spread out too .
mine was like half over done .
we would n't go to this one again .
_num_ star is too much .
maybe i came on a bad night .
greasy , low quality , disgusting food .
but what you get is pretty bad .
i left feeling full , but unsatisfied .
this waffle house appeared dirty down to the dishes .
it was pretty disgusting .
sadly i was mistake .
there hole staff is ghetto and trash .
they sell everything without tax and are overall thieves .
ten minutes later , i call again .
i was already _num_ minutes late !
the driver was not the issue .
he was on time , polite , and knowledgeable .
what happened after was worse .
the whole thing makes me sick .
two worst cab companies in phoenix az .
appointment with my primary care doctor last months too !
aaa transportation cabs & discount cabs totally !
this company is terrible .
i have not received a call .
not a sparkling review by any means .
it was cab _num_ .
he was pretty unfriendly and borderline rude .
he never offered any assistance for our baggage .
she was told _num_ min .
no one should ever have that much run around .
they told me _num_ minutes .
_num_ stars ... it was ok .
the decor was ... plain .
not if i did n't have to .
i will not stay here again .
worst example of customer service i 've seen .
no call , no email , no contact .
this has been an absolutely lousy experience .
too pricey for the kind of service they offer !
they have let this property get very tired .
sad because is a great location ?
extremely disappointed with this hotel .
stay away from room _num_ .
eh ... not sure .
i am truly disappointed in this place .
the work they do is downright embarrassing .
he is no longer my friend .
but my sandwich was just ok.
the wheat roll was hard and chewy .
there is a _num_ cent additional fee for cards .
_num_ weeks latter i get a email requesting payment .
_num_ weeks gone by and no service.
margarita the owner was not helpful to my needs !
lets just say it was ugly !
the worst acrylics i 've ever seen .
for the next _num_ days i was completely embarrassed !
i wo n't be going back .
overall , it was a really disappoint experience .
anyways , the soup was broccoli and cheese .
total was _num_ bucks .
the coffee is awful !
most importantly though , the service sucked .
skip this place and try something else at breakfast .
needless to say i will not be back !
not to mention it was not big at all .
a disgrace on the otherwise ok restaurant .
i took one bite and it all fell apart .
it was n't our fault .
the cashier repeated back , `` asian salad . ''
also ordered pick _num_ for my dining partner .
it was just chunks of fat and gristle .
so , so gross .
terrible , terrible service !
i do not recommend any travelers to eat here .
, probably not the place to go .
maybe i 'm just spoiled ... .
banana but muffin was good but undercooked .
paradise cafe was the only thing that seemed appetizing .
trust me , i looked multiple times .
paradise bakery in terminal _num_ c concourse is .
they made no effort to meet or exceed expectations .
they are n't even close to being ready .
awful service , unprofessional and unpleasant to experience .
she was extremely rude .
nope , no , nada !
i replaced my battery and left .
hello , ford motor co !
goodbye bell ford in phoenix , az .
overall waste of time .
this place is horrible .
they give you the run around fake promises .
do yourself a favor elsewhere for your ford !
do not give these guys your real phone number !
if they get your phone number you 're toast .
i walked out and never looked back .
very bad first impression for a loyal ford owner .
i would n't waste a second at bell ford .
ugh this service department makes me so mad .
please think twice before you waste your time here .
i will not buy from this dealership again .
strike _num_ , bell ford .
that lie should have been my first red flag .
( _num_ calls now over the past week ) .
each time i am promised a return call .
just had a horrible experience .
was passed off between _num_ sales reps during visit .
i know nothing about horse racing .
the beer was warm and the food was terrible .
terrible ... so sad !
do not use this company !
she made me not want to use this company .
so , i was a little upset .
this is the worst dental office ever .
and omg we both hated it !
the rides are kinda lame .
this place is poorly designed .
the park is old and needs to be redone .
the bathrooms are so disgusting its pathetic .
it should only cost five dollars for locals .
upon entering the arcade , i was immediately disappointed .
the people before me has that problem as well .
i probably wo n't go again .
not worth the price .
the day we went , several rides were closed .
$ _num_ for unlimited rides ?
also , the beverages are outrageously priced .
but as is it feels like a tourist trap .
are you kidding me ?
my kids even got bored !
not worth it at all .
the management deserves _num_ !
there were _num_ stools available in the arcade .
employees are rude and impatient .
apparently , they forgot to call me .
that 's not right . ''
wo n't make that mistake again .
but the service tech was given the wrong windshield .
and , this was n't it .
how is _num_ customer service a business model ?
gave me a _num_ hour window , missed it .
absolutely terrible and deceptive .
do n't believe all the hype .
what a complete and total waste of my time .
such an amateur mistake .
the list goes on .
she did n't give a link or anything .
go elsewhere for your kids ' activities .
i feel that is very inappropriate .
better luck with your driver !
yes , sir , like toppings and stuff .
half the pizza had no toppings at all .
so i joined him for lunch .
$ _num_ beer if you order lunch .
rent must be really really low .
which is why we gave it a try .
ok , but not quite that good .
the food is worth the money , nothing special .
it was like the black hole of coffee condiments .
nasty , nasty , nasty .
mediocre fast food , fine .
when i got my bag there was no ketchup !
_num_ mins in line .
_num_ minutes in the drive thru .
_num_ of those minutes after i paid .
fault of an un experienced employee cost me .
this seems very expensive as compared to a competitor .
they did not care to have my business .
they did n't really care though .
i used classic party rentals for my wedding .
absolutely the worst bouquet i 've ever bought .
our wedding was almost ruined though their complete incompetence .
pointing does n't tell me anything .
yeah , ok , i guess that works .
there is n't supposed to be .
not a bunch like she claimed .
also , she saw that i had no stereo .
my friend was installing it for me .
the people who work here know nothing about vehicles .
they have the worst customer service ever .
worst customer service ever .
thanks but no thanks .
they will no longer be getting our business .
so i drive from casa grande , az .
was a horrible experience .
my car rarely breaks down !
but we would be left paying the towing .
same thing happened to my dad .
it was really dirty .
the bbq pork was overcooked and tough .
the sauce was so-so .
this place is mediocre at best .
all in all nothing was really that tasty .
even the sweet tea was lacking .
it 's just that the food is not special .
the service fees are ridiculous .
if she does not qualify than no body should !
this company is the worst .
still waiting for a manger to call me back .
what i got was soggy chips under green chili .
i did n't notice until i got home .
my loss , because it 's permanently stained .
i refuse pay for anymore services from firestone !
i was frustrated and just left .
dont even waste your time or money !
( i was charged $ _num_ for this install .
so far not really a problem .
she just starts talking over me .
so i go ahead and give him a sample .
finally , she brings out the invoice .
that is pretty rude of you . ''
clearly he was annoyed with me , again .
very deceptive marketing practices and high pressure sales .
never even gave me the _num_ gift promised !
it 's not really `` mexican food '' .
returned half or food because it smelled so bad .
the food was mediocre .
we have mixed reviews , ourselves , though .
there are fish tanks with large fish in them .
there are no other meats .
otherwise , skip it .
they gave me cold mac and cheese .
very black peppery and not very many vegetables .
i did n't like it .
the total bill was $ _num_ .
enough food to feed _num_ people at least .
do not go here at all .
this place is disgusting .
gross , i will never eat there again .
that was n't the case today .
so , whatever , no problem .
the pizza hut does n't have a door .
there are _num_ groups already there ahead of me .
down to _num_ of us .
i will not order from this location again .
then you can avoid these types of problems .
pizza was never delivered .
i would give negative stars if i could .
when it finally arrived it was cold .
not even luke warm .
it 's a complete joke .
guess my money is n't green enough for them .
this has got to be the worst store ever .
horrible service and delivery times are out of control !
if i could give negative stars i would .
avoid this dump at all cost .
you 've been warned .
i said , `` no problem , i understand .
for me , it is all about first impressions .
the specialist called me and confirmed the appointment .
he was very knowledgeable and polite .
a week passed and no email .
finally , i get a call that evening .
they responded to my follow up emails within minutes .
run , do n't walk away from this company .
some excuse , we 're sorry , etc .
guess what , no call .
they were mostly minor - but failed inspection nonetheless .
the sales guy apparently cant add .
i approved , not having a better choice .
the tile from the bone yard was delivered .
there was no final inspection .
do not hire this company !
loose fruit and veggies - um , no .
i was so wrong .
this place is the worst .
they do n't even deserve one star .
horrible customer service with even worst employees .
do n't waste your time coming to this shake .
the worst customer service in the industry .
nothing else to say ... .
worst customer service ever !
i was so mad and asked to be refunded .
he looked at me like i just killed somebody .
clearly a speaker problem , not me .
this they could handle without a problem .
april _num_ : god damn you .
and my tacos were crammed with lettuce .
i had my order in under _num_ minutes .
tacos are now _num_ cents .
go next door to taco bell or whataburger .
supposed to be open at 8:00 am on weekends .
worst pharmacy , ever !
so my boyfriend was the first to report it ?
they can sometimes be overly soggy .
but the flavor was a bit off .
it was a bit runny and tasteless for me .
the people here have no sense of customer service .
the facility is old and the furnishings dated .
what a waste of money .
that was not a greek salad .
overwhelmed staff at lunch rush .
not given receipt or ketchup for my fries .
not much better than subway in my opinion .
no fresh brewed tea .
i do n't intend to go back .
great customer service , poor execution .
so , he did the measurements same day .
i could n't believe it .
friday was the only day it could be done .
do they only have _num_ technician ?
my suggestion is get estimates and use another company .
one of the worst companies i ever deal with .
worst customer service ever !
i wo n't be going back .
the lunch food for me has been consistently terrible .
however , he is supposed to cover this area .
do n't waste your time .
i would give zero stars if possible .
no name , just a number .
should have paid more for my pool fence .
customer service - horrible .
smoking and non-smoking rooms are on the same floor .
worst place i have ever stayed .
altogether i was very disappointed .
do n't stay here .
this place is awful .
nothing else ; no variety .
they are also hard to track down .
warning do not stay at this hotel !
it 's a horrible experience living here .
awful , so disgusting in all ways .
would never return if i did not have to .
but still , ugh !
do not stay at this location .
room was not cleaned on second day .
so then i went to bed .
miss , what are you looking at ? ''
however , i could not finish the burger .
there was so much grease .
i regret not going to in-n-out burger .
i do n't know how people eat here .
the hamburger itself was gray , tasteless .
the burger was greasy and flavorless .
worst whataburger i 've ever been .
cold tasteless food is what this place has .
sorry no second chances for this place .
this place is horrible .
apparently we were wrong .
this place is straight up creepy and run down .
avoid at all costs .
no it 's still open for business .
i spilled a beer all over myself .
i waited _num_ minutes .
can i get this beer removed ?
food sucked also as bad as the service .
the bulk of my complaints concern the bathroom .
well , skip this one .
did n't sleep at all .
disappointed for a hilton .
air is loud and noisy as well .
fire alarm at _num_ am .
workout facility is mediocre .
first room was noisy .
my husband and i just ate there .
that is no bread and a side salad instead .
the only vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich .
what a waste of a year !
every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces .
my kitchen table was unable to be repaired .
holy cow what a horrible experience !
the absolute last day of the _num_ week window .
this place is terrible !
they only exchanged it for another one .
i 've had nothing but bad luck !
too pricey for south phoenix .
how does that happen , subway !
ben advised no as i was getting cheap golf .
staff was like they did not want us there.
pro shop employees are rude .
which made me even more frustrated .
the course was good but the service was horrible .
because this was not good pizza .
but there was no flavor .
it sounds worse than that .
- i did n't have to cook .
quite simply , you get what you pay for .
both times i went the service was horribly slow .
the place felt hot and there were flies everywhere .
she insisted it worked .
very very very bad service !
these guys can not be trusted .
i do n't have high hopes .
the food was horrible .
my mother had heart failure .
this place is terrible !
since then everything has been very slow .
i would not recommend this place .
the staff are unprofessional and incompetent .
the place smells of urine and is not clean .
they do not wash their hands between patients .
if you do , you will regret it .
service was terrible and staff was very unfriendly !
tonight was our first time eating here .
sadly , the customer service has declined .
nothing good to say about this place .
no manager on duty tonight .
i will not be returning .
i 've had three bad experiences .
ok , my fault for not bargain shopping .
that fish could kill me !
cashier : `` no ! ''
cashier : `` no ! ''
i just ca n't steal points from safeway .
wait times in line are ridiculously long .
i 'm weary of this place.
breakfast was bacon , eggs , pancake .
the way this was handled upset me .
i had never met him before .
how else could he afford to drive nice vehicles ?
ordered pepperoni pizza and wings ( $ _num_ ) .
wings were fatty disgusting and soggy .
pizza was mediocre at best .
simply the worst pizza in the valley .
this is not one of them .
also , no air conditioning in phoenix in august .
i do n't know how this crust was made .
stopped in , no pizza ready .
told me it would be _num_ - _num_ minutes .
_num_ - _num_ minutes later , pizza is done .
get it home , no canadian bacon .
this place is horrible !
the pizza and wings were disgusting !
there was no flavor to the sauce .
they were not edible .
it was very expensive for such low quality !
the kids would not even eat it !
i was very disappointed with this place .
honestly , little caesar 's would have been better .
the employees i encountered barely speak english .
i was bumped _num_ times today .
there is some seating , but not much .
and then i stopped coming with my mom .
worst customer service ever !
so not worth it !
not worth paying _num_ dollars for .
also , our waitress was awful .
my beef tamale was awful .
i would not eat here again .
but this was horrible .
i tasted no cream cheese .
it tasted like sour cream with chunks of jalepeno .
even the jalepeno did n't taste like jalepeno !
the chicken was flavorless .
i could n't tell there was chicken in it .
no sides , no toppings , just orange goo .
the beef taco was horrible .
i wo n't be back .
wish yelp allowed negative stars .
ok food but horrible service .
we left a little disappointed .
all very salty to me .
i was was so excited to have lunch there .
maybe they should warn you about the onions !
the only thing i liked was the chips !
went for lunch with _num_ of the girls .
none of the food was seasoned .
my third bad experience in a row .
i will not be calling back later .
i will not be calling back ever .
too bad i used to like that place .
the worst customer service ever !
place has really gone down hill .
it use to be my favorite ... .
tonight , we had our meal as usual .
i was n't impressed by the food or experience .
sorry but they just do n't cut it .
and the prices were soo cheap .
the food was microwaved , and overcooked .
simply the worst dining experience i 've had .
all-in-all , it was a disappointing experience .
i will not eat here ever again !
tried to call in order .
ripoff , unprofessional and rude staff !
all she could do was lie and make excuses .
this was not acceptable .
do n't waste your time .
but i can find that in my back yard .
this place is just not for me .
could n't cut my pork belly with the knife .
the food looks like the chef does not care .
did no one see this ?
to sit on the chairs .
are awful and no one wears gloves at all !
are expensive as well .
surrounding area with picnic tables was nice though .
why no tip you ask ?
there is no service here .
so they got _num_ % of my order wrong .
i 'm never going back .
_num_ guests showed up .
it was very disappointing .
this experience was anything but fun from the beginning .
to list your sides that you could choose from .
it was n't even half full !
the cupcake was ok , moist but no flavor .
when our bill arrived our entrees totaled $ _num_ .
it was completely ridiculously overpriced .
_num_ minutes to get breakfast .
first time experience dining in was disappointing .
they 're the worst .
no waiter or waitress service .
which in pedicure language is not a good thing .
women who did my nails was terrible and rude !
the nail technician was rude and rushed me .
i will no longer visit this establishment .
it was just meh .
overall ... skip this place .
i would skip it and go to another place .
she did n't like the way i looked ?
lady was a little rude .
wo n't be back .
yet they still died .
the prices are out of sight .
not a soul in sight .
cons : no service and no prices listed !
purchased $ _num_ pot _num_ weeks ago .
clearly a miserable person with zero soft skills .
easily the worse course i have played in phoenix .
but thats really the only positives about this place .
the fairways were in bad condition as well .
finally , the bunkers had rocks and no sand .
there are much better golf courses around this place .
i do not recommend this course .
a reasonable price but still not worth the money .
they need much better signage .
the course was in such terrible shape .
all were too salty .
was n't happy with the pricing either .
all in all , disappointed .
this place is the worst .
the egg rolls , just stay away from them .
they are horrible , like seriously .
lady in the white shirt was so rude .
this is an absolute horrible place for veterans !
this is plain ridiculous .
this is the worst jack in the box around .
not over done but black .
apparently one is not there on the weekends .
i wrote an email to the _num_ teachers .
this was very painful and unexpected .
rooms do n't have lighting , unprofessional maintenance .
luxury is only in the price .
our experience through the application process was terrible .
do not rent here or even apply .
no wonder they keep changing management .
it all went downhill from there .
so this is a _num_ star review kids .
a 3-5 mile hike turned into _num_ miles .
but it gets boring fast .
all lights and tv were on .
this is unacceptable and frankly , pathetic .
is n't that just sad ?
do not go to this sun devil auto .
it would n't start well when cold .
( actual repair cost around $ _num_ ) .
this shop is total crap .
they have the worst customer service .
sun devil auto destroyed the engine on my truck !
do not rent equipment at this ace location .
if your a veteran , avoid this place .
so ... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches .
it smells like weed constantly .
cheap apartments , and for good reason .
i could n't wait to get out of there !
i would not even give you people a star .
as other have mentioned , parking is horrible .
other than that , nothing else will fit .
it was weird how different spots were different sizes .
this place is still horrible .
i tried living here twice and nothing has changed .
my ceiling leaked all winter they did nothing .
i highly advice you live elsewhere .
there were roaches underneath the hood above our stove .
the outlets did not work , very loose .
_num_ stars for customer service & a checkin offer .
_num_ for the latter .
so my advice is be careful .
be very careful with this place .
you have been warned .
it 's bs , wo n't go back .
i should have left when i smelled the place .
husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold .
do n't waste your time .
go to great wok instead for great take out .
nothing to write home about .
lots of food , but not much flavor .
hubby had szechuan chicken .
this really left an awful taste in my mouth .
but wait , there 's more .
because why would anyone question it any further ?
very poor customer service !
i will definitely not be back to his office .
i gave the one star for the owner .
it was very dirty and unorganized .
it looks outdated and very unprofessional .
i really like the idea of this place .
this place is a rip off .
`` you guys have any specials running tonight ? ''
`` that 's not part of the special . ''
so ... it 's not all domestic drafts .
i ca n't stand stuff like this .
the guy was friendly enough though .
i 'm going to try to avoid this place .
but overall this is not my scene .
a little adult interaction might do him good !
visited this location for the first time tonight .
the chicken sandwich was excellent , very tasty .
seems to be going downhill .
lunch service seems worse than dinner .
now everything but the chicken sucks and sucks badly .
that is not customer service .
i was really disappointed when i saw this .
we did not get enough wings .
wings were good , but the service was bad .
the worst possible service ever .
i will not be back .
it was not my hair color at all !
worse place i have ever lived .
since then , our showers are still having problems .
you people are freaking crazy .
said too many others rented & they came first .
you can really hear upstairs neighbors walking .
i know cockroaches happen but gross .
but for $ _num_ a month it 's not .
still have giant sewer roaches .
worst place i 've ever lived !
pinnacle please let me break my lease .
my move in has been awful .
the worst renovation style i have ever seen .
i would not recommend this property .
they could n't be more true .
just do n't rent here .
guess pizza hut lost a couple loyal customers ... .
quite honestly , this grocery store is pretty terrible .
it 's friday night and they have _num_ cashiers .
the prices are n't cheaper .
the service is not fast .
at this point i 'm done .
it was very frustrating .
i stopped on the way home tonight .
none of this is unique to this visit .
slow service with remodeled location .
do n't think i 'll stop by again .
this is no way to treat you coworkers .
worst level of customer service ever .
and do n't treat me that way !
and asked for my money back .
wo n't be coming back.
was hoping our first was a fluke .
this time was worse .
had to repeat our order _num_ times to employee .
this dirty and slow !
the taco was literally soaked in greasy sauce .
awful service , and terrible treatment .
however , the negative reviews held true .
he just looked away and walked off .
my car is still not ready .
why do they call it jiffy lube ?
this car wash is mediocre at best .
i 've been here twice .
they seem to rush the car wash process .
service here has went to crap .
this place does n't deserve even _num_ star .
i will never be spending my money here again .
worst detail i 've seen .
got the # _num_ .
let crumbs in plain sight .
wo n't be going back .
the staff is nice but their work is horrible .
he said no problem i 'll fix them .
_num_ strikes your out !
not really filthy , but dirty at best .
hard to see the cheaper wash options .
this place is now simply horrible .
the same rude worker did not remove the mats .
are they permanently closed ?
i found this sushi to be painfully mediocre .
this is the worst sushi restaurant .
the service is also terrible .
most rolls contain lots of fake crab .
i 'm not a fan .
i do n't understand how this rates so high .
maybe i 'm going at the wrong time ?
all of which make it less and less attractive .
tonight was my second visit to sakana .
i 'm a sucker for spider rolls .
she also had some unagi nigiri .
her comment : not very flavorful .
so maybe we just ordered wrong .
poor quality food , poor service ... big bummer .
this place is horrible !
service was not very quick but it was friendly .
not worth the trip in our opinion .
this place is so bad !
not a good first experience .
the only good thing was the bartender .
the service was a bit better .
i ordered a vodka cranberry instead .
probably no vodka in it .
it was very hard to keep down .
it 's a bad restaurant in every way .
the place is overpriced and completely poor quality .
unacceptable level of service from start to finish .
what 's not to like .
probably the very same week .
well ... that was a mistake .
the sushi chef was different though .
i never went back , nor will i .
this was a very disappointing experience .
i ate some bad sushi and regretted it .
i probably wo n't come here again .
i gave this place two tries .
and this place plays _num_ 's pop music loudly .
worst of all , the sushi was bizarre .
our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees .
did n't add to the experience .
not sure we 'll be back .
wo n't go again .
that 's just me being critical though .
entrees were mostly tempura too .
my boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki .
then , ten minutes later , came the ramen .
the udon was nearly gone .
i regret that decision .
the quality of the fish was very poor .
obviously once frozen and not fresh .
every thing was just a mushy mess .
it was a really unpleasant atmosphere .
the takeout experience recently was not good .
this is not an exaggeration .
recently the quality has suffered .
goodbye sakana we wo n't come back .
service could be loads better .
unimpressed , wo n't be back .
wo n't come back .
i was so disgusted .
probably wont be coming back to this place .
anyways , very disappointed with my beef teriyaki ... .
we were so disappointed .
i am so disappointed !
the sushi that we ordered was mostly just ok .
why does this place have such good reviews ?
beware is all i have left to say .
it was so bland and there was no taste .
it was n't crunchy .
it was cold and soggy .
they only get _num_ stars for the excellent service .
seaweed salad too chewy to eat .
wo n't be returning .
the vegetables were served last and were burned .
everything that came off the grill was horrible .
the rib-eye was extremely fatty , essentially like gum .
it 's the worst of the worst .
my first roll came out maybe _num_ minutes later .
avoid this place at all costs .
unfortunately , everything was bad .
salad dressing was way too salty .
was it sitting in the kitchen long time ?
rice seemed to be old .
the fish was more mushy than anything .
this is no longer here .
why on earth would anyone come to this location ?
just about every game has something wrong with it .
i have been here on _num_ occasions .
the worst experience ever .
been there before and the place was ok .
one the salad bar was worst than other days .
even saved me about $ _num_ .
staff was not friendly or attentive .
it 's not worth the wait .
not a crappy quesadilla .
the food was okay , the service was terrible .
the mac and cheese looked old .
i would suggest finding a better option .
ca n't remember his name which is a shame .
the waiter gets mad ... at me ?
service and food seems to get worse every time .
to begin with the service is horrible .
dirty , missing teeth , stained uniforms .
the food here also has gone down hill .
honestly , this was a complete disappointment .
nonetheless , all cold .
this place needs better staffing and management .
so tell me why should i try ihop again ?
very disappointed with this location lately .
if i could , i would give zero stars .
today however the experience was much less than expected .
my vegetable omelette was almost half its usual serving .
this restaurant was horrible !
the problem is service !
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
i will not be back .
do n't spend your tip all in one place !
the booth was n't even clean .
this place is disgusting .
no sir no its not .
it was a disaster and took forever to prepare .
while there , our service was terrible .
there were no clear cut winners .
the pale ale was better .
this rock bottom is awful .
a poor example of an already poor chain .
we did n't wait around to find out .
nearly all of them were unbearable to me .
no real surprise there .
the food started off pretty well .
also , their kettle chips are only okay .
the short rib is salty and overcooked .
the prime rib was tough and half was fat .
over all the food sucked and beer sucked .
oh well , just will quit going .
we had bad service from the get go .
everything is pricey too for being so-so food .
salads are $ _num_ and up .
i 've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches .
customer service could be way better .
bagels are mediocre , nothing special .
bagels were just ok .
it was very disappointing .
my omelet was bland with no seasoning on it .
however , nosh has gone downhill !
the service is terrible .
the bagels are always cold .
we just left today disappointed .
i was craving dairy queen for quite awhile .
it was was so mediocre .
needless to say i will be calling her management .
will not be back here .
spent $ _num_ on a radiator for my truck .
this big o is big crap .
you will get screwed !
i also asked to have my tires rotated .
anyway , i 'd rather not go back .
fuck you big o assholes .
avoid big o tires like the plague .
no thanks , i 'll take my business elsewhere .
no customer service here .
he did n't even tell me .
looks like i 'm going back to starbucks !
almost all gates are broken .
no it was n't even done .
cant wait till my lease is up .
worst apartment complex i have ever lived in .
then someone broke in and stole my stuff .
never got a bad meal there .
ugh , what a waste .
but if left a bad taste in my mouth .
a restaurant should n't be doing this .
this was no freakin ' mouse .
ultimately it was removed from our bill .
the worst part is the chimi was very salty .
the beans were terrible .
the salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless .
the lettuce and dressing were pretty good though .
but i just ca n't eat here .
i just really do n't like macayos .
way too much cheese all over everything .
the tortillas are not authentic mexican at all .
for starters , the chips .
a+ they are flavorful but portion size is down .
sad and not worth the money .
i did n't really get into it .
the old macayo 's was much better .
the rice was super dry as well .
i guess macayos is a crap shoot .
service was so slow !
kinda mushy ... stuff .
wow , food is very blah .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
sat on the patio ; dirty !
just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend .
in sum , it was a real shit show .
disappointed in the service we received this weekend .
the food - acceptable .
the service - inept from start to finish .
service was very bad .
bland no taste except the basics .
so not sure what was up tonight .
i have not been in forever .
service is awful and slow .
food is terrible , generic and tasteless .
they cost $ _num_ for that tiny dessert .
not enough rice to make a bowl .
the salsa has really gone downhill .
many times they do n't wan na open !
i 'm so pissed i always have problems here !
we will not go back .
the fried batter was just about all there was .
it was too sweet and has a horrible aftertaste .
panda garden - not good !
too expensive , poor value !
= not going back !
tip : hot wok mr. cook on warner rd .
everything we ordered was just ... bad .
fried rice was too oily and lacked flavor .
these dishes lack flavor .
both dishes tasted fried and lacked any real flavors .
even the rice tasted overly wet and tasteless .
terrible staff , rude .
soggy , greasy , bland food .
i email the contact to no response .
never had a problem with staff or food .
maybe more help needs to be hired .
at _num_ pm it was no customer at all .
now , soup was no taste at all !
it was very bland .
for chicken , it was okay .
i will probably not coming back .
food ... not spectacular .
the hummus was just not tasty at all .
yes you can have too much lemongrass .
thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening .
my wine cellar is the first stop .
for a minute there i was getting thirsty .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
again , a really inattentive server .
unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst .
are you kidding me ?
we will not return here .
very unfortunate for us and them .
there was about _num_ oz of steak .
bland , no flavor at all .
the service was really slow .
they were really understaffed .
the manager lady was incredibly rude to me .
the place was n't really busy .
something went wrong here tonight .
i would advise people to stay away from here .
i am so thrilled to be away from there .
i agree with sharon as the water is horrendous .
i pay _num_ $ + for water .
i can not believe how much water is .
it does not feel good and they are everywhere .
so that was disappointing as well .
but tonight was it .
talked to the staff and not much there .
just do yourself a favor and avoid this place .
worst example of luxury apartments ever .
i wish you could choose no stars .
but that is not the case .
customer service at it 's worst .
seriously , it is the worst .
customer service is a joke .
ridiculous fees all around .
it made getting things accomplished very difficult .
the restaurant however is a mess .
but the last few visits sure were disappointing .
tables were not clean .
but now its really in decline .
high prices , and lower quality .
i would n't recommend sending kids here .
i 'm very unhappy with this location .
needless to say i 'll take my business elsewhere .
what a sub-par dining experience !
that experience was n't worth the price , though .
but for dinner ... way overpriced , way overrated .
not family friendly at all .
we could not even finish it off .
the chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland .
why are we paying that much again ?
our server was so slow .
the food , however , was delicious .
but not worth the prices they charge .
skip ahead a week .
this was a terrible experience .
spend your $ _num_ elsewhere !
food was good but service was lacking .
that 's my fault for ignoring the recommendation .
the service was incredibly slow .
please comment and follow me for more reviews !
boy was i wrong .
this will not happen again .
now , i 'm a little irritated .
oh hell ... we wo n't be going back !
he just walked away .
seriously , get over yourself .
it was extremely rude .
this was supposedly a $ _num_ retail value .
we sure did n't feel welcome .
not at this place !
after our order , our waitress was hardly seen .
the service was slow and the restaurant is dated .
the cheese fondue was ok ... .
are you kidding me ?
our waitress taylor was the deal breaker for fun .
it was dark and dated in appearance .
wo n't be back .
not worth it avoid fondue and the melting pot .
we went to our table empty handed .
the table situation was another big miss .
i was very disappointed .
just not very classy .
tables were pretty small too .
barely any vodka in my $ _num_ drink .
the flavor was so bland and disappointing .
the white chocolate portion was delicious .
never poured our wine for us .
it was very pricey though .
i wo n't be going back .
wo n't bother to go back .
puff pastry , eggs , and marinara for breakfast ?
seriously no lunch until noon ?
i doubt we 'd be back .
last night , i ordered the catfish on special .
last night , they lost a regular customer !
i also came with salsa , which was terrible .
i would not recommend .
our server was lacking friendliness .
was annoyed with our gluten free questions .
this was a restaurant we ate at very frequently .
but she was barely around to ask .
the worst waitress ever .
i can not over state this .
do n't even care that the food was fine .
how could you mess those up , right ?
the french fries however were n't bad though .
just plain ole meat cooked on the flat top .
needless to say i did n't finish it .
they 've now lost our brunch business .
no do n't care about points , no !
overall just not a good feel .
now it is awful !
this store is dirty and unorganized with horrible selection .
went in yesterday and just had the worse service .
the thing that stunned me was the hostess .
the restaurant was pretty empty .
the server was not friendly at all .
i received a hot plate with cold food .
he just dropped it off and went away .
usually good but today was terrible .
the place was virtually empty .
no hamburger on this menu .
the food was mediocre .
annoying burnt toast smell the whole time .
im not the biggest fan of this store .
after driving _num_ minutes to there i was upset .
milk to be expressed .
that i would wait anywhere between 1-2 hours .
i was stuck with products i did n't need .
i was disgusted and offended .
it makes me feel like a criminal or something .
very poor customer service .
they make you feel like your in the wrong .
you told me it was no longer valid .
are you aware of false advertising ?
well , you are .
they act as clueless as you .
the service is atrocious .
not rude , but not really all there .
no cinnamon raisin not even plain ?
these were not tiny lap dogs or service dogs .
wow , unprofessional and extremely poor customer service !
no acknowledgement of any of it .
two stars because the margaritas were tasty .
the food was horrible .
they were not very good .
the redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio .
it did n't look too busy .
after about _num_ minutes we left .
kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic .
i was pretty disappointed this time around .
the waitress was a bit of a pain .
nothing special would skip it .
do n't get the shrimp tacos !
this restaurant is off my list for good .
the rice was just as bad .
the service is terrible .
it was pretty awful .
about _num_ minutes later i had a new plate .
the cheese crisp was semi cold and soggy .
i will no longer be dining here .
the food is horrible and so is the service .
also ordered a side of sour cream .
overall food was average , bland chain mexican food .
will not be back .
too many other fine mexican restaurants in the area .
but they obviously do n't train their bartenders correctly .
_num_ minutes later i get my lunch prepared incorrectly .
i ca n't eat onions and peppers .
there might be a problem .
my food came and no drink ... .
probably wo n't return anytime soon .
prices too high , service too low .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
this is not good mexican food .
my family and i will not be back .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
really slow at the bar for happy hour .
there are literally no options .
it was just a tortilla stuffed with veggies .
i will never visit this place .
but it has definitely gone downhill .
different locations of course .
food pretty good but service was so bad .
the salsa especially was so bland and tasteless .
never will go back .
after that it went downhill .
told the guy she could not eat cheese .
the food is disgusting .
alcohol could n't even make it better .
extremely mediocre mexican food .
been to _num_ different locations .
chips were n't fully fried .
my love for on the border is no more .
but what i paid $ _num_ is absolutely pathetic .
tiny little bowl that is barely a snack .
barely any beans or rice .
things took a turn for the worse .
this one did n't impress me .
it 's hard to ruin pasta .
horrible service at this location .
only one small problem .
not worth the money .
this place is not clean .
_num_ dollars for shit for food .
however nothing ever looks appetizing .
sadly , not true .
selections do n't seem to change much .
this place is full of incompetent barbers .
i recently went to joe 's for a haircut .
the wait was long but stuck it out .
i wear my hair long .
it seems they are getting worse and worse .
that to me is really shady .
are you kidding me ?
worst gel manicure i 've ever received .
not coming here again .
i had n't even mentioned my experience .
another woman there was having a worse time .
however my last visit has officially sealed the deal .
terrible customer service store !
went in and no one even acknowledged me .
i would not recommend anyone to this place .
i would not recommend !
so that was it ... and we walked out !
nothing to write home about .
prices were nice and cheap .
was n't worth it .
they were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever .
the cash and messed my order up .
my destination is _num_ minutes from this location .
the beans are all cold .
spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated .
whether , chinese , mexican , greek .
it was n't the cleanest place either .
there is no waiter service .
prices were quite reasonable .
sadly i wo n't be going back .
they tasted like rubber just very bland .
well , i 'm gon na be honest .
the food is bad .
meat is not the freshest .
the prices are ridiculous .
i took it up and showed the cashier girl .
try burrito company instead .
_num_ minutes for six tacos is ridiculous .
so it was half full ... .
the meat essentially had no flavor at all .
for me , prices get a thumbs down .
it was disgusting in flavor and texture .
taco bell has better bean and cheese burritos .
this is not truly good , authentic mexican food .
however , thumbs up for customer service .
this is not truly good , authentic mexican food .
however , thumbs up for customer service .
the biggest disappointment was the music selection .
it was terrible and not family friendly music .
i ca n't imagine coming back .
do n't go on taco tuesday .
it 's flat out terrible actually .
poor , hard , dry chicken .
i would n't serve those beans to my dog .
they must have no clue what mexican food is .
unfortunately the increased size has increased the wait .
is not worth it .
this was my 1st time trying this place out .
salsas are less than o.k .
no sincere apology whatsoever , really crappy service overall .
really disappointed with the service .
but service was bad .
broke ass mexican food at hipster prices .
basically , f this place .
if i could give this zero stars i would .
took over _num_ minutes to get our order .
they also had stopped serving breakfast for some reason .
the manager was not friendly ( never smiles .
and the staff is somewhat inept , if friendly .
something was wrong with his front leg .
i just relocated from los angeles _num_ weeks ago .
first impressions mean everything .
i boarded him for _num_ days .
i did n't like the vibe of the place .
one unhappy client is _num_ unhappy clients .
a no-frills , no charm grease spoon .
the pitas are soggy and so are the fries .
thinking he would take my tray i said yes .
the chicken was dry & tasted weird .
we ordered a gyro and a chicago hot dog .
this place is horrible .
service here is just unacceptable .
they could not even make any of them out .
it was easily the worst experience of my life !
it was very posh .
she still should have just told me no .
signed sad but will take my sale elsewhere .
the second sofa was again made very sloppy .
i did not put it on lay away .
than i was told martin the manager said no .
i will never again buy at the room store .
that 's not the real issue though .
still no call back from him .
i 'm about ready to return it .
so after about _num_ minutes we were done .
is n't that classy ?
nothing like having company over .
they apparently have no desire to do so .
_num_ weeks later , still nothing .
i really hate the way we have been treated .
they could n't even get that right .
zero stars are what this company deserves .
customer service does n't exist here .
this probably is n't even real leather .
chairs were cancelled , no problem .
we will not be back .
so glad this place is going under .
only about _num_ % of the couch is leather .
nothing but cheap plastic and vinyl junk !
not worth a 1/3 of what we paid for .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
i do n't even want to rate _num_ star .
pedicure lasted _num_ week .
worst pedicure i 've had .
ample enough time to do a mani/pedi .
there was nothing relaxing about this experience .
i am not going back .
this was a horrible experience .
i dread going into this bank .
this place is awful .
if i could give negative stars i would .
it was freezing cold .
the reception staff is rude and unfriendly .
i 'm a really low maintenance client .
i couldnt believe my ears .
all of it lost .
talk about a disaster .
absolutely the worst customer service from the geek squad .
stay away and spend your money elsewhere !
was in the store for _num_ minutes .
i did not want that phone again .
the geek squad people are even worse .
this is not a lost cause .
customer service here is really odd .
she said no ... and just walked away .
the hardest error to get off a computer !
either way , not cool .
i suggest going to the chandler mall location .
found it , it does not .
just do n't you computer repaired at best buy .
my feet were left rough and polish was sloppy .
place looked average clean .
i do n't get my nails done a lot .
i will not be going back .
worst place i 've never been to .
nails are filled horribly .
i give them negative five stars .
extremely rude staff , poor quality job .
no need for the rude attitude .
the guy was arrogant .
wo n't be going back .
the pedicure was below average .
i should 've walked then !
do n't waste your time here .
kids screaming , ruining up and down the hallways .
do not stay here .
i was very angry .
i am never staying here again .
she gave me attitude whenever i requested fresh linen .
this was not a stay away from home for me.
who cares that i am freezing cold i guess .
seriously what hotel does n't provide hair dryers anymore .
also , it is very very loud .
it was actually very hard to sleep .
no breakfast served because the food never arrived !
the front of refrigerator was dirty with stuck food .
dirty sticky kitchen area counters .
the room was definitely not cleaned .
reservations apparently mean nothing here .
front desk staff is clueless .
if i could give it less than i would .
woke up to a roach watching me nap .
worst hotel i have stayed in by far .
he did n't even look up from his computer .
my have they changed .
no eye contact no hello .
absolute worst customer service at this store .
could n't find bath bubbles to save my life !
the customer service counter is a joke !
i purchased a few items and went to checkout .
she did not give me the proper change .
she gave me the change without any apology .
just come here for dropping off packages !
the manager does not know anything about computers .
this is not the first time .
i told her , i know .
after _num_ mins explaining , then i said fedex .
i am so stupid .
i wish i would have never went here .
not 11pm , or a few minutes before .
i guess this is the deal for you .
the pizza was also cold , seemed old .
no one has gloves on !
but this place is just not worth the money .
flat and pretty much surrounded my houses .
all in all just a very run down facility .
well this just confirmed by belief .
i scheduled an oil change over a week ago .
really poor customer service .
pretty lame subs and sandwiches .
service was okay but nothing to yelp positively about .
sadly , they both were not good .
i 'm not coming back .
_num_ , maybe _num_ seconds ?
sanitation on that situation = _num_ .
my chips taste terrible .
not crunchy at all .
i 'm just never coming back again .
the checkout line is long and atrocious .
she walks off and never came back !
however , this store is poorly maintained .
are you kidding me ?
i left without buying anything .
horribly long lines to check out .
too bad no stars is n't an option .
avoid if you can !
the woman was extremely rude .
does n't matter anymore , they lost a customer .
needless to say i was very dissatisfied .
ive gone here about eight times over a year .
she did n't even bat an eye about it .
this place has gone downhill so so fast .
they are terrible customer service people .
the last two were awful .
friendly enough , but i will not go back .
to see a crappy band ?
this place was horrible for a last minute drink .
jack 's is probably a good neighborhood drinking hole .
rude service , cold food , watered down drinks .
i wish i could give minus stars .
i 've never received a call back .
they do n't care .
she just missed out on so many things .
she did n't miss charging me , though .
never again will i go this vet .
initial drink service was slow .
and the food was not good , either .
skip that bread too .
it 's soggy and stale .
good location , average food , but too expensive .
drink service is slow .
good location , average food , but too expensive .
drink service is slow .
overpriced , and not a good experience .
_num_ different prices for the same brand of beer .
mozzarella cheese sticks average to good .
pasta bland sauce also .
vegetables first time accompanied that dish not tasty .
wife ordered the worst eggplant she ever tasted .
not an enjoyable dinner _num_ 1/2 stars .
oh ... but it gets better .
$ _num_ for what ?
felt ripped off and very disappointed .
no presentation at all ?
do you not know what oysters rockefeller are ?
otherwise , it 's a negative number .
skip it and go somewhere else .
the service was bad .
for the prices they charge i expect more .
the customer service sucked .
however i wo n't be going back any more .
no warm greeting for us !
they were n't very hot and were pretty soft .
only the drinks were correct .
fool me once shame on me but never again .
i wish i could give no stars .
kind of bland , a little pricey .
nello 's you really let me down .
very bland , poor tasting pizza !
does not live up to the hype !
the crust was thick , chewy and tasteless .
it was a very bad product .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
may come back may not .
i walked out , plain and simple .
as i recall , it was much better .
i hate wasting money on bad food !
i have been going to boston market for years .
so tonight i returned .
now it has fallen below the minimal acceptable standard .
food is nothing to rave about .
the quality of food is no longer there .
now i remember why we stopped coming .
it was very clean but pretty empty .
this store lost a customer .
its mediocre at the very best .
gave ra two chances .
total waste of money .
mom did n't like the soup , as well .
our server appeared shortly after we were sat .
for dessert , we ordered the banana maki .
ra is the worst place to go for sushi .
do n't eat there .
the hostess was terrible - not inviting at all !
- but our waitress was awesome .
but the veggie tempura was terrible !
it 's chain , keep your expectations low .
their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway .
its just not happening .
the sushi was n't very fresh at all .
a pricy place to grab a bite .
cheap sake , cheap beers , cheap sushi .
would i recommend the sushi ?
the service was horrible .
it was just annoying .
the service could be so much better .
way over priced for less than average sushi .
some of the combos are just gross !
mediocre food and poor service .
i wo n't be back .
food is barely average and going down hill fast .
the service was not good .
talk about bad service .
this place has awful service .
awful , horrible , terrible service .
she was so rude about it .
why is the service always so bad here ?
slow , inattentive and very lax .
when i asked the price she said $ _num_ .
i figured , okay it was a bad night .
what really got me angry ?
what a joke at ray road .
this place is mediocre at best .
the nigiri and rainbow roll was just ok .
the fish was n't the most flavorful .
the spicy tuna roll was just bad .
it was n't real spicy tuna !
my husband said they were n't bad .
however , i wo n't be back .
then she disappeared again for _num_ mins .
the waitress we had was not attentive at all .
all i tasted was squeezed lime .
it was n't very busy .
the service was n't very good .
the short rib appetizers were bland and very fatty .
the vegetable roll was very bland as well .
bad drinks , bad food , bad service .
tonight , we called ahead for party of _num_ .
you pissed me off beyond repair tonight .
overly pepper short ribs .
like a stale fish smell .
at that point they refused to serve us alcohol .
they will ensure you a terrible time .
i stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken .
try great wok instead .
even the sriracha sauce was bland ?
i got the pad thai and it was dry .
well , it did n't get fix .
not going to eat there anymore .

all this for _num_ dollars .
i walked out disgusted .
_num_ cashier was friendly .
food is n't anything special !
terrible service , stay away from this place .
really expected better food after seeing _num_ stars .
will not go back again unless calling ahead .
they changed owners recently and the food has suffered .
after this last time i will not be returning .
not at all like it used to be .
no pride in the food .
not worth your money or your time .
unfortunately this place is painfully slow .
tables were not being cleaned after customers left .
go to panda garden guys this place is awful .
then they started quickly going down hill .
wo n't order takeout or delivery here again .
ordered _num_ separate dishes .
the pad thai and the ginger shrimp broccoli .
the ginger shrimp broccoli had no flavor .
it was a waste of calories .
i did n't finish it obviously .
hence the reason the flavors were weak .
i 'm so mixed on this place .
the driver only had $ _num_ on him .
`` the driver does n't have them . ''
absolutely unacceptable and disgusting .
it was clean and the staff were really courteous .
my pho was not really good .
maybe canned soup would be more competition .
do they make canned pho ?
i would order again .
really turned me off .
i 'll get my magazines elsewhere .
this place is a rip off .
they were very courteous and apologetic .
after _num_ hours my vehicle was ready .
the next day i noticed oil on my driveway .
no , i replied .
it 's this brake masters that is n't fine .
the quote just for the rear was $ _num_ !
so i mentioned this yelp review .
dry , skimpy and tasteless .
staff seems friendly but nothing stands out .
just waited over _num_ minutes .
it seriously sucked no flavor at all .
she did n't greet us or say a word .
still not a word from her .
she was extremely rude !
me being there was such an inconvenience to her .
this location is very skimpy on the food .
i would not recommend this location to anyone .

just unfriendly and crowded .
but my nightmares about it wo n't .
shame on gold 's gym .
just say no to this place .
paid over $ _num_ to get out this place .
just avoid this place .
not to mention that their facilities are in decline .
overall , very disappointed with the customer service here .
do n't waste your time with this gold 's .
scam - false advertising to the max degree .
i would not go to this gym again .
the machines are worn out and old .
this does n't exist anymore .
i had such a bad experience here .
i asked for a full set with gel polish .
i was so annoyed .
she did the most horrible job .
if i could give them a _num_ i would .
worst pedicure and customer service .
huge waste of time and money .
art , the store manager , is completely incompetent .
the rest of the staff is pretty much clueless .
just for convenience can be very expensive !
the carpet is this yucky commercial low pile stuff .
we booked _num_ rooms , _num_ being handicap accessible .
the 2nd room booked was fine .
got checked in , and went to my room .
not even a pen to write something down .
they are very rude and extremely unprofessional .
i am so disappointed !
what i hate are the fees .
one time we let it spin for _num_ minutes .
hell yes i do !
bottom line : no tickets .
big fat thumbs down !
what a garbage company .
no directions , no nothing .
maybe i just expect too much anymore ?
i was n't impressed for a number of reasons .
i did not like the rooms .
there was a baby sink and mirror area .
the beds were mediocre .
arrived and an hour wait just to check-in .
lobby is hot , uncomfortable temp wise .
i wo n't be back though .
and i ca n't stop laughing .
very limited menu and as with most places overpriced .
would not stay here again .
i booked a suite for a conference .
_num_ '' tube tvs in the room ?
only stayed here because the conference was here .
will not be coming back .
this place could be so much better .
the water park is the highlight of this resort .
the room on the other hand was very outdated .
staff was friendly with everyone i encountered .
poor service with staff making terrible decisions .
not enough chairs anywhere to accommodate guests .
_num_ or _num_ perhaps ?
never - never a _num_ .
the tub did n't drain .
the fridge did n't get cold .
very dated and in need of tlc .
terrible food , terrible service .
the hotel itself is large and spread out .
the outside of the buildings are old and tired .
is n't that like training _num_ ?
this is a hard review to write .
the valet people could n't have been nicer .
posted times were open weekly until 9:30 .
so it 's a wash for me .
but it 's just not a high end experience .
the rooms are really dated .
ok , starting at the beginning .
- the room was hot .
worst hotel experience ever .
avoid this place at all costs !
trust me you do n't want to stay here !
we could n't bring in juice for our kids .
for $ _num_ a drink i felt taken advantage .
it was so loud and ridiculous at that hour .
stayed here this past week on business travel .

they were completely bad .
_num_ dollars for a hotdog , come on .
stay elsewhere , it 's that simple .
please do n't stay here .
the water slide and lazy river is not working !
our keys does n't work when we checked in .
i hate this place .
the room was musty and the food was so-so .
would not recommend this resort .
this property is old and tired .
glad i did n't pay for that either .
checked in at 6:00 to find out was closed .
made brittany refund that charge .
there was absolutely no value to it at all .
my wife and daughter would remain in the car .
the valet demanded my car keys .
it looks like a rear entrance .
11:00 turns and the gate does n't open .
it just feels very unclean .
just not happy with this experience so far .
but the rooms / cleanliness / etc .
is not up to par .
the staff needs an upgrade .
hotel rooms not so good .
this place is quite outdated .
he was extremely rude .
for _num_ hours , rarely checked in on us .
staff has been rude or non-existent at every turn .
the rooms are outdated and dirty .
the mattress is all springs with no mattress left .
the general building and grounds are tired !
the wave pool was a joke .
the lazy river was always packed with people .
it was way over crowded and downright dangerous .
this place leaves much to be desired .
the staff is incompetent .
very poor customer service .
which is understandable but nothing was done .
no compensation took place .
we were here to celebrate our first anniversary .
at least motel _num_ will leave the light on .
we will never spend time or money here again .
this is not one of them .
seriously this place is a ripoff !
umm , just a bad experience here .

so they gave me a complimentary mani .
kinda nice gave us a chance to chit chat .
$ _num_ dollar pedi .
so we are done with that disaster .
such a waste of time and money .
that is so stupid .
the water park was not even all that .
save your money and go elsewhere .
run from this money pit !
the only problem is the huge expense for everything !
the course is in pathetic shape .
it was ok the rooms were clean .
the price was more then our cabana in hawaii .
service at poolside bad .
after _num_ mins on hold we gave up .
i was really disappointed in this property .
next , really , there are no luggage carts ?
i was seriously disappointed by this resort .
we checked in at 4:30 and left at 7:30 .

the grounds and getting around was very confusing .
room very loud with freeway noise .
over an hour wait for cold sandwiches .
halfway through my week stay .

the band is too loud .
the ambiance and view is a _num_ .
the service is a _num_ .
i have no words .
_num_ for atmosphere and _num_ for food .
and i do n't mean good !
to call this a steakhouse is laughable .

the salad was watery from too much ranch .
service was slow but adequate .
seriously , do not go here .

my wife 's wings were overcooked and poor tasting .
cool atmosphere but i would n't recommend eating here.
there was an hour wait to be seated .
( the drinks were way over priced anyways ! )
the food was absolutely terrible .
this place is considered a steakhouse ?
more like a child care service with mediocre food .
stupid kids running everywhere .
they have a home ranch that is awesome .
the accompanying fried mushrooms were tasty .
the second time around was a joke .
do not wear a tie !
the carrots are overcooked .
their seasoning is lacking and the steak was bland .
needless to say , i 'll never be back .
it was pretty disappointing to say the least .
it fell way way short .
it 's not for classy people .

no salt on the rim .
waiting for _num_ pm !
not even in a nice tone !
oh and all booths are empty .
my poor mother is bummed !

literally in ten mins everything was out .
the bill came out to $ _num_ for four .
poor bull ... hardly even moves in there .
this was the worst experience we 've had here !
horrible service and just okay food .
after starting out okay , it quickly went downhill .
not sure we 'll come back after this experience .
checked this place out after a relative suggested it .
there were _num_ of us .
we could n't even get water refills .
they had an excuse for everything tasting terrible .

no more visits there for me .
i 've gone in several times for gel manicures .
my experience mirrors kevin i 's below .
my services were free because i refused to pay .
not because she comped me .
also , my nails were never painted .
my most recent experience was not good .
she was very aggressive with my eyebrow wax .
that 's never happened to me before with waxing .

it 's not great like everyone thinks !
both come and i try them with no success .
my computer wo n't recognize the new battery .
on day three , i call to check in .

i was not impressed and very disappointed .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
i was not greeted until _num_ minutes later .
it was very awkward and i felt very uncomfortable .
this is not how you treat someone .
that should n't be allowed to happen .
our experience at thai basil was sub-par at best .

we will not be back there again .
it was a weekday and they were terribly understaffed .
it actually turned out to be _num_ .
also an item was missing from my order .

no apology , no smile .
lack of urgency for getting orders out .
it was _num_ strikes and you 're out .
the service was absolutely horrible .
bad bad bad kfc !
worst location i 've ever been !
it was nothing short of trash worthy .
not worth the _num_ bucks we just spent here .
no apology after yelling at me or anything .
bad service mediocre food .
this location was the reason i stopped eating kfc .
the wo n't sell you just chicken .

fried chicken with no napkins .
this kfc is worst by far .
the old indian guy working there is rude .

we were there for at least _num_ hours .
the spinach dish was terrible !
the rice desert was not worth mentioning , bland !
food was mediocre and service was abysmal .

such a waste of time !
terrible , avoid at all costs .
the owner is rude and clearly they are unsanitary .
a large cheese thin crust pizza is _num_ bucks .
tonight , we got the thin crust .
it was the same experience .
this place is slow and the pizza sucks .
she offered garlic bread instead .
alright , i guess .
the sauce has little garlic flies in it .
you should avoid this place at all costs .
get it together , rosati 's .
pizza is n't that complicated of a business .
he could n't find the lady 's pizza order .
the lady sat down to wait , obviously frustrated .
hey , do n't take my word for this .
just kidding , just kidding !
the roast beef sandwich i ordered was tough .
do n't trust me .
obviously , they have not fixed the problem .
they could n't even get that right .
way too expensive for what we got .
no explanation no sorry !
really so i 'm a liar again .
me : sigh ... .
just another way to get more money .
they adjusted the gas charges to $ _num_ .
worst experience ever in renting a car .
extremely disappointed with this location !
my coworker ordered me a large fake turkey sub .
your business should too .

so dry like eating cardboard .
took _num_ bites and threw the rest away .
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
are you kidding me ?
jesus christ the employees were slow and rude .

but the changes were n't just with the food .
i was not impressed with my order .
got so so sick after eating here last night .
it was a horrible experience .
last visits just not the same , obviously .
man , has this place really went downhill .
it 's dirty and outdated .
it 's a shame .
man , has this place really went downhill .
it 's dirty and outdated .
it 's a shame .
a sandwich shop that does n't have any rolls !
what poor planning and management .
ca n't wait to move !
that is my biggest complaint here .
and they never solved that problem .
shady shady shady and unprofessional office staff .
turn over monthly in that place .
do not rent take your money somewhere else .
the office staff is the worst part .
if i could give no stars i would .
the 1st time i went for just a milkshake .
drive through quickly at 10:30 in the morning .
not the definition of fast food .
i used _num_ tan and had _num_ left .
i find it totally ridiculous .
not traditional chinese food .
not worth the money .
the rice was overcooked .
because i got chicken tenders , not chunks .
do n't waste your time or money .
3rd time we 've tried - 3x bad .
one bite & threw out .
ate few pieces of chicken , could n't stomach .
do n't eat here .
i had to spit out several pieces .
sorry , not good at all .
quite bland , watery , dishes .
anyway , it went down from there .
the receptionist maria who scheduled my appt was horrible .
i called in , made an appointment .
now they want to charge me .
make another appointment , take more time off .
ranks are questionable at best .
avoid this location and its owner .
however my protein was no longer on sale .
no courtesy at all .
the repairs were n't fixed very well either .
the cherry wood cabinets are just painted brown .
gates are left open all night long .
this does not appeal to me .
all my experiences have thus far been satisfactory .
i will never be back .
the front office staff were rude and very short .
i did really like the physician however .
the new front office people are terrible .
a sour cream burrito !
a lettuce burrito to chase a sour cream burrito !
cold shredded cheese immediately followed by melted cheese !
one week later , check engine light comes on .
how much , i asked ... $ _num_ .
i wait another _num_ minutes .
they just do n't know it yet .
was n't ready till the following afternoon .
appointments do nothing here .
not the place for me though !
regular brakes would have been fine .
advised to keep driving and bring back if continues .
i was so disappointed when going here .
do n't waste your time at this place .
this place is a joke and a rip off .
so yeah , i 'm pissed at them .
the service there is hit or miss at best !
food is good service is very poor .
i am not a picky person .
_num_ minutes after that , my appetizer came out .
and i 'm not exaggerating .
that is not the case here .
a shame because it has so much potential .
we asked for napkins twice to no avail .
bored wait staff , no ambience .
they truly do n't deserve it !
well that 's not a good sign !
why was it taking so long ?
needless to say we would never come back here .
i do not suggest supporting this establishment .
he made us feel extremely uncomfortable .
wo n't be back .
for food , i think the place is overrated .
this lobster ravioli was priced around $ _num_ .
was there $ _num_ worth of food there ?
the portion to price ratio is very skimpy .
that 's what got this place _num_ stars .
however , my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells .
our first experience , the service was ridiculously slow .
the manager seemed loud and overbearing .
they left even more annoyed than we did .
however , two chances is all i 'm giving .
none of the salads are included with the entrees .
my wife and i went there last friday night .
i am really confused about the difference .
we were less than impressed , unfortunately .
unfortunately , neither one of us were satisfied .
that was n't the waitresses fault !
prices were even higher than what they were .
snow crab is n't even in season .
the lack of information is incredibly frustrating .
the lack of information and poor service is unacceptable .
do n't waste your time or money !
very poor customer service and even worse results .
i could not be more disappointed .
but we did n't know which one it was .
so we guessed and they replaced that tire .
i was given my keys very quickly and thanked .
no more `` discount '' tire for me .
looking around , customers are not happy !
plenty of employees , no excuse really .
in short , i followed their process .
i wasted my day .
never gon na buy tires from this place ever .
should have stayed with costco .
discount would not stand behind their failed work .
does anyone expect a lot from a chinese buffet ?
this place was just half ass .
i had a plate of cold food every time .
such a waste of money .
meh , i have had way better !
service staff seemed quite disinterested in actually providing service .
probably had forgotten why .
the last time i went , everything tasted old .
it is a shame that all were so bland .
i will not be back .
the clams and crab were flavorless .
we were very disappointed .
this review is not in regards to the food .
i have been several times and nope it sucks .
the meat taste strange , i mean real strange .
nothing gourmet here , greasy fried food .
save your money and go elsewhere .
not surprised that this place was n't impressive .
the food was cold or dry and stale .
the salmon sushi had a weird taste to it .
_num_ persons $ _num_ .
then , he comes back .
then ... he comes back .
i decide i want no part if this scene .
he says i wasted food .
nothing special about this place .
most of it was horrible !
soggy and runny with water dripping out from everywhere .
never again are we going back.
food quality is questionable .
too expensive for what you get .
we wo n't be going back .
very disappointed in quality of food .
not a good selection of food .
stay away and find some other place .
we ate over half our meals without any refills .
it was barely room temperature .
do n't want food poisoning ?
do n't go to hong kong !
we went there last night and it was terrible .
the food was obviously left out for some time .
we will never return here again .
overly priced , mediocre food .
worst buffet i 've ever been to !
it does n't make sense .
they refilled the shrimp tempura one time .
they did n't even have any and pepper shrimp .
they did n't have oysters .
the food here is of very cheap quality .
very limited selection for the mongolian bbq .
the food on the buffet was lukewarm .
the food was chewy and just bad overall .
i left merchandise on counter and walked out .
ca n't price match your own website ?
these people have no conscious !
stay away for any significant service work .
screw all these guys , so dishonest .
will not go back ever .
this is a horrible starbucks !
it 's very disappointing because we love starbucks !
it took _num_ minutes to get our drinks !
no suggestion for something else , like what ?
worst starbucks service in the general area .
if you can avoid this location , do it .
the coffee tasted like cheap , burnt beans .
really disappointed with this starbucks .
customer service is extremely lacking .
orders are often wrong .
apologies seem to be in short supply , also .
this girl needs some serious customer service training .
that 's why i asked what you needed .
no apology , nothing .
i left highly annoying .
it takes _num_ seconds to pour .
it seems like customer service is not important here .
she did , in no way rude at all .
really , just disgusting .
after tonight , f -- - del taco !

never seen this before in a restaurant , ever .
left immediately and will not be back .
i may not be back !
that annoyed us so we said never mind .
worst customer service ever !
went to another foot dr. for a second option .
the service is slow and grumpy .
the pizza is thin and chewy and way overpriced .
nothing special tasting about anything served here either .
just like the brick they put in my stomach .
too much time between making the salad and service .
my husband and i could not finish anything .
the service was not that friendly .
the meatballs tasted as if they were frozen .
the pizza crust lacked flavor but was crunchy .
basically , this is mall food court quality stuff .
absolutely not _num_ stars .
food here was bland .
this will come back to bite me , hard .
billing office was a complete nightmare .
this is where the trouble starts .
my experience was horrible .
please do not go to see this doctor .
i am not going back there .
this should not be this way .
they wo n't call me back ever .
why would they ignore me like this .
it just makes me remember how bad they are .
i ordered breakfast , which was just alright .
i abandoned them after a couple of bites .
being they were so bust service was slow .
that could make someone really sick .
i am not sure how this could happen .
how does bad food get out of the kitchen ?
the food was n't even particularly hot .
the toast was not toasted completely .
maybe lunch would be better ?
what a waste of time and money .
the waitress could care less .
no onion , etc or anything - plain .
my total bill for my plate was _num_ dollars .
worst breakfast i have ever had .
ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage .
was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick .
i know this is not disneyland !
it was absolutely ridiculous .
that was an insult .
it 's not anything like it use to be .
i like my scrambled eggs done .
wo n't be going back anymore .
the atmosphere is that of a very noisy cafeteria .
certainly , there are better places for breakfast .
raw chicken is serious .
my visit to this establishment was n't pleasant .
the kitchen was also slow today .
just ca n't do it .
now , for the minus _num_ stars part .
what job out there does n't fit that bill !
albertsons is my closest grocery store .
they do n't sell your information .
certificate to show their concern .
the burger was lacking excitement .
bland was the theme of the day here .
the place was dirty and poorly kept .
the food was not good .
how can a burger be done so wrong ?
it needed to close , this one was bad .
the director is so rude !
she always makes unnecessary comments .
left my # every time .
i had the receipt and requested a price adjustment .
this is the worst of them .

no coming back to this location again .
however , it was at least _num_ mins .
but i ca n't fault the waiter for that .
my son 's however was really yummy .

so hats off to you !
bathrooms are extremely disgusting .
smelly , dirty ... just gross all around .
the gluten free crust is horrible .

it is an on again off again situation .
this place was not good tonight for several reasons .
i find this annoying .
he responded with $ _num_ .
so , $ _num_ i paid .
people are not as friendly as some other places .
i got the gel manicure and the spa pedi .
this is not supposed to happen .
ugh , i 'm upset .
worst manicure ever , chipped the next day .
none of my nails were the same shape .
which i must say caused an awkward moment .
i would n't return for services .
i had cindy , she may be the owner .
other than that the place was empty .
too bad it 's so close to my house .
( except for the lack of selection ! )
slow check out as well !
makeup staff is rude .
i scheduled an appointment with jen for a haircut .
i was trying something new , and getting bangs .
that is not what i got .
is n't that what people always do ?
worst dry cleaners in the valley !
i will never use desert ridge cleaners again .
they have lost another pair of pants .
i will never use this cleaners again .
and the tailor is n't in on weekends .
i will never go back to this place again .
avoid at all costs .
terrible customer service- calls never returned .
bad service with poor tailoring .
`` we will call you '' .
the service was n't all that great either .
quantity - here 's where they really fall behind .
for desert ridge i would suggest another place .
i am never going back .
how could management not see that .
there smoothie tastes like crap .
this was not my first time getting crappy service .
no sense of urgency whatsoever .
will not be back .
this place is gross .
bland tasteless meat , mushy vegetables , plain bread .
i will not be back .

the portions are very short and just not fresh .
the floor was just as bad .

if i could give zero stars i would .
the worst customer service ever .
they never acknowledged me .
horrible customer service , i was never greeted .
all paradise bakeries are busy !

but now my visits have been disappointing .
i love paradise bakery but this location is terrible .
staff is not great , to say the least .
they are not accommodating .
i was very disappointed .
worst coffee i 've literally ever had ever .
really , not even a carrot stick ?

the tuna was watery brown mayonnaise goo .
the ordering setup for this place is extremely awkward .
needless to say i did not make a purchase .
god these guys are so rude .
matt was beyond rude and unhelpful .
however , there hours are great !
more money for my dogs .
i took my puppy on april _num_ , _num_ .
one leg was groomed the other three were not .
top of head was halfway done .
was too busy to be bothered with me .
check out clerks seem unhappy .
worst grooming experience ever .
i am definitely not going back there for grooming .
this location for dog grooming is horrible !
the groomers here are super inexperienced .
because the dog groomers here are lazy !
do not get your dog groomed here .
fair warning , do not go here .
my fish tacos had room temp .
and i do n't mean that as a compliment .
i am not exaggerating .
i 'd probably regret drinking that much anywhere else .
fries greasy and customer service poor .
unfortunately , island is n't up with the times .
food was barely warm and flavorless .
it was fairly disappointing ... .
not very flavorful at all .
nothing like i remember .
i probably would n't return .
it just looks picked over and sad .
their $ _num_ loyalty credit in confusing as well .
money is n't everything in this world .
worst sales reps ever .
this location gets worse and worse .
verizon store reps used to be helpful .

rating _num_ and half .
not worth the price of our meal .
_num_ of us ordered drinks and i ordered sweets .
the red onion overwhelmed the salad .

the food is a tad better than okay .

and everything else is only fair .
i had the italian trio sampler which was bland .
the dinner was a disaster .

the food is mediocre .
but this evening was a disaster .
not what i remembered from this place .
what a disappointing birthday dinner .
the food was terrible too .
this was a disappointing item .
the service this time was n't very good .

the chicken was like chewing a piece of rubber .
the food was awful .

i am extremely disappointed because i like the menu .
i can only question : are they understaffed ?

no one needs to put up with this .
i too would give this place negative stars .
my grilled chicken was swimming in grease .
ok super horrible service !

i 'd give it negative stars if possible .
she did not finish it .
it was decent but lacked any depth .
they could n't even do that right .
the baked prosciutto & mozzarella was disgusting .

and this was not even close .
this is wine not tang .
too little too late .
the bathrooms were filthy and the service was abysmal .
the entire experience was disappointing .
i would n't recommend this location .
it was a disaster .
most of the other reviews will support my experience .

not the worst , not the best .
i just do n't get it .

the service today , however , was sub par .
she did not offer me a receipt .

we sat down in a booth .
_num_ min later she brought out or coffee .
the diner was n't busy at all .
the food was ok , service was horrible .

they kept pushing me to add all these extras .
the bathrooms are completely disgusting .
i hate shell , and especially danny 's .
i will never go back to just brakes .

_num_ stars because their waitresses are rude !
sorry i wasted my money with this company .
i was very unimpressed with my visit .

the pharmacy is a nightmare .
cvs just lost another loyal customer .
the absolute worst pharmacy i 've ever dealt with .
they give exactly zero cares .

the caesars salad was wilted and somewhat brown .

they serve me sake wine glass !
everyone of these drinks were just terrible !
meal # _num_ was filet mignon with teppanyaki shrimp .

even my _num_ yr old hated it .
looks like a converted subway with an actual grill .
my wrap was sad .
this place is just not for me .
just not for me .
i would not step foot in that store again .
i was too lazy to go anywhere else .
their quality is terrible .

be careful not to sit next to the kitchen .
raw sewage smell from the bathrooms .
the pretzel sticks were dry and bland .
i did n't try it .

this place does not do viet cuisine justice .
the pho was very sub par .
the shrimp and pork fried eggrolls for $ _num_ ?
i would not return here again .
* rice noodles in my chicken pho are gummy .

this is an attempt at pho and vietnamese food .
not a fan of americanized pho .
what a huge disappointment .

it kind of grossed me out .
the rest just downhill from there .
and the green onions were n't even chopped well .
i just left out of there disappointed !
the beef in the pho was tough .

it does not sound true .
arrogant , unprofessional , disinterested sales people .
useless , disinterested , internet sales people .
i had a questionable experience with this dealership .
they said nothing needed to be done .
i would n't even give this dealership one star .
audi north scottsdale literally stole my car from me .
absolutely the worst service in the city .
the experience was lackluster and really uncomfortable at times .
we left angry and disappointed with this dealer .
not one of the original issues !

i finally just walked out .
the receptionist is rude .
i was very embarrassed .

the experience they had was way less than pleasant .
that 's too bad .
this outlet lacks good retail shops !
they do n't care !
pizza was terrible and i was hungry .
they do n't deserve your hard earned money .
you guys do n't deserve to have my business .
pizza might be good if it was hot .
no one seems trained at all .
way to reward loyal customers domino 's .
really , avoid this one like the plague !
still wo n't try the food again .
the food is not very good .
the anthem mcdonald 's is a joke .
it 's not a difficult job .

he does not have ethical business practices .
yikes , this food was terrible .
super greasy , tasteless pizza .
not even domino 's .
i wish i could give zero stars .

this is not it !
the owner does not seem to like his job .
so she then said they would call me back !
tough , over cooked , half cold .
the breadsticks were boring and dull .
do n't waste your time ordering here .
_num_ stars for the drive through .

service sucked and food was mediocre at best .
first , and last visit unfortunately .
first , it was dirty and dingy inside .
i felt dirty just sitting down .

on the positive , restaurant seems cleaner .
beyond that , restaurant remains subpar .
my order upfront was wrong on three separate occasions .
unfortunate , because i was excited for the change .
hamburger and fries were cold .

and it was sub par at best .
`` no problem , '' they say .
just do n't bother with this place .
the gas is stupid expensive .
the staff is hit and miss .
some are okay , some are downright apathetic .
unfortunately i echo most of the reviews here .
bathrooms constantly covered with crap ... literally .
not the best location .
no sign or anything explaining that .
decor had n't been updated since _num_ .
the other waitress could have covered up some .
looked like she was going to a club .
restaurant full of smoke when we walked in .
lots of mushrooms but not much meatball .
almost to the point of being too much .
it was cheap but probably wo n't go back .
i would never go back to this place again .
checked out this place from the groupon last night .
that should not happen with white pizza .
until then , avoid .
it was soo greasy and a bit salty .
the sauce was n't really all that great either .
service was not very friendly .
place looks like it needs some tlc .
the pizza was thin , cheesy , and greasy .
it was doughy and not very flavorful .
and their wings are horrible .

_num_ tables being used .
we should still get our dumb $ _num_ off .
so , i will not be going back.
this time was n't so good .
the chicken parm hero is soggy .
this is sad excuse for a restaurant .
she said they would honor the groupon .
lousy service with incompetent employees .
very heavy on the cheese and very little sauce .
i will not be going back here .
needless to say we wo n't be returning .
worst service i 've ever had .
and , they charge for rice .
we walked in , it was busy .
all the food looked fucking miserable .
_num_ minutes later , we get _num_ menus .
what the shit is wrong here ?
tonight makes me want to change my mind .
i walked in and then straight back out .
this location is trash central .
an absolute embarrassment to the company .
this one does not .
but wow the service here is terrible .
i have no idea why i go back .
all around a pretty horrible experience .
big thumbs down to this place .
they only had one waitress running the entire floor .
there was barely any sauce on the strippers .
i 'm really unimpressed .
it still does n't feel right .
not a good way to get your guests back !
he was awesome and trained the other servers .
they 're clearly struggling to find their way .
too many other choices out there .
not sure we 'll be back anytime soon .
sad that this family tradition has faded away .
this place has the worst wings .
according to our server , this happens every monday .
the kitchen just seems to fall apart she says .
this place is poorly managed !
went in to grab some lunch after my haircut .
no one came over or said anything to me .
the drinks were watered down .
the server was horrible .
do n't ever go there it 's horrible .
& then hung up on me .
it 's certainly not because of the staff .
not just once , but several times .
they deserve 4/5 or 5/5 stars .
wow the customer service is super lacking over here .
the remote they gave me came with no batteries .
_num_ bed bug can have _num_ 's of babies .
rude , unhealthy place to stay .
there was nothing for vegetarians .
the food was mediocre at best .
the ambience was better than most .
took forever to get my bill .
weak sauce ... literally .
i ordered the pho veggies and was sadly disappointed .
the food is not good as i expected .
the food is not quite as good as before .
spring rolls - basic - ca n't go wrong ?
but there really is an herb called fish mint .
apparently they do n't serve it with pho .
admittedly , i was not uber friendly either .
it clearly was not an appointment .
he was really just shooting the shit .
there was no apology for the wait time .
there is no excuse for that .
very rude office staff what there is of it .
do n't go see this doctor .
seriously , find somebody else .
the reviews on this page are _num_ % accurate .
do not use these people to finance your vehicle .
i agree stay far far away .
i was n't that impressed .
the only thing decent here is the prices .
what a big fat fail this place is .
there was no heat in either one .
machine # _num_ hot water does n't work !
this place is the absolute worst .
this place totally sucks im going somewhere else .
not user friendly and kind of a scam .
how can you mess up a franchise ?
tater tots are n't too horrid either .
wish i would have just got my money back .
the service here is always super slow .
there is sheer disappointment written on my face .
i live close by .
so we asked them to remake it .
bad business and bad services .
i hope they shut this place down !
teriyaki chicken was nothing special .
curry chicken just was n't good .
almost too big really .
wo n't be coming back here again .
my chicken was so plain .
it was just teriyaki chicken .
hard to mess up .
just dont go for the food .
same as any fast food chinese place .
would not recommend ever !
then the nightmare was to start .
i 've having terrible chest pains and trouble breathing .
_num_ instead of _num_ .

worst hospital experience ever .
horrible experience in _num_ .
i wish i could remember his name .
i do n't even know where to start !
worst experience of my life here !
this place has me fucking furious .
she never came out to the waiting room .
no fucking reason to do what that nurse did .
ridiculously soft and uncomfortable toilet seat is falling off .
this is a hospital .
they just made a quick buck off united healthcare .
sometimes things just never get done .
_num_ strikes and you 're out banner desert !
she was very rude and quick to the point .
they do n't care .
absolutely horrible service treatment !
so i refused the x-ray .
do n't you want your script !
he would get better care at home !
the whole banner system is horrible !
hi kristen - i would like to help .
that was the purpose of the wheel chair .
so that made me wait even longer .
they literally did n't do anything .
just asked me what my pain was from 1-10 .
what a waste of time .
everyone in the waiting room was freaking out .
i seriously hate this hospital .
i rescheduled for 1:30 on a saturday .
the bride and i were kind of put off .
not even an apology or a manager stepping in .
i 'm getting married this october .
a huge waste of my drive .
both left very unhappy with experience .
she is a size _num_ .
it was a good _num_ inches too big !
you ca n't reach a person on the phone .
she was absolutely horrible .
i had a horrible experience with this office .
the concept of time means nothing to this group .
poor service culture here .
dash off to another firm .
first visit here , will not go back .
what an impersonal treatment !
the providers are fine , the staff is horrible .
simply they do not care .
stupid me , i should have moved years ago .
the bacon in my burrito was raw for starters .
there carne asada with more like dog food .
granted , i have been to no whataburger !
and both visits were terrible , in every way .
everyone has bad days .
old , cold and full of mold .

also , she seems like impatient when we order .
roasted duck is mediocre .
i ordered cashew chicken lunch special .

if i could i would give it negative stars .
they said no problem bring them by .
very very disappointed with my whole experience with them .
it looked old and ... not renovated !
no meat or vegetables at all .

another _num_ to get our drinks .
bulgogi : really was n't good at all .

the interior of this restaurant needs a renovation badly .
not worth eating out .
i mean , really ?
the lady told her they have no more potato .
just a bad day today .
i taste nothing but salty overly done chicken meat .
was n't proud of that at all .
the two waitresses were running like crazy .
no booths , uncomfortable tables and chairs .
well , chinese take-out is at least cheap .
rushed me to hospital .
i could n't talk , walk , or function .
absolute worst feeling in the world .
my feeling is that soup was bad .
there are better korean restaurants around .
ca n't be all random .
even main dish is lacking ingredients and no taste .
service is so bad .
crazy place never ever had before .
sever is stupid , only one sever .
also food is tasting so bad .

decent place and people but a little run down .
the quality if beans are terrible .
my general tso 's chicken was pretty nasty !
if i could give negative stars , i would .
they are n't willing to work with you .
they do n't care about their customers .

there is n't any customer service .
avoid at all costs .
bad experience , bad customer service .
our old instructor mr brian was awesome .
after that , quit .
the owner is really rude , worst costumer service .
yes is cheaper , but you deserve better .
maybe this is why he is not so busy .
then tried to charge me more money !
the tux did not fit .
the owner was beyond rude !
incredibly unprofessional and talked bad about his previous customers .
he clearly does not appreciate your hard earned money .
trust me you are better off going anywhere else .
i have been going here for years .
i do n't get this place .
this has gone to the point of absurd .
this is all according to our health care .
the staff that works there are incompetent as well .

however , the ladies up front are terrible .

pillows small and lumpy .
let 's call the maintenance guy ... too late .
i stayed here friday , october _num_ , _num_ .
the motel is old point blank .
it just was n't worth what i spent .
the lighting is not the best either .
but still could use a little more tlc .
i could not access any wifi .
should n't of done it .
we only stayed two nights .
my husband and i were so tired !
the hallway smelled like wet mold !
my room key did n't work .

oranges , apples , bananas .
he said that there was nothing he could do .
not a place i would stay again .
the mold and stains on everything .
iced tea ... no ice .
iced water ... no ice .
no dressing on the salad .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .

i ca n't believe this establishment allows this treatment .
if i could give negative _num_ stars i would .
this place is awful .
apparently most people feel the same .
no water for _num_ hours .
then the a/c went out in our new room .
there is zero customer service .
he said it again with the same nasty tone .
i 'm like ... wtf ?
there is just no excuse for this .
obviously , this place does not wash their sheets .
and that is just foul !
not even a `` can i help you ?
but plan to wait forever for your car .
i did not buy their tire .
i will not shop there again .
i do not recommend you go here .
the food was ok nothing special .
their hollandaise sauce was sooo salty .

the place seems tired .
poached eggs were severely undercooked , muffin was burned .

this place is very unimpressive .
been there twice and food was slow both times .
there was nothing special about my french toast .
the eggs were disgusting , they taste watery .
i did not like it at all .
sure do miss our old good egg .
too bad so sad to say good bye .
also , they no longer do the loyalty cards .
i wo n't eat and pay for cold food .
just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat .
jimmy and joes pizza blows this away .
he was very defensive .
just received cold pizza and under cooked bread sticks .
when i called , they were rude .
the franchise manager never contacted me .
i guess your manager is just not interested .
it definitely depends on what you are looking for .
she has no idea how to listen to patients .
she is the worst dentist i 've ever seen .
procedure was _num_ % more than quoted .
i said no thanks and walked out .
my office all ordered from this awful place .
all the chicken and pork : overdone .
i will not be ordering from here again .
that 's very odd to me .
they did n't need to be typing away .
still no improvement , i see .
none of them seemed used to being handled .
i 'm looking elsewhere .
there is no other way to describe it .
these birds often see no human interaction for days .
worse : employees act like they do n't care .
when we walked in , no one greeted us .
overly crowded is putting it mildly .
no animal should be crowded like that .
they usually will not ask you what you need .
this is not the only bird store in mesa .
i hated every second i lived there .
2nd visit _num_ week later to cast arm .
they did not get a drop of urine .
it gets worse ... .
i 'm torn with this place .
this is where they get _num_ starts .
i could n't believe it .
and they were n't busy , like at all .
i asked for a supervisor and spoke to manuel .
i am so disappointed .
they did not even asked for these symptoms .
i am so utterly appalled by this facility .
no wonder they always run out .
just leaves me feeling frustrated .
line out the door an _num_ people working .
step it up and hire some more people already !
not the dishwasher i 'm talking about .
really they do n't install on the same day !
then tim left me saying he had to leave .
they have one of the worst customer services .
i had two tires replaced on my _num_ honda .
goes off and says let me tell the tech .
this shop in mesa is no different .
stay away from sears auto !
got there on time , dude said _num_ hour .
its a freaking oil change .
it takes _num_ minutes !
there is no sense of urgency there for customers .
i just leave after that .
i paid $ _num_ for it .
unfortunately i wo n't be shopping here .
this is that goodwill .
probably never coming back .
place was way understaffed .
there were no table waitresses .
the wait period is roughly _num_ minutes . ''
do not make it up as you go .
that to me shows poor customers services .
that would 've been wonderful information to have .
the management needs to start training better here .
will not come back .
staff was of poor quality .
even manager was of no help .
never had a problem .
went there today and was treated like garbage .
rent a car from any other place .
absolutely miserable and frustrating experience .
super annoyed at this experience .
$ _num_ for a plain metal key is obnoxious .
the dr looked he was annoyed to treat me .
call back and wait an hour with no response .
not even an email address from their web page .
the worst you can imagine .
could n't even be bothered to look up .
sugar attracts more flies than vinegar .
can i give them _num_ stars ?
i am not going to see the same doctor .
probably the most unprofessional call i 've ever experienced .
she was a bit nicer .
all ra patients are suffering due to his quit .
the staff at this facility is just awful .
we can forward your medical records to them .
this is the worst office to go to .
the staff is unfriendly and unprofessional .
find another dr immediately .
he was as cranky as the _num_ year old .
nobody ever died from being nice .
food was really bland .
however , the service was awful .

but ambiance was not the low spot .
visit # _num_ extremely poor service .
the waitress was rude and obviously poorly trained .
so did not get my soup or salad .
we ate our pies with no drink .
hard to finish without liquid .

chicken fried steak and eggs was my fave .
runny eggs and the steak was pure salt .
she left the receipt without a word .
too bad , losing my favorite morning spot .
very short review , village inn let down today .
this is probably the first time it has happened .
however , no longer will that be the case .
being my birthday i was really craving crepes .
its something i only get on special occasions .
i was really excited to get them .
wait , wait , waiting .
bummer the service is so slow today .
i was in no hurry so i could wait .
my husband refused his sandwich and we left .
the service is pretty slow .
_num_ minutes still no service ... .
literally cold , watery , and with no flavor .
no second chances here .

very poor staff training .

very poor staff training .
chicken was way overlooked .
after all these years the place has gone downhill .

crab puffs were the only good part of meal .

chicken marsala needed more sauce and mushrooms .
it was too late to order anything else .
not good food or service for the prices .
what a crap experience !
i spoke too soon .
i walked out without being so much as greeted .
never bring your pet to this place .
anyway neither of us will be going back .
anyway neither of us will be going back .
they have no respect for you or your pet .
not even one once of good advice .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
this place is empty for a reason .
first of all , every single barber is slow .
or maybe we 're the idiots .
do not go here to get your haircut .
i suggest albertsons for all meat purchases .
she lacks personality and a tiny customer service smile .
i dread picking up prescription from her .
cheap breakfast that is mediocre .
the service is mediocre .
just ordered _num_ pies for thanksgiving .
upon entering the restaurant i had a bad feeling .
no thinly sliced prime rib and no mushrooms .
the check was n't even brought to the table .
nobody knew how to run the cash register .
pies were the worst i 've ever eaten .
crunchy and not ripe whatsoever .
we all got sick from it .
i will never return to this establishment .
the muffin came out quickly and was decent .
the steak was horribly fatty .
she acknowledged that it did not look fresh .
she squeezed out an apology .
the service completely sucked !
i was extremely offended .
they did not call me to let me know .
so i left my scheduled appointment with no massage .
i signed online to schedule an appt .

if you want deep tissue , book him .
i will never go to this massage envy again !

i will not be back .
i run up to the door and ... .
chipped and missing concrete as you walk up .
they are not parent friendly !
there are no female trainers at all .
_num_ months , nothing has changed .
i was disappointed that there were no weekend hours .
things get fixed fairly quickly .
there is usually a wait , especially in winter .
bland , overpriced , and nothing special .
unfortunately it was n't .
disappointing especially since were were the first table today .
but this time the salad was not good .
along with , the chicken alfredo was missing something .
but not great to me .
strike _num_ the brown ass breadsticks that tasted burnt .
maybe they would 've been better .
he did n't seem to care .
this was a crappy experience .
we will not go back .
service wasnt all that great this time .

the tiramisu was gross .

this is very bland , americanized mexican food .
this place looks very dirty .

does that also mean not good ?
the food is just too sub-par .
there is nothing here that you want .
ordered _num_ chicken dishes .
could not eat anything that i ordered .
ca n't believe they stay in business .
waste of time and money .
the pants were replaced on the spot .
you ca n't button your jacket properly without it !
we began looking at ties , still no greeting .
save your time and money and try another location .
they did n't seem to pick up at that .
no stars from me !
here is where it gets bad .
do you really need to be that desperate ?
only myself and one other customer were there .
these associates are not even at & t trained .
yelp says it opens at 9am .

maybe it 's just me , but gross .
the answer was still no .
i 'm really not sure how much he heard .

the staff is much friendlier at barry 's too .
bad business all around !
this is a place to stay away from .
i miss fiesta mall .
bubbles of joy is lame .
it was not busy at all .
i waited one minute and nothing .
sorry , but not a fan .
overall i would not recommend this place .
this place is so crowded .
they just replaced the lens with the same script .
the hours clearly say they open at nine .
valentine 's day is not a national holiday .
the staff is the worst part .
they treated me horribly .
they do a horrible job of picking up garbage .
things i never thought would happen , happened .
my advice would be to just not do it .
no cleanliness is applied here .
worst manicure and pedicure experience i have ever had .
i will not have them back !
this was an $ _num_ job !
they wo n't even respond to my emails .
_num_ minutes roll by .
then _num_ minutes later , we get our food .
did n't bother us as much as our burger .
jalapeno poppers ( _num_ ) had a bitter taste .
and a friend of mine .
so they scammed me but whatever !
do not visit this location !
the food is extremely inconsistent .
but i 'm not going to expect quality .
we probably wo n't be back .
so sad cause we like sonic .
this is the worst sonic i have been to .
i only got a medium strawberry limeade .
dumped it all out and found lettuce in it .
i 'm never coming back here again .
one word for this place - nasty .
worst hamburgers in mesa period !
that 's assuming waste my money at another sonic .
this location will never get my business again .

the worst experience i have ever had anywhere .
pressed the button no response for _num_ more minutes .
what the actual hell .
tater tots are very cold and very old .
diet coke was flat .
my burger was n't fully cooked , 3/4 pink .
i most likely will not return here .
we arrived around 9:30 a.m. to find empty shelves !
avoid this place at all costs .
sadly , this was the past .
thanks , never would have noticed it otherwise .
now do n't get me wrong .
i found this rude ... and annoying !

the dog sat on her lap while they ate .
this place deserves zero stars .
it was very disappointing .
our bill came to $ _num_ including tip .
sorry but we will not be back .
worst place ever if you 're pregnant .
refuses to make sushi for pregnant women .
at this point , we both lost our appetite .
also there is not enough room around the tables .
then businesses wonder why they are going under .
it tasted like plain ol ' chocolate ice cream .
it was not just hot , but tasted bad .
i visited the location on gilbert and southern tonight .
the place smelled and was dirty .
the food was over priced and tasted bland .
the concrete was okay , nothing special .
this is place will close down before to long .

i waited _num_ minutes for my drink .
i will not be coming back here .
horrible experience at this starbucks , all around .

what a waste of time .
you are a horrible company !
even machines that work could use maintenance .
come to find out they never canceled the membership .
equipment is old dirty .
to gold 's , no .
( insulting another gym ) .
quite possibly the worst gold 's gym ever .
the layout of the place is terrible , too .
this gym only cares about its numbers .
these places are not exceptional at all .
how about the $ _num_ minimum to get in ?
way overpriced , extreme unhealthy food choices ?
or sitting through 20-30 mins of ads ?
the sound was n't impressive .
the staff that was there that day was horrible .
they do n't move and are super uncomfortable .
their 3d movies seem to be outrageously priced .
probably the last time we visit an amc theater .
ok ... jim ... then asked why ?
because , i frankly do n't !
afternoon after _num_ pm is outrageous .
very poor customer service .
took _num_ minutes to get a ticket and popcorn .
no more than _num_ people came i or out .
wo n't be going back .

probably the worst seats i 've ever sat in .
my back is still killing me .
smaller theater , late showing .
the movie volume was very low for some reason .
ticket and concession service slow .
not at those prices .
there was nobody there on a friday night .
we wo n't be going back .
they are not friendly to bigger people .
i rarely ever use another theater , until now .
i ca n't even leave it down .
no line , no rush to purchase tickets .
sad that i would have to do that .
no apologies or offers to correct their mistake .
such bad customer service at the framing desk .
simply put , they were a customer service disaster .
horrible customer service at this location .
she was acting so inappropriate it was insane !
w walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too .
the shrimp skewer was overcooked .
they were dry and had very little flavor .
the breading was very heavy and over done .
in all , skip it .
very disappointed and we wo n't be back !
we ignored them , but probably should have listened .
there is no coleslaw .
ca n't a girl get a coleslaw around here ?
it took another _num_ minutes to get my coleslaw .
my husband 's steak and prawns were weak .
overall our only positives were the side salads .
our server was pleasant but very slow .
inspect your gear thoroughly before leaving the shop .
the pastry was stale and hard and lacked flavor .
too bad not one was at the restaurant !
nothing was wilted or sour .
the fruit was in good shape , too .
rolls or bread was pitiful .
can i not have a whole bread stick ?
the people in this store are incredibly rude .
this walgreens literally deserves zero stars .
oh well then just do n't bother coming here .
officially switching over to another pharmacy .
the customer service is so poor .
nope you 're made to feel like an inconvenience .
our waitress was unfriendly and all business .
no personality at all .
it 's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it .
i took one bite and was done .
i recommend getting the chicken marsala though .
second , the service was terrible .
and finally , the food is terrible .
what a waste of time and money .
what a rip-off for $ _num_ !
while the food was decent the service was horrible .
i 'm not sure i 'd ever go back .
dont waste your time , or money .
this place is mediocre at best .
i should n't have to ask for refills .
the food is only ok .
it seems so unsanitary .
it was positively dripping in pesto cream sauce .
really , really unpleasant .
overall a huge disappointment .
i will not go back there again .
talk about overpriced and not very good .
i would never go back to this place .
sorry ; wish it was more exciting .
ha food was good service horrible .
now i remember why i do n't come here .
if that was the case , i would have .
not a very good take out experience .
would not suggest take out from buca .
i wo n't be back .
chicken parm was bland .
the waiter brought our drinks and some house bread .
we had the chicken parmesan , which was good .
spend your money elsewhere on a better italian food .
_num_ ) food quality is awful .
_num_ ) the decor of the store is horrendous .
worse than the food .
dont spend your money in this chain .

restaurant felt dirty and definitely lack luster .
weird sewer smell and dusty everywhere .
unfortunate because it used to be pretty good .

i am going to cook burgers .

it is a sure fire disaster .
this place is dirty and the food was horrible .
they probably would n't pass a health department inspection .
the pasta and chicken dishes were bland and tasteless .
it is processed crap .
plus the alfredo sauce was laughable .
very , very disappointed .
their desserts are just stupid large .
the chicken parm is inconsistent from visit to visit .
horrible `` food '' !
took one bite and knew instantly it was frozen .
it 's not very clean or organized .
most petsmart 's are the same unfortunately .
she is almost _num_ yr old .
so that visit was so-so .
there should be for groomers as well .
banfield costumer service is terrible .
no care or compassion at all .
never dealing with petsmart again .
they 've really gone downhill in recent years .
the _num_ was only $ _num_ more .
was petsmart taken over by new ownership ?
did petsmart forget they have competition ?
my waitress said no .
i will not be back .
the restaurants are always crowded and very loud .
they are always fall of the bone tender .
also , their wait is never bad .
wish i had my $ _num_ back .
oh , get rid of the cinnamon butter .
the big problem were the ribs for me .
not the worst but i have definitely seen better .
although , the group selected afterwards were seated promptly .
the vegetable serving was completely overcooked .
this is my 3rd bad experience at this location .
idiots cant cook a steak to save their lives .
it looked like it might have been dropped .
this is my 3rd bad experience at this location .
a big no no on restaurant nightmares .
they would not seat my girlfriend until i arrived .
salad had too much dressing on it .
my prime rib was just ok .
worst customer service by a manager !
does n't value paying customers !
tonight was one of those nights .
ate it all , then came the entree .
no one got their steaks cooked correctly .
she sent gets back .
this restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds .
sorry , texas roadhouse .
no free food , no nothing .
needless to say we went somewhere else .
the appetizers took _num_ minutes to get to us .
if it was super busy i would have understand .
i will not be coming back to texas roadhouse .
the green beans i simply did n't like .
they were also too salty to eat .
it was just salty corn in salty oily liquid .
i would not recommend the texas roadhouse to friends .
customer service is lacking .
when she brought them , they were cold again .
the service last night was very disappointing .
i ended up cleaning with a wet napkin .
the mashed potatoes were cold also .
the butter corn was luke warm .
it did n't work out that way however .
our waiter had the personality of a cardboard box .
save yourself the frustration and hassle .
it 's after _num_ , dang .

no call no credit !
leaving this month to poor service .
customer service from courtney and amanda are horrible .
in other words most of the food was cold .

they could do no wrong in my eyes .
if possible , i would have rated no stars .

spend a little more money and stay somewhere else .
this place is gross , and smelly .
this place is disgusting to say the least !
the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned .
however , the beds were comfy .
he listened , looked at all photos .
no stars should be given !

i 'm not a fan of buffets .

the clam chowder was ok .
this place does n't have much to choose from .

the food smells bad and looks even worse .
even my boys who all love food barely ate .
so disappointing for how much we paid !
threw was no white meat fried or baked chicken .
the turkey was not worth the wait .
unfortunately , they may never be able to return .
-the maze is gigantic .
the arcade is small and the food is terrible .

he did this literally _num_ times .
tonight was definitely not their night .
bathrooms are a mess .

he yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful .
cream cheese sushi = not cool .
did not get what we ordered .
i do not recommend to anyone .
the bread seemed old and tasted stale .
finally their fries were a disappointment .
the inside trash was overflowing .
the food though , is not so fantastic .
both tasted deep fried , which is totally weird .
for the cost , i felt cheated .
honestly , i will not go here again .
my biggest beef the music was ridiculously loud !
that was the only good thing about this place .
they were dry , over done and cold .
first , no fresh fish menu .
pretty fishy , but that is to be expected .
the cooked dishes were forgettable , but not terrible .
ok ; here is my input .
every watch that chef on iron chef ?
it was a huge disappointment .
however , all where average to poor .
one of the servers barely spoke any english .
none of us ordered sushi .
no one was complementary about their meal .
the sushi did not taste very good .
it was only about a few tables busy .
poor guy was so tired of waiting .
she quickly said sorry but not very sincerely .
will not go back .
i 'd rather go to tempura sushi bar instead .
i will never go their again !
this place sucks will not suggest to anyone !

ugh f me and my burrito cravings .
neither one was anything special .
the salsa bar was a mess .
tables were a mess .
i wo n't be going back .
a veggie burrito for example is _num_ calories .
i will not be returning .
it was just okay , but not great .
never eating there again after this ... gross !
could this place be anymore crowded ?
even then there is no order to checking out .
bad check out experiences every time i come here .
but today was exceptionally bad .
anyone else ripped off by them ?
do not give them any of your money !
next time i will take my new dog elsewhere .
ill never take my dog to this location again !
this place is ridiculous .
i waited for _num_ minutes before walking out .
if you go , have the bread and leave !

just blah in my opinion ... .
tonight we dined on pasta and ass .
the food was completely bland .
my pasta came burnt ( crispy noodles ! )
skip this place for sure !
this was n't a horrible dining experience .
probably closer to a _num_ star .
but it certainly was n't fantastic .
it just was n't great .
never saw the manager to check on us .
walked in at _num_ on a friday night .
had to wait _num_ minutes anyway .
and should have been served warm .
the stuffed mushrooms were just boring .

too bad they had no flavor .
it was such a shame .
the sale is scheduled to close mid _num_ .
well tonight was not a good experience .
in fact , it sucked .

it was totally bland .
we could n't get out of there fast enough .
when we left the place was virtually empty .
drinks were never refilled .
no water was ever refilled .
service is poor and food quality is just okay .

our drinks arrived _num_ minutes after that .
now , this crap is garbage .
this one is garbage and their food sucks .
first clue , very slow service .
apps were n't bad .
entrees were at best terrible .
my side of spaghetti was cold .
not just not hot or warm , cold .
it was like eating wet cardboard .
the parmesan crusted chicken salad .
that is just inexcusable .
after our order was taken everything was terrible .
tables throughout were left dirty and disgusting .
let me stress i will never be back .
this was rude and ridiculous .
thanks for nothing and for charging us .
they 're doing nothing but losing money .
cold food and indifferent service .
not a fan of panda express .
portion size very little at this panda .
panda express , i wish i could quit you !
same thing happened the last time i was here .
do not eat at this location .

too many options in this area .
let me take a bite ... ... is that ?
waiter : `` well thats our sauce .
me : `` no .
it isnt just tomato .
but the customer service is awful .
i will not be going back .
waste of time , but fine .
is this some sort of sick joke ?
she was so rude !
my experience here has been horrible .
i have adopted a few dogs before .
i was a little irritated at this point .
that 's not the issue .
took ten minutes to be greeted by wait staff .
would n't be surprised if this one closed soon .
avoid this location at all costs .
odd , i thought this was grilled shrimp .
( its _num_ degrees outside today . )
i left a _num_ tip and we left .
the phone call did not go well .

overall , completely terrible .

all around a disappointing visit .
but today our service was beyond horrible .
do not eat here .
our waiter was n't attentive at all .
ordered dinner for _num_ adults and _num_ child .
cup of soup was barely warm ... .
this is not a well run location .
only because i ca n't give it _num_ stars .
sat for _num_ minutes , nobody greeted us .
and our service was slow .
very disappointed in chilis .
this entire meal was so not worth it .
i ordered catering twice this week at this location .
this location was messy , unorganized and unapologetic .
and the food sucked !
i wo n't go back .
i stood around for awhile .
so i ended up buying a more expensive model .
does n't office max deal in computers ?
this store is not organized well .
complete waste of time .
i just know i 'm not shopping there again .
was there the night of may _num_ .
poor customer service was an understatement for this store .
again , with a very rude tone .
she did n't even apologized .
worst coffee and service ever .
i 'm running out of starbucks to go to .
wo n't be back .
this business just lost my business .
third strike and they 're out .
hey , it 's not his fault .

mean employees that were literally yelling at drivers .
very disappointed in wash results .
worst car wash i 've ever had !

i was charged $ _num_ for the oil change .
that 's not what i asked for .
left the broken piece just sitting there .

they tried hard sale upgrades from the jump .
and they backed off .
do n't u wipe the interior ?
oil change guys , not so much !
worst so called wash ever !
no call that it was finished .
they did a terrible job !

it took our server _num_ minutes to tell us .
i ordered the ribeye special .
and it was crap .
this place sucks ... service is the worst ever !
the service that was once so amazing , sucked .
i will not be going back .
should n't he be worried ?
draft beers were n't even cold .
not impressed one bit .
they seem to be accommodating to the handicapped though .
we had dinner here last night and were disappointed .
he did not return with a cloth or anything .
did not even eat left ruining our night .
find another place to get your wings .
it was n't horrible but it was strange .
they got _num_ pizzas wrong .
hot and ready pizza ?
not at this location .
calling ahead does n't help either .
oh , wait ... .
unless it 's late at night .
do n't walk , run from these apartments .
my apartment was not clean when i moved in !
the place is a shit hole .
run down , everything is out dated .
but anything that came from the office was garbage !
this place is nothing more then a hotel _num_ !
would not recommend them to anyone .
so i ordered the tacos at $ _num_ each .
i ordered _num_ de pastor and _num_ of lengua .
i really did n't like the tacos .

the staff was as friendly as could be .
it was a sunday , people were chatting .

$ _num_ no way !
way to much money for that !
most likely i will not be returning !
very disappointed in the customer service i received .
it seems like common sense to me .
not a pleasant experience this saturday morning .
this monday i found my car is dripping oil .
i can not believe that .
i 'm sorry , but wtf .
there 's no service .
maybe a return visit on a tuesday in july .
toppings are only done in 1/2 .
the pizza is not even worth eating , imo .
the beer and wine is cheap .
and then they cheated on the toppings too .
but the food is terrible .
the food is not good .
it could be a little awkward .
i did n't know you could screw that up .
the pizza was mediocre at best .
the room was crowded .
his entire arm was covered in american flag tattoos .
wait staff at the front counter were awful !
not kid friendly in menu choices @ drink counter .
pizza is below average & over priced .
the organ is the obvious highlight .
the pizza was n't bad .
let me just say this was not my thing .
( wow , possibly worst description ever .
peter piper pizza has better food than this place .
there was no redeeming quality in anything we ordered .
i wo n't be back .
plus the way you order is a mess .
the pizza was some weird and mixture of blah .
unfortunately , it 's not always enough .
the food is overpriced and very sub-par .
but again ... not worth it .
not allowed to wait in the building at all .
queens pizza and the waitstaff was awesome .
wait in another line to order your drinks .
sad to have a musician get a power trip .
it was n't worth the noise and the people .
not going back , i think .
this management company is horrible .
dead plants are not being replaced .
needed _num_ buttons on a shirt .
there is no sense of customer service at all .
the clean up service outside is horrible !
the maintenance was nice but lazy .
this place is horrible !
biggest mistake ive ever made .
nothing in our apartment is updated .
they were talking poorly of customers .
i do not recommend this store .
there is tolerable people there .
wo n't be going back .
now not one good item !
_num_ items should get you at least $ _num_ !
the store was n't even packed either !
they do n't even deserve _num_ star !
either way i 'm not returning !
we left our _num_ dogs here june _num_ .
that did n't sit well with us .
very disrespectful and rude .
i would n't send my worst enemy there .

the front desk staff are very disorganized .
if i could leave no stars , i would !
i hate this place !
i left a terrible review .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
worst health care facility i have ever been to .
i have no heat until wednesday .
owner is not willing to do anything about it .
i 'm very disappointed .
i would give this _num_ stars if i could .
however , not so much .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
i spoke too soon .
he said it was a _num_ dollar job .
avoid at all costs .
her sense of urgency is very poor .
whatever your bag is , they can make it .
the 1st time i ate here .
my friends chicken strips tasted like sausage .
the strips were replaced with chicken tasting chicken .
they gave me guacamole in a small paper cup .
my friend noticed that i got the wrong size .
next time i will spend more money .
i will never ever return to this whataburger !
the food is n't too bad for bar food .
that 's where it goes down hill .
the wait staff there favors the larger groups .
he 's like there 's no fee .
wish i could give no stars .
made me feel sick to my stomach .
it 's definitely not for the younger scene .
the darts do n't stick and are broken .
they just take up room .
this still does n't excuse them for selling crap .
even the ingredients were terrible .
low quality bread cheese n pepperoni .

drab location in an unassuming strip mall .
service was mediocre at best !
we had teriyaki chicken , katsu , and fish .
the fish tasted like egg .
i gave this place _num_ stars .
however , i was quite disappointed with my visit .

it 's just not for me .
ate here today and had combo # _num_ .
teriyaki chicken was quite burnt and hard .
beef was tough and bland .
wo n't go there again .
we really did n't find this place appealing .
there was confusion about their menu .
neither , apparently , is their printed menu .
the chicken katsu was decent .
way over priced for this nasty meal .
do n't waste your money .
ok , way too much for breakfast .
there was n't enough cinnamon either .
it was so wet and disgusting .
probably just all of my bad luck !
i do n't get it .
the food was bland and meh .
the waitress was slow to take our order .
i got the spinach , mushroom and bacon omelet .
it was dry and hardly buttered .
to start , service was not very good .
waiter was not attentive .
maple syrup is n't even available !
they have 4-5 employees standing at the register talking ?
just ate there this morning .
had the country fried steak and biscuits and gravy .
not impressed at all .
food is super bland and terrible quality !
did n't you write my order down ?
for the price i would expect much better quality .
very unprofessional and inappropriate .
that is no way to treat customers .
this was one where it missed the mark .
my eggs were perfectly hard poached .
no yellow lava , but a yellow stone .
it was a disappointing morning to start the day .
sorry crackers , try again .
eggs came out tiny and overcooked .
and will never return here again .
i wish i was told this upon arrival .
honestly nothing to write home about .
spent more time waiting than eating .

the restaurant on the other hand is horrible !
but even worse , bed bugs .

the worst service ever .
the manager is a complete racist .
this branch is disgusting and sad .
the food is just ok with almost no selections .

wish i had gone with a different company .
ill be going that way from now on .
the tires still have not even moved still .
we are having our 1st baby .
nothing like rushing on our big day .
she talked me through the whole process .
everytime i would go they had someone new .
it was the generic computer voice .
every phone i used reached my phone .
will not be doing business with them again .
he was rude and very condescending .
( _num_ th and camelback ) .
it will save lots of money and hassle .
five of the last six sundays have been missed .
terrible , terrible experience !
the worst marketing company i have ever worked with .

we will never step foot into this establishment again !
because the quality of menu items is very poor .

the restaurant gives a real tired appearance .

they clearly do n't care about customers .
they clearly do n't care about customers .
the selections however were horrible .
rude customer service and always dirty .
took me three employees to get them adjusted properly .

however my past two visits had errors though .
got my money back for the groupon .
i would n't go there if it was free .
the waits here are way too long .
they did n't seem to care very much .
and that 's too many fails for me .
and service is not so good .
this place was a complete rip off .
the groupon covered $ _num_ of the service .
the extra $ _num_ was due to tax .
my windshield had absolutely no damage whatsoever on it .
it was a hard , hard sell .
talk about a bad first impression !
ill stick to do it yourself places .
i was then rushed from the premises .
they did a horrible job .
do not go to this place !
so why exactly is he standing there again ?
then come back to get my car washed .
he said $ _num_ dollars with tax .
well the oil change was a disaster .
i have been highly disappointed with this car wash !
she quoted me _num_ over the phone .
no one called in sick today .

i went inside to wait for my car .
she said very rudely that it was marked .
i then looked over the whole car .
i told him it was only an ok job .
she told me it would n't be a problem .
why are small children allowed into the workout area ?
no way , not with me !
the front desk staff is not friendly at all .
i feel management needs to train their staff better .
also , the spin classes on sat are ridiculous !
i could not even tell you who management is .
but _num_ hours a day every day ?
the cardio machines here suck , plain and simple .
so , customer service ?
i 'd hate working here , too .
this staff is horrible and not courteous whatsoever .
they do n't care they only want your money .
an obvious safety concern .

the cashier ( asian lady ) was very rude .
i will never spend another penny at this place .
the taco plate was skimpy and bland .
maybe try a burrito instead ?
one word : disappointing .
the guacamole was a bit thinner than i like .
i was n't willing to wait this time .
again , no offer to make it right .
i should have just asked for my money back .
i 'm really disappointed .
my husband was not impressed with his carnitas burrito .
the place was clean and the staff was friendly .
seriously , rice and beans are a staple .
really bad service and mediocre food .
i do n't understand crappy rude service .
no thanks or eye contact again .
had a carne asada burro with beans no rice .
but that should n't excuse poor service .
she also never apologized for their terrible customer service .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
not pleasurable at all .
however , last sunday i placed a phone order .

and for one taco it apparently cost $ _num_ .
a sorry about that would have gone along way .

longer for drinks to be delivered .
there are many places nearby that would be better .
we will not be back .

she did n't even offer to comp the meal .
i was never contacted by management .
however the wait staff sucks !
when i asked for another beverage he walked away .

the managers are just so rude .
it seems like they hate their job .
reason why i prefer to go to sephora !

complete and utter disappointment .
and they give you one sauce for _num_ tacos .
i wo n't make that mistake again .
the churros were old and dry .
to date there has been no response .
typical greasy , low quality mexican food .

i am not exaggerating either .
only good when drunk really .
overall food quality for me is poor .
despite my bad first trip , i went back .
stood out side the window for almost _num_ minutes .
this location is horrible .
however two weeks ago no problem .
they just do n't seem to have it together .

i was clueless as to what that was .
the rudest front desk staff you ever could hire .

i tried really hard to like this place .
my boyfriend did n't like any of it either .
the pesto was lacking flavor .

you made them very unhappy .
the service standards have gone downhill quite a bit .
their food is mediocre at best but ridiculously overpriced .
crispy bacon is is critical though for this dish .

the meat was weird .
it 's a bummer that it was a bomb .
the service was pretty terrible too .
i probably wo n't be back any time soon .

the worst was the linguini in white clam sauce .
very poor execution on both dishes .
dessert was a complete let down for me .
never gon na go there again .
i was told i could leave by _num_ .
this place is a nightmare .
chandler urgent care said this is their billing practice .
i would advice everyone to not use these facilities .
nothing urgent about this place .

if i could give zero stars , i would .
avoid this hospital if you can .
but i have no insurance .
the visit continued to be awful .
but , no ... .
this place was disgusting !
the ed leaves a lot to be desired .
my baby and i were put under unnecessary stress .
i wish i could remember her name .
my experiences with chandler have not been too great .
just wait until you leave and get your bill .
then all hell breaks loose .
of course he refused .
when my other the son was sick .
so , prove that nurse wrong .
chandler regional is not a great er .
they are a horrific er .

just my $ _num_ .
worst experience at a hospital ever .
the nursing staff is incompetent .
would not go back to this er .
super ridiculous long waits .

my mom stayed behind because jasmine was scared .
we left and will not be back .
i no longer trust chandler hospital .
these dr 's and nurses are not properly trained .
i have never seen such a poorly run hospital .
but overall staff is horrible .
they do n't check in .
i checked in to get treatment for this issue .
this was just to charge more money .
worst hospital experience ever !
staff unfriendly and the wait time is unbearable !
the worst hospital i have ever been to .
if i could give it zero stars i would !
signed one very unhappy mom !
the lab results showed nothing of the sort .
why would a er doctor lie to us ?
be warned do not ever come here .
they told me if symptoms got worse come back .
she said well then just get more pain meds .
i went to chandler regional hospital with my mother .
shame so close to getting five stars .
zero stars for her .

the food is gross and they are way understaffed .
the b wing of the hospital is the worst !
the cafeteria is a big disappointment and is filthy .
wait out turn in er .
at this time it 's not as bad .
he spent twenty minutes in pain waiting for room .
here 's my edit to add on .
but here goes another review .
i have no complaints with the er .
never did get a wash bowl and soap .
the nurse took over and had no trouble .
very disappointed with the hospital .
the dr refused to do it .
what a waste of time and money .
stay away from this hospital .
the room was incredibly small .
nothing else so i was like ok ?
i was not impressed with their management either .
she seemed to care less and wasted my time .
do not waste your time .
really horrible , and sad .
nothing seems fresh and the flavors are very weak .
heard its closed , not surprised .
sorry , this place closed about a year ago !
do n't go here unless you have to .
if you have any options go elsewhere .
i knew this was going to be ugly .
felt awkward and uncomfortable .
the scheduling staff and management are very rude .
that office is complete shit .
i have had the very worst experience with them .
would not help me at all .
i really hate this place .
do n't waste your time or money here .
it 's been a nightmare .
and , this dental assistant was very rude .
horrible , horrible experience .
they just filled my mouth full of holes .
save yourself , stay away from these people .
they blamed my doctor so i called him .
they wo n't put me on hold .
secondly they do n't have their insurance down .
under staffed under trained and over worked .
cold cheap domestic beer in a strip mall dive .
if i could give no stars , i would .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the booze is watered down !
i am not making this up .
still the same well garbage .
i have been drinking crown for _num_ years .
she is just the worst .
i would rather hang out with my ex wife .
and the hotel would not be covered .
they stated pet stains on the carpet .
worse property company ever .
do not go to this company for anything !
unfortunately , that changed recently with new owners .
tonight , that all changed .
i wo n't be going back .
general tso 's chicken i 'll miss you .
the chicken was just so , blah .
no complaints on that part .
will never be ordering from them again .
disappointed in the war wonton soup .
normally this is my go to place for chinese .
very , very bland .
maybe they just gave up .
not great but better for sure .
i am wasting my time going any further .
i wish i had n't ordered already .
so this was not an isolated incident .
i had to rush right home and shower !
the loud music on the weekend is annoying .
the food is too bland for me .
it tastes like diet food .
made the mistake of sitting on the patio once .
one of the worst hummus plates ive ever tasted .
service was slow but the overall atmosphere was okay .
it was too dry .
after _num_ minutes of that , we left .
same setup as all the other pita jungle restaurants .
staff sucks , except for the hostess .
i could n't believe it .
sad face for howard , beef gyro for me .
no , not yet .
do n't expect to be wowed too much .
_num_ star for the horrible to go service .
well pita jungle is consistent -- on horrible service .
sorry , try again .
so we avoid it like the plague .
or maybe my waitress just sucked .
then why does the menu state it has guacamole ?
that , i believe , is completely unacceptable .
the funny thing was that the restaurant was empty .
oh and do n't get those garlic potatoes .
my family was seriously running away from me .
i suggest going there instead !
she said she would let someone know .
ruined it for me .
a little disappointed since i was expected better .
bartender however was very unprofessional .
last time , it was missing the cucumbers .
my least favorite pita jungle location throughout the valley .
wont be visiting this location again .
thanks for serving me rotten artichoke .
this place is either great or horrible .
and doesnt assure me it will never happen again .
no kidding they are not all rotten .
i have to wonder why we bother coming back .
the service is hit or miss .
she quickly responded , `` oh yes .
she was so rude .
and the manager on duty was not nice either .
even the manager was terrible .
do n't eat here .
no consistency at this restaurant and horrible employees !
good food but the worst service on the planet .
i wo n't be back .
it was soaked in grease and soggy .
the meat was also dry overcooked .
i love pita jungle !
but this location was such a disappointment .
probably wo n't go again .
hummus was not good .
they have messed up my delivery _num_ times !
is it true there is a _num_ beer limit ?
my meal took _num_ minutes .
i have never seen deep fried home fries before .
biscuits + white sausage gravy should = delicous .
the food filled the void but had no flavor .

$ _num_ coupon for a feast .
i lost it and started laughing .

it just says you do but you do n't .
the food ended up being nasty .
probably one of the worst meals ive ever had .

was not appealing at all .
i replied umm no thanks im almost done .
she did n't apologize .
the loaded baked potatoe was so dry and stiff .
it took way too long .
nothing helpful or polite .
do n't waste your time going here .
why is my package in another state ?
boy was i wrong .
the coffee is worse .
and the prices are more expensive .
unfortunately the management at coffee rush kills the experience .
wi-fi is n't really free .
i thought the coffee was average at best .
and he is racist .
i just picked up my stuff and left .
it is loud and uncomfortable inside .
sorry , but i 've experienced better .
cons : coffee is ok nothing special .
no attempted hand washing or anything .
the music is way too loud to read .
friendly barista but the place is dirty and rundown .
the staff here was rude , almost like annoyed .
the wifi is useless as well .
needless to say i left without a coffee .
unimpressed with the customer service at this location .
i will not be returning to this establishment .
customer service has gone down hill !
that is not how customer service works !
how tacky and rude can you be ?
i will not go back to this coffee house .
first off : the coffee stinks .
but no : it was styrofoam .
it was very unprofessional .
nothing better than anywhere else .
stick to coffee bean just a mile away .
_num_ strikes and your out .
strike _num_ : very slow wifi .
not sure why they would allow all that smoking .
in addition the quality of the coffee is disappointing .
too sweet and did not taste like coffee .
i just did n't want one right now .
i regret leaving them a tip .
unfortunately not a nice one .
it 's the most ridiculous thing ever !
i regret going here !
they 're cheap , i 'll give them that .
this makes pei wei look gourmet .
how is this place getting all these positive reviews ?
no draft mex beers .
the atmosphere was kinda of weird .
dont waste ur $ .
so completely overpriced for just your standard mexican fare .
my experience was far from positive .
that is also unacceptable .
after all of this , the food was sub-par .
still `` not feeling it .
this restaurant was not a _num_ by any means .
the salsa was nothing special .
the food was mediocre .
i would not visit this place again .
there are way better mexican restaurants .
the food was ... bland , and boring .
this was my number _num_ choice for dinner .
not a fan so unfortunately i left empty handed .
no booze ; just two iced teas .
the rellenos were soggy , and very little spice .
what a bust , skip it .
it not worth the money .
there no heart or passion in the food .
this place is awful !
dirty and poor management and customer service !
nothing to write home about .
the enchilada sauce was basically just tomato sauce .
i could n't even finish it .
very americanized , bland , `` mexican '' food .
but tonight , not so great .
everything was slow tonight .
the food was mediocre but the drinks were good .
the rice had absolutely no flavor whatsoever .
i really like the salsa selections with the chips .
so the appointment system does not work !
not happy at all .
it was not relaxing at all .
it just does n't make any sense .
there was no account for cox corporate .
avoid at all costs if you can .
cox is getting out of hand with their fees .
now i have to fix up their mess .
if i could give no stars i would .
do not get cox phone service .
do not get cox phone service .
not helpful at all .
i do not recommend cox services to anyone .
customer service is a joke .
you guessed it , no installer showed .
turns out the salesperson did n't order the install .
i had better service with direct tv .
no help at all - i gave up .
it was very expensive , but he seemed competent .
instead he offered me a deal on another suit .
there 's nothing special about this place .
very disappointed , will never return .
again , i explained i just needed a hem .
no apology given after the mess .
first , measurements we 're off .
in fact , the owner was down right arrogant .
it 's a shame that rudeness ruins a business .
after today i refuse to go back .
when we walked in there was no greeting .
clearly she did not need our business .
none of the social media pages reflect this .
it 's a shame because i wasted a trip .
this charge is a bit off the charts .
no wonder doctors make so much money .
not worth the money .
will not be going back !
never going to go back !
are you freaking kidding me ?
we left very unsatisfied !
chunky but not spicy !
a mexican place that doesnt serve hot salsa ?
thats some crap you see at taco bell !
walked in and several people were eating the menudo .
so i added more crushed chili and salt .
yup , i was very disappointed .
not smokey like burnt taste .
but it was made to taste smokey .
my tea was horrible .
i give this place thumbs down !
they could never get my tires balanced .
they do not even stand behind they 're work .
paid _num_ dollars to machine the rotors .
i would not recommend this location !
sorry brake masters , get better or get gone .
this company offers very poor customer service .
i did n't break it _num_ .
because brake masters wo n't give that .
i will not be returning to this location .
i just want to be healthy .
every time i show up to my doctors appt .
overall the experience here has been rough .
the call never comes .
the worst experience i ever had .
just the worst experience from this doctors office !
this is the only office i have visited .
i was not even late to my appt .
convenient location but not recommended .
medications not delivered on schedule .
well we were very wrong !
the food is gross !
she hated this place .
stick with the dim sum .
was the service rude and uncaring ?
dinner here was much better .
dim sum is pretty bad .
service is not that good too .
maybe it was the coconut bread .
anyway , i ate that happily .
it 's not because of their foods .
what a shame on them .
it was all pretty bland .
on a whim , tried it again .
i thought , what the hell is that ?
so beware of that and do n't tip !
at the moment , i doubt it .
ew do n't ever eat dim sum over here .
avoid on weekdays if you want dim sum !
why the _num_ stars ?
and you wait forever for refills .
did n't expect to eat in _num_ degree weather .
receptionist has horrible attitude .
the sauce was runny and not spicy .
overall , just not really worth it .
it looks like it is falling apart .
it was just bad .
sorry i wo n't be back .
all the dim sum was a very poor quality .
it tasted and the texture was very cheap ingredients .
the food was greasy and tasteless .
the quail came out next , completely dry .
but crispy , anyway .
so for regular entrees , this place is ok .
i used to love coming here for dim sum .
the place was near empty this morning .
i only saw one full cart the whole time .
service is extremely slow .
rule one of restaurant etiquette , control your kids !
there are big problems here .
peter was always around running things .
the restaurant was horribly under staffed .
would n't take the chance .
this was our favorite restaurant especially for dim sum .
the service was simply horrible .
the food left much to be desired .
dim sum overall were slightly dry around the edges .
i lost my appetite and never went back .
even another patient mentioned that it was rude !
i do not recommend center az heart specialist .
i do not recommend center az heart specialist .
i try to never go to this store .
i hate the way things are organized .
long story , long recipe .
sprouts market has cheaper prices on produce .
however , you will pay the price for it .
the code is _num_ .
you ca n't tell without you slice it .
lee lee 's stinks .
again , crappy customer service .
i have not opened them yet .
plus , prices seem more expensive .
the most disappointing part is their customer service .
i avoid this store unless i need something specific .
they have no brazilian in this store !
not so much anymore .
that ca n't be good for business .
you guys need an inventory control system .
my money was stolen out of my purse .
she did n't even thank me .
i was unable to make it out the door .
do n't think i 'll be back .
so another _num_ minutes there .
this place is terrible !
just brakes ... just stinks !
wish i could rate no stars !
that was the only positive experience i had .
i think crash , burn and die . ''
ended up getting inconsistent stories from two mechanics .
went from $ _num_ to over a $ _num_ .
`` fool me once ... '' so no .
i did n't get it all done that day .
lol i think not .
never go to just brakes .
hard and flavorless , it was utterly unacceptable .
tasted like there was no vinegar or seasoning whatsoever .
the place was packed , which was unbelievable .
the sushi was bland with a lot of rice .
it was just about all you could taste .
before ninja was not bad .
at least the sake is cheap and good .
worst sushi i 've ever had .
not a good sign .
the food was n't that great .
ugh the sushi is terrible here !
there is no flavor and its dry !
worst sushi i have ever had .
we look at it but nothing sounds appetizing .
he did n't enjoy them anyway .
unfortunately that all ended a couple of months ago .
simply ca n't be done .
so anyone can have a bad night .
the worse restaurant i have been to !
the food was gross .
they literally gave me a side of hot sauce .
i was like , uh no .
i was not impressed with the food at all .
so not a great selection .
was n't especially fresh and definitely flavorless .
they were like all rice no fish .
now many of the rolls have cream cheese ?
it took _num_ mins to get just _num_ roll !
two of the rolls were just `` eh '' .
it was not good .
my water tasted so bad !
table service was lacking .
never again ... ... .
price for it was n't that great .
sushi was good , service was bad .
it was just bad all around .
i went with my boyfriend on a thursday night .
the sushi was terrible and over priced .
terrible experience and a lot of money
food was okay , service was horrible .
unfortunately , we will not be going back .
do n't waste your time !
please get your restaurant better organized .
you lost our sushi card .
wo n't be back .
the list goes on with this place .
later she was at a table drinking wine .
whether or not everything was fresh is questionable .
at that point , i cancelled my order .
our meal should have been comped .
this is unbearable and wasted of time .
the service was marginal at best .
the place looks run down .
does this business owner even read the reviews here ?
i did not see anything here .
all in all , steer clear from this place .
they forgot orders and they never refilled our cups .
_num_ minutes later , got my drink .
_num_ minutes later , placed my order .
_num_ minutes later , got soup .
_num_ minutes later , got the salad .
food is n't bad but is n't amazing .
the sashimi was surprisingly soft and yummy .
seriously poor customer service .
and the service at the store is not good .
would n't use them again .
my money will never go to ultimate electronics .
we will not be going back .
the customer service has always been pretty bad .
now i know why the employees dont smile .
this place is gross .
if not , i will expand .
but seriously , the atmosphere is horribly family oriented .
after all , we ordered _num_ entrees ! )
my problem was the food .
all four items we ordered were bad .
my french dip was pretty mediocre .
it came out cold and dried out .
she had n't even started yet .
your my waiter , own the situation .
corn chowder was tasty but not very hot .
totally raw and cold .
he ate half his sandwich before his fiance noticed .
we all lost our lunch !
the selection was horrible .
the service was even worse .
the restaurant was not very busy .
the soup was cold when i finally got it .
the food made me and my friend sick .
has been going downhill for years .
used to be my favorite place .
tries to be upscale , but fails .
this was a very sad experience .
the place was empty .
all i learned is why the place was empty .
wish i could write a review .
so i called for takeout breakfast .
this mimi 's cafe is terrible !
turns out our name was never on the list .
what point is a reservation then really ?
it was totally out of place .
waitress was rather on the slow side .
the service and management is most surely lacking .
there was already a party waiting .
my entire breakfast was cold .
my wife 's was hot .
no need to return .
this place is not worth it .
i was beyond disappointed .
the turkey bacon brie mushroom crepes were awful today !
yet another fancy rip-off .
almost _num_ minutes before we got our food .
when we got our food it was pathetic .
did not really taste any .
these are $ _num_ and $ _num_ dishes !
we said thanks but no thanks .
we will not come here again .
anyway i chose the salmon .
bland food , terrible service and overpriced .
the wait staff is also very inattentive .
perhaps the worst experience in a restaurant ever .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
restaurant was not busy at all .
drinks were not refilled .
no wonder they are going out of business .
anyhow , i 'm not picky .
the $ _num_ red house wine was good though .
my gf thought the cobb salad was ok .
no option for baked potato .
wanted chicken and they are all out of chicken .
terrible service and food .
the wait staff was mostly standing around .
service left a lot to be desired .
not so much now .
we will not be back .
husband was equally unimpressed .
the turkey was not real turkey .
nothing on it , not even herbs .
i could not eat any of this .
i also took the turkey home to my dogs .
a most disgusting meal .
i do n't know how they stay in business .
will not go back .
husband called it sad - standard american diet .
it was obviously not prepared by any chef .
my guess is they never bother to clean it .
what else do they never clean ?
i am so disappointed in this place .
i would give zero stars if i could .
looks nice but is n't at all .
not a nice place at all !
the worst service ever in my entire dining experience .
it was ok , nothing exceptional .
he did n't even acknowledge us .
what a nightmare experience .
never had service this awful !
do n't bother with this place .
when we got home the order was totally wrong .
never going back , such a complete disappointment .
sake sashimi for $ _num_ ) .
guess we wo n't know unless we try again .
we were excited to visit this sushi restaurant .
but our anniversary was totally ruined .
their service was terrible , just terrible .
after that things just went wrong in every way .
they brought at least _num_ dishes to wrong tables .
yes , we just felt ignored and miserable .
did n't even say hello .
he was rude and not friendly .
took my money and business down the street .
they really need to work on hiring better employees .
i will not go back again !
we just stood there thinking we will wait .
i was very offended and walked out .
it almost ruined our anniversary dinner .
we started off with the fried calamari .
it looked great but tasted awful .
and the restaurant was not overly packed .
unfortunately shimogamo left a bad taste in my mouth .
very disappointed there was no sushi .
we got ignored most of the night .
the food quality is very cheap .
this is the worst sushi i have ever had .
the fish was bad and smelled .
not please back later but `` no ! ''
if i could give no stars i would .
he ignored me the first time i walked in .
i have never been so mad after a meal .
i was completely unsatisfied and disappointed .
just 3x as much money .
this places blows and i am pissed .
$ _num_ for _num_ rolls , sashimi and edamame .
i am still hungry and never going back .
i just do n't get it .
i hate you shimogamo .
i really hate you .
great sushi but horrible customer service .
i will never be going back .
customer service , more seating and more affordable sushi .
do n't go through the drive through .
they f you in the drive through .
that 's fucking disgusting .
maybe i was just tired and grumpy ... .
not the worst out there .
first time they served me oatmeal in a cup .
she did n't care about taking my order .
never been denied business for nicely asking a question !
this is not rocket science .
i am _num_ years old .
the snack selection at the market is very limited .
no longer accepts debit cards at the pumps .
could n't find soda i wanted inside .
i have _num_ high end watches that needed batteries .
it was only batteries after all .
i thought no big deal and proceeded to browse .
i was pretty disgusted .
the customer service is lacking at best .
they refused to even discount replacing it .
booking an appointment is a nightmare .
they do n't care about their patients at all .
it 's hit or miss .
i would not recommend them to anyone i like .
they did n't even apologize for my huge inconvenience .
counted at least ten ants in one stall alone !
i will not be coming back .
but mainly the meat was way too dry .
they get our order wrong more often than not .
eating in is n't much better .
they also frequently serve old food .
new management or ownership is really needed here .
1st window repeated it .
dirty ... bad customer service .
no a/c in the building , still serving customers .
unfortunately , this location does n't get it .
southern food does n't hurt me .
i was ok , i 'll take one .
we spent way too much i .
however , there are some issues that i have .
my youngest , however , needs my assistance .
however , it has been like that each time .
our _num_ year old cost $ _num_ .
what the hell do you want ?
do n't go into the bathrooms .
this place is filthy and needs more seating .
ca n't help you .
i 'm equal parts shocked and annoyed at fedex .
do not go to this location .
i was assured it would take about _num_ minutes .
that put a bad taste in my mouth .
( fedex 's problem , not my drive . )
lastly the lighting in the room was so harsh !
disappointing , and terrible !
i tried calling front desk and it was busy .
the tv was stuck on one channel .
i should get a refund for this !
the wifi is horrible .
there is no jacuzzi .
we stayed one night in room _num_ .
was not told about this when making reservation .
not enthusiastic when answering the phone at night .
the lamp shade had a hole in it .
the room was not clean .
and we could n't even use the pool .

i will not be back .
too bad , really like the quaint garden area .
would n't take my dog there .
carrots all tasted old .
hubby 's dish was beef yakisoba ... even worse .
highly disappointed in eggroll .
no one ate much .
yes it was that bad .
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
else it will be _num_ star .
i could n't finish the chicken .
the food is below mediocre now !
the new owners changed way too much .
do n't bother going anymore .
i think _num_ star is being a bit generous .
worst white meat teriyaki chicken i have ever tasted .
will just stick with aloha kitchen much better food .
the resturant looked clean and was busy .
i wish i ordered that instead .
the chicken was burnt and dry .
this was the worst i have ever eaten .
could n't finish it .
we will not be ordering from here again .
this ultra sugary fake maple syrup flavor is dreadful .
do n't really recommend .
the chicken often has little vibes in it .
the worst food poisoning ever .
in total i counted _num_ small pieces of beef .
what am i really paying for here ?
_num_ $ for just a bowl of noodles ?
not the best korean food i had .
do not order japanese food here .
oh thank you god !
it was the worst set ever .
do not go to this place .
they are minus zero stars .
they did a total bait and switch on me .
maybe they are , i do n't know yet .
but i do n't care .
they did n't even apologize .
it was very unprofessional .
this is exactly what i was trying to avoid .
i would not come here again .
she said they are already discounted .
she told me the drinks are normally $ _num_ .
two hundred percent increase in less than _num_ months !
staff is not the friendliest .
coupon or not , it 's not worth it .
not _num_ hours on friday .
if you 're closed , shut your lights off .
i should n't have to explain this to you .
it 's not rocket science .
please just go out of business .
avoid at all costs .
why did i never call my regular vet ?
worst experience with eye doctors .
the front desk is terrible .
they try to rip you off however they can .
it used to not be this way .
horrible experience , and their prices were overpriced .
the prices are higher then most gun stores .
frustrated i left and ordered online .
for _num_ gun competition some months ago .
a call to discuss would have worked .
the front sight is rotated a little off center .
no wonder it fell off .
just like i requested originally .
they are also grossly overpriced on most things .
prices - way overpriced , on everything .
she just turned and walked away .
this gun shop deserves a rating of lol .
... not answering the phone .
i could n't agree with david more .
the food was bland and boring at best .
i would not go back .
i really liked it the first couple times .
i was kind of embarrassed by the service .
did n't care for it .
expensive , small portions , and mediocre cooking .
i was so mad .
sorry , wo n't be back .
suffice to say i was disappointed .
the food is bland .
one star is too much for this restaurant .
what a rip off .
$ _num_ for a small bowl of noodles .
first , the owner was irritating and sarcastic .
i do n't recommend this place .
this did not help the location and decor .
if i could give zero stars i would .
pho for $ _num_ ?
there is no one in the place .
first off , the food is horribly overpriced .
taste wise , the pho was horrible .
additionally , the brisket smelled like it was spoiled .
even my american co-worker thought the food tasted horribly .
it was that bad .
that should have been the warning sign for me .
stick to pho chandler .
cheap plastic furniture starts it off .
pineapple curry chicken was terrible .
lastly the short ribs matched the other two dishes .
the food is just ok .
sorry but that wo n't do .
this was not the case .
i thought wild horse pass casino was already open .
made them rush me through .
since i was rushed the treatment was ok .
took forever to get seated even with reservations .
then forever to get food .
we got tired of waiting for everything .
never a problem there .
your masseuse is of course thrown off .
the towels are n't hot .
the hot oil is n't even warm .
massage ends , i head out to pay .
but _num_ % discount ?
_num_ of the _num_ minute massage was terrible .
sounds like a great deal , right ?
no one seemed to know our names .
also , the specialty drinks were legendary .
the bad ... price .
in fact , they were very pretentious .
i would avoid this at all cost .
not impressed i will try again .
we almost walked out and went elsewhere .
glass of house pinot noir now $ _num_ .
desert schools is neither !
do n't have direct deposit ?
do n't go to this branch !
wish i had never opened an account here .
do n't waste your money .
does my bank believe me.
i will not be returning to this branch again .
they smell gross and the toilets are never clean .
they were roughly 1/3 off retail price .
what a waste of a gift .
however , it really is n't .
they could not get any of the stains out .
they refunded me with cash .
i submitted his bid to my insurance company .
yet brian did not even show up .
if i could give zero stars i would .
sucks to wait and get blown off .
no call ... nothing .
can not recommend them .
they had done nothing .
i have not paid nor received any warranty .
do not hire this company !
no , fucking do it today .
these guys are a joke .
my bad for not walking away .
their sales department has no ethics .
it was for a _num_ and did n't fit .
bad customer service and the part was wrong .
i went there twice and nothing was done .
finger prints and dirt all over it .
i gave one star because the dealership is clean .
not a dealership that i would trust .
the pharmacy staff is extremely slow and incompetent .
prices are typical nothing special .
i am so disgusted with this place !
i came up to the register and was ignored .
he did n't really even acknowledge me ( e.g .
there was very little cheese .
it 's not a difficult thing to prepare .
at $ _num_ each it should have been better .
maybe it was n't a good day .
my whole experience with her was unpleasant .
the sandwich itself left much to be desired of .
thanks but no thanks .
i thought that was extremely unprofessional and rude !
i went in to get a pedicure for myself .
seriously ... $ _num_ for a bucket of water ?
so it pains me to write this review !
it was kind of rude .
i will not be returning .
i wo n't be back .
anyway , this time my oldest picked indian .
my daughter got chicken tikka masala , her favorite .
these , too , were fine .
no fine dining but not bad .
to be fair it was dead .
it was right under the empty toilet paper dispenser .
maybe we hit them on a bad night .
i wo n't be returning to this restaurant again .
i will not return even with groupon .
they cost us _num_ per naan .
naan is _num_ each ! ''
there were _num_ techs and _num_ customer .
terrible , terrible , terrible service .
there were _num_ people in the store .
$ _num_ for gel nails .
great selection , lacking service .
they too were `` meh . ''
amazon is where i will buy toys now .
you just lost a lot of business .
just to come out empty handed .
so why _num_ stars ?
i am paying $ _num_ per night .
the whole room is out dated .
not worth the money .
so it does n't makes sense to me .
very very dirty carpet .
ac would n't work .
front desk people are unprofessional idiots .
if you stay here you get what you deserve .
my initial reaction was _num_ star .
but we stayed _num_ days and it was okay .
probably _num_ to _num_ stars .
the furniture could use updating .
the front desk was helpful .
having only bathroom for six people was not !
oh my back is killing me .
does n't change time .
the check in process was slow .
the room was blah .
sure could use some updates .
cleanliness is not their first priority .
but it has gone downhill badly .
my most recent stay in september was horrible .
the lock on my room door did n't work .
the carpets in the hall were dirty and smelly .
the food served for breakfast was inedible .
i wo n't be staying here again .
for _num_ people and no discount no sorry nothing .
this place is gross .
and everything looks dingy and old .
internet does not work .
very outdated and paper thin walls .
hurry up and get her a room .
she 's been complaining of not feeling well . ''
unfortunately , no one ever returned my call .
needless to say - no sleep for me .
horrible excuse for a hotel room .
the sink was dirty .
halls were dirty , breakfast sucked .
i do n't even want to give one star .
the food is mediocre at best .
all i had was a potato .
this is not one of the better valley locations .
i did n't get to place the order .
bull crap i have records !
other people were having the same problem .
got my potato soup and it was cold .
the cheese on top would n't even melt .
my tuna sandwiches was tasteless .
there was no flavor to it .
but they made the sandwich wrong .
no how are you today ?
i could n't eat was so gross .
this place was n't very good .
it was old , dry bread with old tomatoes .
i could n't even finish it .
would not recommend at all .
worst service ever and worst management !
lost _num_ regulars for life !
( looked to be roaches ) and was filthy .
my girlfriend and i were horrified .
i could n't even finish my food .
i wish i could give them no stars .
i received my ring back , paid the fees .
super irritated , i waited the week .
i am absolutely disgusted with this store .
no selection and feels pretty cramped .
stick with foot locker .
i do n't get cold stone .
horrible business practice will never return there again .
nothing else in it , not what we ordered .
the most filthy experience and rude service .
the customer service at this place was terrible .
two were not helping with customers at all .
ice cream was not cold enough .
i will never step foot in this store again .
dont bother with this place .
but was told there are no refunds .
i am extremely disappointed in this chandler mall location .
i was very disappointed !
the customer service at this store was horrible .
we couldnt even get them from other stores !
i went back and i asked to return them .
they always ask , `` are you sure ? ''
the apple store sells computers .
and more importantly , the apple store repairs computers .
and then the wait .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
because service here was awful .
before here , i had went to verizon .
this experience left me with a lot of questions .
would n't come here unless i was absolutely desperate .
i 'm calling bs on this .
something is smelling like rotten apples !
then the two of them walked off .
can the service get any worse ?
one person to help every customer is the worst .
i purchased the iphone _num_ on day one .
i left without any face time or questions answered .
i am extremely disappointed at the customer service .
are you kidding me ?
ya i signed off that that may happen .
i will no longer be recommending apple products .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
the staff ( including management ) is really arrogant .
not worth even a single star .
stay away from this apple store .
talk about the worst .
now this store , straight crap .
she treats everything like gold .
they replaced the phone and solved the issue .
you have lost my business .
and they have not solved my issue at all .
i 'm so disappointed .
total waste of time because of incompetent scheduling lady .
that is not the way to handle customer service .
( assuming phone is somewhat working ) .
the customer should never know more than the salesman .
there were more staff in the store then customers !
this is not helpful at all to the customer .
horrible customer service for your customers .
omg , what a nightmare !
tech support was rude .
completely obvious mistakes , visible to the naked eye .
is a customer worth that little ?
however , the maintenance for their pieces is terrible .
disrespectful and did i say rude ?
i would never recommend them .
take your money and go elsewhere .
the man doing my nails tried and failed .
she had to go elsewhere to get fixed .
i wo n't be back .
hard to communicate most of time .
first time at party nails and the experience sucked .
so avoid her please .
if you hate your job , quit .
they are money hungry assholes .
i walked out one day .
wo n't go here anymore .
i hate salesmen that lie .
got caught in a _num_ day return policy .
sadly i broke my promise and came back .
i ordered corned beef hash and eggs .
the eggs were cold .
the corn beef has was not cooked and cold .
i will not be back .
the truth is it was nothing special .
the food is just that , nothing special .
lastly , the food just is n't that good .
you fell off the wall .
therefore , there is a honey shortage .
blatantly serving me fake honey is not ok.
i am not convinced .
very disappointed with this visit .
the mixed greens are just gross .
nothing to write home about .
when the food came it was barely warm .
the only good thing was the remodel .
disappointed in the changes they 've made .
never never purchase an extended warranty from lowes .
it 's quite a scam they have going on .
apparently lowes urgent care is _num_ days !
_num_ days and not a specific time .
not a worker in sight .
girl at checkout asked if i found everything ok .
she only responded with a blank stare .
obviously there was no interest in selling the refrigerator .
absolutely the worst customer service !
such a load of crap .
tried the nachos last time , they were good .
we will not be going back .
the service here is usually _num_ stars .
no toppings at all .
this is no way to run a business !
i paid extra for grilled veggies and extra chicken .
what i got was an underwhelming bowl .
not worth driving out of my way for .
this place is the absolute worst to deal with .
they do not stand behind their products .
after only a few months they went bad .
ah , good ol ' _num_ and diner .
the feta cheese was dry .
drove from se gilbert for chili omelette so disappointed !
at least the other locations are apparently staying open .
review is for the service department .
unprofessional at best , dishonest at worst .
if i could go lower i would .
they replaced the transmission on my company vehicle .
we brought our _num_ in over a week ago .
however lost my paperwork for _num_ months .
no big deal , all under warranty .
( without ever even raising my voice ) .
worst car buying experience i have ever had .
service department lacks customer service .
now my wife ca n't get to work .
we were @ $ _num_ from our max budget .
we left feeling very scammed and disappointed .
having first oil change in this little car .
employees using the same restroom customers do .
no other information was given .
that seems a bit strange to me .
there was _num_ other customer in the entire place .
my husband and i could not believe these folks .
bad treatment for customers .
took hours and hours and the salesman was obnoxious .
my car was not clean .
really makes me not like freeway chevrolet .
plus i already have financing through my bank .
everybody else was very rude .
the seating in the waiting room was minimal .
change oil and rotate tires .
i promise they wont disappoint on that end .
i understand why you must charge more .
this is the second time this has been done .
they are just ridiculous .
i just do n't get it .
its too bad because some dealers do .
i reply with `` hell no .
i waited another week and sent another text .
i was told no more car washes .
was n't part of their original offer .
go elsewhere to buy your chevy or used vehicle .
possibly the worst buying experience ever !
would you guys quit already !
stay far away from this crooked bunch .
do n't waste your time dealing at this place .
seems like a scam to me !
that 's a bit lengthy though .
sorry , bad suggestion .
mine went up to $ _num_ from $ _num_ !
at least a _num_ hour wait .
the appointments do n't mean anything .
this _num_ star review is for the sales team .
not a good idea .
needless to say the warranty ended .
this dealership is one of the worst !
well my old loan is still not paid .
sitting there and hearing this crap made me sick .
i wo n't be coming back .
they said there was no going back !
i ended up waiting for almost three hours instead .
but again lack of communication .
and then you keep calling me .
a total waste of time .
total waste of time and money .
waste of money and time .
cvs minute clinic dropped the ball , big time !
the reason for my _num_ star review ?
i saw no reason to be concerned .
then we walks away .
guess what ; no sales associate .
this home depot will not get my business again .
cranky , clearly did n't care about us .
my fianc and i ordered a product online .
she did not smile once the whole time .
apparently neither men could check out an online purchase .
they were very rude .
place needs new employees .
everyone is rude and unfriendly .
dont know why i keep coming here .
there was no one around to ask for help .
which is not the case .
sometimes you really should listen to your patients .
i will not be returning .
when she answered the phone she already sounded annoyed .
we can not recommend this doctor .
i mean ... what the hell !
instead i sat there wondering where she went .
workers are super slow .
this is the worst customer service .
wish we never left verizon .
this is the worst store .
if i could give negative stars i would .
the worst customer service on this planet .
i ca n't believe how ridiculous that is .
apparently neither they nor can fix their posted hours .
second , i hate to complain .
our lights did n't work in our room .
the housekeeping staff needs additional training .
two people stayed in the room for _num_ nights .
the breakfast food selection was poor .
the television signal was terrible .
the room layout is awkward .
i will never return nor will i recommend .
taco bell cooks better .
there were a few patrons sitting down .
i went back for lunch .
it was not explained very clearly on the menu .
in the end , i just felt ripped off .
the food here is ok but nothing special .
the service and ambiance are very lacking .
very slow service this time .
she ca n't eat beef .
well it was beef and now she is sick .
unfortunately i got screwed !
did not feel me up .
that was not cool .
came in to send out some flat rate boxes .
the worst nail place ever .
does not earn even one star .
would not let my son use the customer bathroom .
she was completely rude .
she was pre paid so could care less .
i am not allowed to return to her store .
employees need more training .
worst customer service - ever !
prices are very affordable and the food is ok .
the food itself was pretty mediocre .
i will not be back again .
no bueno , nothing to write home about .
they sat _num_ other groups .
we went back inside and there was no room .
sadly , i was unimpressed .
overall i would not eat here again .
we wo n't be going back .
for us , the food was not memorable .
i wo n't be going back .
very generic subpar food at high prices .
i then proceeded to wait until friday !
they eventually printed out another one with much trouble .
don '' t do business with these guys !
overall it was an ok experience .
no fridge , the ac did n't work properly .
will not be staying at this hotel again .
working with fine point finished was awful .
they were terrible with communication .
many times i never received a phone call .
we lost several hundreds of dollars to this company .
do not use this company .
worst experience of my life .
i have been to the dentist before .
you still have another _num_ minutes .
oh , and it 's not over .
seriously the worst , absolute experience of my life .
the cake decorating section is piss poor .
ignoring us does n't make us go away .
this store needs a serious corporate overhaul .
the customer service level also needs some upgrading .
very bad customer service .
if i could rate them any lower i would .
disgusting , filthy , cramped store .
it 's also messy and cramped !
_num_ ) i would expect a toilet to flush .
keep your candy bars , chandler residence inn .
no respect for platinum members !
... ... motel _num_ !
that 's poor customer service .
it indeed was sears to my surprise !
i know , we 're weird .
but we got sick of getting sick .
other than that , the ambiance was irritating .
i wo n't be back .
so this review is nothing against the company itself .
poorly seasoned , and yes , frequently undercooked .
another two times the rice was under cooked .
portion size is way down .
first off the place was a hot mess today .
oh , and the rice was under cooked also .
however this location was incredibly rude to me .
going to the chandler mall one from now on .
this place has really gone downhill .
my rice is hard my lettuce looks old .
to never forget how big our burrito is .
$ _num_ for chips and guac is n't cheap !
unfortunately this one is pretty lame .
i had the wood fire grilled salmon .
quite irritating and inconsiderate actually .
the clam chowder tasted canned .
actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill .
but ... damn their seafood needs some change .
i could n't even finish the meal .
first bad experience though .
it may have just been a bad night .
unless you are just craving red lobster skip it .
: / not cool .
and the tartar sauce , has no taste .
another waiter brought us out our food .
this was expensive night out .
sadly we will never go here again .
this night at red lobster was the worst .
it actually smelled like chemicals and building materials .
next was a caesar salad , which was good .
i was really unimpressed and thought it was bland .
for dessert , i had the brownie .
lobster was not fully cooked .
it was less than mediocre !
my scallops smelled funny and tasted bad .
our only positive thing was our server .
walked around the restaurant .
nasty , salty and buttery food .
the place was n't even busy that night .
and the mussels were dry not seasoned and cold !
no will i recommend to people i know ?
f # # k no !
nothing on the menu looked fresh .
yes , it tasted like frozen salt water seafood .
will not return again .
just real bad service .
there is no happy hour .
the lobster on both was over done and rubbery .
the server larry is very rude .
very bland tasting everything from start to finish .
this is where it begins .
sadly , i will never eat here again .
pad thai : average ( at best ) flavor .
tom yum soup tasted only like chicken broth .
update : wait is way too long .
the only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom !
overall nothing really stood out .
the waitress came and grabbed the dish away .
it was just ok .
she talked as if she was annoyed .
such an unacceptable behavior .
totally ruined my day .
never going back to be treated so terribly .
even upon arriving , i was utterly disappointed .
my duck was burnt as well ) .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
how does this place have _num_ star reviews ?
worst thai restaurant i ever visited .
their curry dishes are awful .
i was not happy with taste .
this pizza hut location has poor customer service !
i wo n't be ordering from here again .
threw my appetite off !
just like macaroni grill .
not a fan of oily over-cooked pasta .
i most likely wont be going back .
i like pepper but not overpowering .
we skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home .
we ate at carrabba 's in chandler last night .
the service left a lot to be desired .
the caesar salad was horrible .
cheese melted but outside tasted like old grease .
the salad was lettuce , carrots and dressing .
i 'm not _num_ .
i am not even exaggerating the hour wait .
just from eating the salad and a couple bites .
the service was awful .
the ambiance was very wrong for a carrabba 's .
guess i turned invisible for _num_ minutes there .
the staff could not be anymore friendly !
but the food was not good at all .
my husband just ate what he got .
even the soup , i mean really ?
waited forever for check , you get the point .
and i tried again tonight .
a little too late .
i 'm not returning .
it was n't impressive for what you pay for .
they really skimp on the salad dressing .
once he addressed it , it was still no .
stingy greedy corporate management .
it was greasy and tasteless !
wtf do n't recommend coming here !
ca n't get the time right ?
it 's a ripoff !
not so sure about this place anymore .
another fail for this store .
i do n't get it .
today 's meal failed even that low standard .
the california omelet was not much better .
the veggies and cheese were barely cooked .
still have $ _num_ left on the gift card .
you should n't have '' no , seriously .
she really should n't have .
i do not understand it !
ok sorry for the rant .
_num_ minutes later , my friends got their food .
all in all a pretty bad experience .
it 's like they just do n't care .
overpriced , underwhelming food .
i ca n't believe i spent $ _num_ here .
it makes me die a little to write that .
i do n't understand this place .
my wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap .
the bread was cold and hard .
kids like it and its not a bad vibe .
i 'll be back , but not for breakfast .
btw , the food is under cook !
drinks were slow getting out , another _num_ minutes .
food was also slow getting out .
the wait was supposed to be _num_ minutes .
will not be returning .
customer service was not that great .
why not just have us wait ?
the catfish actually looked like fried chicken .
will not be back .
the waitress had no idea i was there again .
our food was so bland .
just a huge bowl of noodles no flavor .
almost no sauce so we sent it back .
guess i 'm not the only one .
no server to be found .
very disappointing for such an expensive upper scale restaurant .
that was n't any fun .
i 'm really disappointed with them .
never come back to this place .
got orders all wrong .
regardless the wait time service was just horrible .
i probably wo n't come to this location again .
because there is virtually no flavor .
the burger was undercooked .
probably the worst pasta i have ever tried anywhere .
later on it got better .
this review is n't about that .
this is based on my incredibly disappointing dining experience .
twenty something minutes later , my plantains came .
everyone else had already eaten .
my food was then cold .
it was kind of pathetic .
the shrimp was so dry and overcooked .
the noodles were a little bland .
this dish was nothing spectacular .
kind of a disappointment .
major food poisoning at this place .
first bad experience at a cheesecake factory .
wo n't be going back to this location .
do n't eat here if you 're vegan .
the waiter asked me if i wanted cheesecake .
no one there ; no one around .
must be having a bad day or something .
the bathroom was not clean and not well kept .
the starbucks cafe was a joke .
the gals behind the counter were slow and rude ?
i went to customer service to get my refund .
not my favorite place .
fail hugo from best buy of chandler !
what a customer service nightmare !
i would not come here again for anything .
_num_ hours wasted for absolutely nothing .
wow this place is surprisingly bad .
the worst customer service .
i wish i could give no stars ... ... .
the management at every level is horrid .
too expensive on most products .
at walmart , $ _num_ .
it was not busy at all .
they might not last anywhere else .
horrible service and product knowledge , even worse .
never shopping here again .
they would not help me .
auto pay should just be done in the store .
worst customer service experience ever !
when i told him that was a _num_ min .
i grabbed my tower and went to my truck .
do n't waste your time .
bad attitude , bad review .
staff and manager did not care and were rude .
i actually find the meat market vibe annoying .
it used to be incredible .
the server was very polite .
and the place was not even full of people .
bad service do not recommend going there .
it comes down to service or lack of .
she is only _num_ .
we very nearly left , thoroughly disgusted .
we probably wo n't go back .
very cool environment but the worst and slowest service .
very disappointed in the way she handled it .
very disappointing food quality .
made the mistake of bringing my _num_ year old .
is n't that a side dish ?
chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon .
the rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple .
the salmon , just more frozen fair .
the ciabatta roll was dry and tasteless .
its a shame they ca n't handle both .
are you kidding me ?
my crab crunch roll , however , was wrong .
these tasted like stale styrofoam .
not a nice dude .
what a huge disappointment .
unfortunately the service was horrible .
however , not anytime soon .
i am not sure if i will go back .
none were to be found !
our waitress refilled our drinks and then disappeared !
once again its not consistent .
however , the main dishes are mediocre at best .
not on any planet .
the oriental salad i ordered lacked presentation .
i doubt we will be back .
should have stuck to the food court .
menu is limited and expensive .
service is ridiculously slow .
taste of food is just meh .
bathroom is dirty with trash on floor .
lighting is awful and makes you sleepy .
expensive mistake to make while hungry .
next time , well , anything else .
she said `` ok '' and walked away .
very small sushi portions !
the place was a mess .
the chicken was lackluster and barely crusted or cooked .
the service was nonexistent .
the entrees also took so long to prepare .
i would not come back .
it 's not worth it - esp .
for how much money kona charges too .
i said not good .
worst sushi and service ever !
might try again another time probably not .
i 'm sorry bummed about this place .
thick , thick , tough chicken .
my friend 's order came out wrong .
then the manager insisted it was correct .
sushi is decent , but service is very slow .
a miss for me .
i 'm bummed about this though .
the selection is really , really slim .
their serviced was n't acceptable !
i was like no i dont !
this is a bad !
never will i or my family go back .
now i can not even get the phone answered .
the worst hotel experience ever .
never will stay in hyatt again .
they left us high and dry .
the last few times were terrible .
i 've never seen a burger so gross .
service is always horrible .
the burger was nothing like the photo .
i will not be rushing back to this place .
do n't waste your time with this location .
and why a single diner gets ignored ... .
so i did n't even bother to order more .
still waiting for coffee after asking _num_ times .
not a good value for the money .
the service is poor also .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
we walked out and i will never come back .
it was $ _num_ for _num_ burgers and drinks .
i left hungry and pissed off .
i left hungry and pissed off .
what on earth happened here ?
new decor and no service .
_num_ minutes and no drink order taken .
not even a lot .
she was giving me an attitude and everything .
ruined my experience and i will not be back .
that is so unbelievably disgusting !
terrible service towards the end .
probably wo n't be back .
i 've never had such terrible service .
our food was cold and the broccoli was rubbery .
it was so bad .
i would not recommend this place .
burger was horribly overcooked !
i do n't know why people like red robin .
first off , the service was bad .
the food is n't all that great .
so i guess none of it was good .
my food came out cold and dry .
a straw will not work .
not my best experience .
whiskey river wrap dry and not very full .
crazy ... stick to the sunday 's here ... .
smoothies are n't supposed to be watery !
i do n't do screaming .
i ordered a soup in a sourdough bread bowl .
service was very slow for just soup and sandwich .
probably about _num_ minutes to get the food .
frankly , it was ridiculous .
the soup itself was tomato garlic .
we did n't have a great experience here .
then again , most likely not .
even the customers were rude !
with a totally inappropriate tone .
she was so rude .
i 'm so sorry ! ''
the register with unhappy stunned faces .
i 'm so embarrassed !
this was terribly overcooked .
it is a shame and an amateur mistake .
generic , flavorless food .
disappointed and wo n't be returning .
my wife refuses to be near me .
there is nothing `` fantastic '' about this place .
no smiles or friendly attitude at all .
worst of all was the haircut itself .
one of the worst haircuts i ever had .
i will not go back there .
any how i came in on a saturday afternoon .
the end of the session was the worst .
bottom line , i will never be back .
got a haircut in less than _num_ minutes .
worst mexican in the valley .
it 's like the rainforest cafe of mexican food .
what an disaster of a restaurant .
the sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick .
food was meh ... really expensive too .
not impressed ... never went back .
i will not be back .
the chips were also nothing special .
mediocre food and so so service .
chips greasy and thin .
salsa thin and watery .
i was starving ( what else is new ? )
when dessert was offered , we politely declined .
i was very embarrassed .
first off , the atmosphere was nice .
the refried beans were very bland .
no lard for sure !
my guess , flank or skirt steak !
the veggies under it were not mexican !
they were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke !
just gross and very over priced !
shrimp cocktail was terrible .
hit a street taco vendor instead .
husband complained of not many fixings .
nothing special about it at all .
the cheese was weird .
the rice was tasteless like they didnt use spices .
same went for the beans just bland and yuck .
beer was ok i guess - got a pitcher .
i 'd never go back .
they were okay , nothing special .
it was very bad .
still deciding , huh ? ''
and then walked away .
the charge was taken off the bill .
the food was not impressive nor was the service .
tasted a little watered down .
they brought chips and _num_ salsas .
my bill was $ _num_ .
jalapeo fritters were the best thing i ate .
yes , they have _num_ types of salsa ... .
the green one is just plain offensive .
let 's see ... flavorless and waaaay overlooked .
the salsa left much to be desired .
honestly , the whole meal was just ick .
i would avoid this restaurant .
unfortunately , i was quite disappointed .
their green salsa is out of this world .
there was a digital screen on our table !
no seasonings to speak of .
bland , bland , bland !
i had some shrimp , quesadillas and poppers .
shrimp was good but rice was stale .
i was not happy with what i ate .
i ordered the _num_ variety fajitas .
the rice was cold and the beans were dry .
quite frankly i 've had better mexican food elsewhere .
hardly any room for salsa .
i was totally wrong !
horrible rude disgusting food !
and was very bland and flavorless .
it was instant potatoes !
nothing was worth going back for .
this is not authentic mexican food .
and i do love mac .
over the weekend , on sat .
she was horrible , very bad customer service .
so thumbs down to mac this weekend .
the mac counter is the worse !
horrible stuck up over made up stuck up associates .
i had the worse experience at mac yesterday .
employees are rude and completely unhelpful .
i had the worse experience at mac yesterday .
i wish i could give this store _num_ stars .
the worst people work here .
very short and rude .
ummmm , let me check . ''
every time my experience here get 's worse .
really there should be no stars .
no customer service at all .
i was very disappointed with the service .
so they replaced it after a few weeks .
please do n't spend your money here .
it was never opened .
why do n't they just take the sign down .
goodbye , i 'm going to macy 's .
the worst customer service ever !
no card , no number .
i was purchased mattress around june _num_ _num_ .
do n't buy anything from sears .
at that price it should have been done professionally .
at the end , i am returning everything .
please avoid at all costs !
it indeed was sears to my surprise !
i walk in the mall frequently .
what poor customer service consistently .
i got there _num_ minutes prior to closing .
they must not associate their name with pizza .
$ _num_ a pizza is not average though .
not that good , and too expensive .
she asked for tomatoes , but no sauce .
so there is obvious a service issue here .
otherwise there is no reason to eat here .
crappy service , just ok food .
the crust was so thin and tough to chew .
it took another _num_ minutes before anyone came over .
service was a little slow .
but that was n't what bothered me .
hands down worst experience ever !
our waiter was just lost .
patrick he was awesome !
she then walked away also .
i was n't too happy about .

it was a rare family night ruined .
let 's begin with arrival .
so , then , you 've been seated .

and my waiter was n't the most attentive .
awesome shoes but the employees suck .
they just chill at the register .
the customer service sucked .

the appetizers were just ok .
nothing to get thrilled over .
what a horrible idea .
it sure did n't look like the picture .
slow service and cold nachos .
sausage ... not so much .
overall not a good effort .
we had a mixed experience here today .
did i really just pay $ _num_ for this ?
waited _num_ min to be seated .
had terrible service and almost left .
hard to find parking at this mall .
experience tells me this is not a good sign .
i wish that was all there was to say .
the service was slow , and minimal at best .
big wait for a big let down .
food and beer were good but the atmosphere sucked .
are you kidding me ?
i visit this location very often .
i rarely have a bad experience .
my bacon cheese burger was dry and bland too .
one of the worst experiences ever .
was busy but not crazy crowded .
waitress was not attentive .
nothing quite like a dip sandwich with no dip .
our waters continued to stay empty .
i 'm just very disappointed with this visit .
like , blatantly says he has an incompetent staff .
nothing was a priority to her .
not sure but felt so disrespected .
we will not go back !

it cramped and this is not it .
would not give this location any business .
i could n't find the place .

but i will be avoiding this starbucks location .
_num_ % off selected items ?
both times i 've been beyond disappointed with service .
horrible horrible customer service !
and again , test came back negative .
i was busy , so my mom brought him .
i would avoid coming here at all costs .
this office is a nightmare of incompetence .
_num_ weeks for a lens repair .
_num_ days to ship from new york to arizona .

i can not speak to their repair work .
the service was snobby and rude .
the service is clearly substandard and snobby .
zero respect for other peoples time .
the flemings potatos were terrible !
our drinks sat empty quite often .
i would expect better .
i wont lie , these were amazing !
this place has gone downhill big time !
so everyone else had to watch me eat .
i was very disappointed .
i left extremely disappointed with both .

our visit lasted exactly _num_ minutes .
that , we did , unfortunately .
nothing else on my plate , just the steak .
i will not be going back ... diner beware !
i know , i know .
for the price i would not go there again .
too expensive for mid level quality .
and this place has never been comparable .
for the prices , go to capital grille !
chandler is pretty disappointing with there options of restaurants .
not worth the drive .
lots of money for not much quality .
the mashed potatoes were flavorless .
overall , the seasoning of the food was substandard .
flemings you deserve and have better servers .
the hostess stand was really disorganized .
lastly , no draft beer .
not everyone wants a $ _num_ glass of cabernet .
was n't a great experience .
maybe skip this location .
point is , no one touched the table .
do not have any reasons to return .
pains me to say it was a disappointment .
tonight , however was a different story .
the truffle mashed potatoes were good .
she did not eat but one bite .
i will not be returning .
it was a waste of my hard earned money .
_num_ turned into all day .
i will never step foot in this store again .
food was not so good .
is it always so bland ?
i wanted so much to like pei wei .
i went twice , getting different dishes both times .
it was very disappointing .
first , it was not extra spicy at all .
i believe normally this is not the case here .
today i am on the fence .
im thinking they were just having a bad day .
nothing like the advertisement .
shame on that manager .
the food was n't worth it .
i 'm never going back .
this time , they used round noodles .
no , they were vermicelli .
but , would i recommend pei wei to anyone ?
even panda express is better than this place .
the place was a disaster .
the sight was gross .
they served me raw beef .
prob wo n't return to this location .
good gosh this place has run downhill .
worst experience i ever had .
the food was horrible .
the honey seared chicken was over cooked and tough .
the worst part was going to the restroom .
it 's too bad .
it was soggy and had fatty pieces in it .
the lettuce was junk lettuce .
warning ... ... rip off ... .
these people are horrible .
i would not recommend them to anyone !
i was very disappointed today .

now i know why i avoid this place .
really needs a remodel and new management .
just bad customer service imho !
i will never patronize this pig pen ever again !
it was $ _num_ for my subpar omelette .
they give other dennys a bad name .
bottom line , slow , rude , dirty .
they lost two clients .
he 's _num_ years old .
it 's not about $ _num_ .
this is vet place not a bank .
i would not recommend this business at all .
all they want is money .

are you effing kidding me ?
terrible place to live .
worst chinese food i have ever eaten .
you have been warned .
will not go back .
this is some extremely terrible chinese food .
the general sauce taste like pure salt .
there are no vegetables or egg or taste .
it was n't the right color either .
it tasted very salty too .
some of the broccoli was yellow as well .
even the fortune cookie was bland .
not really my idea of good time .
and this place has changed for the worse .
want a crap load of peanuts ?
a restaurant with peanut shells all over the place .
however , i did n't really expect much .
the wings are nothing special at all .
there is really nothing special about this place .
the fries were soggy and not crisp at all .
burger was not as juicy as other places .
it just felt dry .
either big fries , skinny fries , or tots .
those burgers are not worth $ _num_ a piece .
the only thing that tasted good was my coke .
i do n't see us going back .
ca n't beat their wings .
wo n't even order it again .
i am so frustrated !
food was too dry .
most unprofessional place i have ever been .
if i could rate a no stars i would .
this place is the definition of awful .
the apartments look nothing like them .
it looks like a _num_ 's motel room .
i 'm still disgusted .
they just do n't care !
you 've been warned .
do not rent from this complex !
my entire experience with this complex was horrible .
totally ruined my mood .
do not go to these people .
one star because i ca n't give less .
i hate pushy sales people .
i was very careful too .
they made me wait _num_ hour to fix it .
do not spend money here they are evil !
no one said a word .
worst mcdonalds experience ever .
avoid this one folks .
drink was somewhat flat .
there were several other choices i could have made .
you would be wrong .
he did not want to spend time with us .
what does this _num_ year old kid know .
where is the negative star review ?
it feels dead inside .
just like a big warehouse , no ambiance .
i felt `` wrong '' for having gone there .
one star is far too kind .
awesome follow through ... not !
that was march _num_ .
probably would have saved $ _num_ grand .
when they did respond they were rude .
he was very slow .
do n't bother with this company !
also , is n't a pedicure about your feet ?
i tried the door and it was locked .
this place is a rip off .
it was pretty gross .
big ones and baby ones .
but warning ... do n't do takeout there .
ok nothing to be impressed with here .
the chicken taco was soggy .
it is cheap , i will say that much .
my veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot .
it was mostly a disappointment after that .
shredded iceberg does n't count !
they took over _num_ minutes to deliver our order .
wo n't go back ... ick .
i mean , it was worse than taco bell .
`` you just want your dollar back ? ''
oh man , now she was pissed .
_num_ minutes for _num_ tacos is crazy .
i doubt ill ever return to this establishment .
unfortunately it did not live up to expectations .
the burro was good , but messy .
after a few bites the whole burro fell apart .
but i will not be ordering a burro .
sadly , it went downhill from there .
i am a complete fish lover .
i checked out their website -- not too shabby !
the food , the service , utterly disappointing .
so i sat on a book aisle .
must be having a bad day or something .
it was very busy in the whole store .
do not get nails done here !
did n't thank me for the tip .
did n't have black nail polish ?
who does n't have black nail polish ?
did n't even last a week !
plus tip , for all that mess !
i did not have a good experience at all .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
they are rude , inappropriate and so unprofessional !
it ultimately ruined our day .
extremely disappointed with the whole experience .
slowest fast food in america .
the hashbrowns were mushy and barely warm .
both our meals seemed just barely warm .
$ _num_ for two , you be the judge .
overall , probably wont be back for breakfast .
the food was disgusting .
there is a pizza hut across the street .
could n't have been more disappointed !
food was n't good enough to be mediocre .
no beans , chicken , cheese , nothing .
the yelp reviews lead us wrong this time .
i got the chicken fried steak .
it was just plain nasty .
btw no alcohol at all .
the food was greasy and bland .
the waitress was friendly but it felt forced .
i drove _num_ miles one way .
nothing has been done that we can see .
way to say you 're sorry .

i will never return here .
never would of thought this would cost so much .
very bad and expensive company .
avoid this place and save your money !
the fries were soggy and greasy .

but not right by me .
we stopped here and that was a huge mistake .

this is extremely bad customer service and completely unprofessional .
avoid at all costs .
the staff are loud in the mornings .
but stay away from this company .
the customer service is horrible .
i was amazed how unprofessional the company was .
unprofessional , no call back and no email back .
completely waste _num_ dollars .
lindsay confirmed this and the process started .
so one of the two still has not closed .
worst customer service imaginable .
after the it went down the drain .
i used to give it _num_ stars .
things seem to have gone downhill .
potatoes tasted funky in the yellow curry too .
way too long to get food .
i was dead wrong .
sorry to write this bad review .
the quality of the food is not there .
we would not go back to this restaurant again .
we ate here once and will never go back .
the pad thai had no flavor .

c'mon mcdonalds , get your stuff together !
the service at night is beyond bad .
it 's often a bit dirty to boot .
the fries were soggy and disgusting as well .
is n't that why we go there ?
asked for no onions got lump of pickles .
what once was a treat is truly crap .
no you ca n't go back .
no longer healthy - seems like bait and switch .
i 'm disappointed in your corporate decisions .
i tried but again they failed .
i am so angry .
i will never go to sonic again .
remind me never to drive thru here again .
if i check-in again - shoot me .
i asked for no mayo and got mayo .
that pretty much ruins the burger .
caused her to ask `` is this chicken ? ''
she 's _num_ , and not that picky .
so that must have been pretty bad .
we also substituted onion rings for fries .
the chicken was disgusting ... _num_ % inedible !
this was a horrible disappointment !
this place is awful .
i was quoted around $ _num_ at the screen .
i checked my receipt , sure enough $ _num_ .
i checked my bank account , $ _num_ .
well i 'm not stupid .
that 's just absolutely ridiculous to me .
i get it , mistakes happen .
nothing was ever acknowledged , there was no apology .
also , nothing has a price tag on it .
they do n't even know the price .
they also are not overly helpful or friendly .
guess they do n't need my money .
all of this only cost $ _num_ .
it was a disappointment .
would not recommend ever .
crab puffs are ok , large portion size .
it 's not my favorite .
it does n't appear or smell the cleanest .
this lady almost killed me with her bad dentistry .
nothing to say taking my review down !
it 's kinda ... crap .
well , not kind of , it is .
i 've been there on about _num_ different occasions .
hell to the no .
this was pathetic beyond description .
i can only describe the food as flavorless .
_num_ minutes to get check .
the food is a bit overpriced and very mediocre .
similar prices but better atmosphere and way better food !
overpriced , flavorless , and poor quality .
the food here is not good .
$ _num_ for a single taco ?

the servers are condescending , lazy & rude .
terrible food and a pushy waiter !
not good at all and had a funny taste .
he just kept coming back and coming back .
mine had no seasoning at all .
the rice was old and hard .
the drinks were horrible .
the kids meals do n't include a drink .
but they failed the test on every level !
my waitress no where to be found .
i have eaten only two bites .
waitress comes over gets money .
they were very rude and had horrible attitudes .
i understand if someone has a bad day .
but customers should never feel uncomfortable !
it 's like a toss of a coin .
we had the lunch special and were extremely disappointed .
the food left a lot to be desired .
you wo n't see me again anytime soon .
i give _num_ stars because my food was disgusting .
this was not authentic mexican food .
the rice and beans had no flavor .

service was friendly but food was totally nasty .
but the pharmacy is horrible .
i was so mad when i left this place .
very rude and not accomodating at all .
huh , i must really be missing something here .
i counted at least _num_ customers in the salon .
my nail tech was bad .
the manicure was bad too .
does n't look good .
we had a horrible experience .
too bad i left work to get them done .
i arrive _num_ minutes early .
seriously i have never been treated so rudely .

i will never walk into this shop again .

she does n't acknowledge me and is rude .
she was extremely rough and even cut my toe .
i hate this place .
they did a horrible job on my gel manicure .
most likely will not return .
i would not recommend this place at all .
i 'll still go there for pedicures .
no one ever suggested i do that at elite .
staff attitude was awkward .
they kept taking other clients before me too .
i am so disappointed .
cheesy elevator music is playing overhead .
the english spoken was very poor .
my toes looked dumb .
their sushi menu is a bit confusing as well .
they charged me for my mistake .
this restaurant is not authentic .
so this place is not an exception .
- cream cheese , tempura .
this place also did not get the rice right .
over kill with the rice vinegar + sugar .
not good for takeout .
i just cancelled my order and went elsewhere .
except a bit slow .
the prices are n't that high .
but , the sushi items , rolls , etc .
my next sushi experience will be elsewhere .
they did not list any of their entrees .
to be honest the worst experience of my life .
they were just rude to me and my husband .
if i could i would put no stars !
but sadly , i was very disappointed !
she rudely told me `` price _num_ ! ''
so tired of the bs .
worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
i ca n't believe i was treated this way .
this place is not worth the headache .
food was just ok and the service was marginal .
not again for me .
it was extremely dry and overcooked !
the mango roll came and was extremely boring .
there were _num_ tables in the place .
incredibly rude to say the least .
do n't waste ur money here .
bad reviews are a bitch !
i 've never had such awful food before .
it was worse than bad fast food .
chicken is n't supposed to be grey , right ?
that was not the case however .
two totally different restaurants with the same name .
chandler location is the total opposite .
i think that 's being a little cheap .
will not be returning .
this location and owner is the worst !
their commitment to customer service sucks .
rip off , rude , incompetent .
please avoid just brakes .
incompetent and take forever this place !
they kept my car way too long !
get outta here and stop trying to scam people .
do n't go to just brakes !
the total cost was $ _num_ .
i will not recommend this vet .
i will try to be short .
i 've taken my dogs here for _num_ years .
and no explanation was ever offered !
after tonight though , i 'll probably never return .
discount pays for this repair only through network .
in my opinion , they are not honest .
very arrogant , with terrible bedside manner .
he just said flat out no .
he cant walk , sleep , function .
avoid this doctor at all costs .
terrible experience with getting refills .
i hate this place !
incompetent doctor ( s ) and office staff .
i 'm glad i looked it up .
they said no , but no apology . )
i will not be coming back .
shame on you gilbert center for family medicine .
this place is the worst .
i dread my visits .
terrible , awful experience .
the receptionists are rude and nasty .
there is no concern for people or the patient .
this made me late for work .
i waited in small room for _num_ minutes .
it was about _num_ minutes and then gone .
just walked out the room and cancel the appt .
this was not the case at all .
i am incredibly unhappy and disappointed .
this place does not even deserve one star .
i 'm disgusted and so disappointed with this clinic .
it 's not only me .
what a horrible experience with this clinic .
why wasting time dealing with all this hassle .
do not use this groomer !
al 's is no more .
plenty of chicken and mushrooms .
to be fair , it was takeout .
but i do n't think that made any difference .
i will not be back .
it was _num_ minutes before 9pm .
we were sorely disappointed .
every single dish was flat and flavorless .
neither of our dishes came with rice .
poor old man working all by himself .
the place was empty .
the food was barely edible .
wo n't be coming back .
there was absolutely no pork .
the coconut soup was just mediocre at best .
it still leaked afterwards .
i ca n't help but not feel cheated .
sent my wife home crying .
this location is a complete joke .
without him , i would give this zero stars .
never get tires at fletcher !
to fix a flat ?
ultimately , i left without receiving service .
save yourself the headache do business elsewhere .
so , she paid the bill .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
hello that 's why people make appointments .
i just did not have tools to do it .
i just did not have tools to do it .
are we going back ?
we were kind of disappointed .
fish was very skimpy and not good .
according to them they were bland .
overall , not a great experience .
first off , i 'm a chimichanga freak .
$ _num_ for a chimi plate .
is it a sit down place ?
do they bring me my food ?
they were n't even freshly made chips !
just rubbed me the wrong way .
that was almost unbearable .
all in all , lulu 's is just okay .
when the chips came they were cold and gross .
there was hardly any meat on the tacos .
sorry wo n't be going back !
lulu 's is my first attempt .
the burrito was almost flat ... almost nothing inside .
very skimpy for the price .
and did n't even give me i contact .
that 's just ridiculous .
beans tasteless and of course rice same thing .
looks like a family run business and nobody cares .
good location , horrible food , and horrible prices .
probably wo n't be coming back any time soon .
very expensive for nothing !
nothing worse than terribly old ice tea !
the refried beans were very runny .
the chicken was dry .
i could be wrong .
nothing to really stand out .
the lady at the cash register is so rude !
trust me , be warned and pick another restaurant .

all the other tvs are over _num_ years old .
my son is in the army and _num_ .
never had a problem .
went anyway , thinking maybe she was just busy .
nasty bar with awful service !
i wish i could give this bar zero stars .
wait staff was not friendly .
dark , dingy , wo n't ever visit again !
are you kidding me ?
very unhappy with the treatment that i received .
no , it was n't .
sadly , i was disappointed .
not my kind of music either .
this place sucked , even for gilbert .
so not my scene .
not my scene at all .
but it was just a strange feeling and layout .
stop over charging for drinks .
the food is mediocre , service and atmosphere terrible .
horrible atmosphere , horrible service .
sat for _num_ minutes and never got served .
left for mexican restaurant across the street .
more like crappy don 's ... .
i do not recommend this facility to anyone .
i would not suggest using this florist .
i repeat , do n't come here !
this is no business but a joke !
rude service when i asked what the problem was .
do n't waste your time or money !
i was so frustrated by that conversation .
two of us went for yearly exam .
the total time before leaving was _num_ hours .
and examination did n't seem thorough .
not impressed ; i do not recommend .
their coffee is terrible , too .
beyond that , i kind of hate this place .
it 's just annoying how crowded this place is .
not at all what i ordered .
i stopped going here after my last visit .
the food is great , the service is terrible !
ordered bagels last week for my team of forty .
she kept giving me cheap ones .
the last two times have been poor .
she said nothing to acknowledge that .
she never said anything to me .
worst customer service , ever .
i will not visit this location again .
not impressed with this place .
unfortunately this one is not well maintained or staffed .
employees come in late an nobody seems to care .
on a crowded morning it is a mess .
very little salmon and green tomatoes .
cups of stuff laying around behind the counter everywhere .
she handed me my coffee and i left .
terrible service at this location .
that guy sucks . ''
i was so insulted by this .
now it 's worthless !
the staff is unorganized and very sloppy !
i do so for their consistent disappointment !
strangely , they say there is nothing on it .
avoid this store - and probably jamba juice completely !
there is not much of customer service at all .
atmosphere - gets my top rating .
i hate to say it .
the chips & salsa that followed were completely underwhelmed .
one word : dull .
no thanks , i need to taste something !
it is just a typical chain restaurant .
i just will not eat here anymore .
i was not impressed with this place .
the salsa was horrible .
even the margaritas left a lot to be desired .
there are way better mexican restaurants out there .
got the salsa but no chips !
i ate here before , never a problem .
bad , bad , bad .
salsa tasted like tomato sauce .
neither my husband nor i could finish the food .
the service was terrible .
i will no longer go there after tonight .
i ... do n't get it .
unfortunately , we were not seated with menus .
well that was disappointing .
that would 've been a mistake .
_num_ minutes after ordering our entrees showed up .
could n't taste the seafood at all .
what a total waste of _num_ hours .
first of all , the hostess was plain weird .
second , too much crap on the table .
might i suggest an awesome place ?
this was not good .
the place looks amazing but the food is terrible .
will not go here again .
food was n't anything amazing .
here is where the wheels fell off .
ultimately , all orders were taken .
entirely too long for mexican food of any quality .
very bland and flavorless .
the mahi mahi was very very dry .
the rice was very plain .
even the salsa was bland !
pollo rico was dry .
chips and salsa tasted like pace .
i spent $ _num_ for a lousy lunch .
i wo n't go back .
i ordered chicken enchiladas with verde sauce .
there was nothing `` verde '' about it .
secondly , we wait _num_ for our waitress .
the food was pretty bland .
which is so not true !
attempted to give this restaurant another shot .
it did not go well .
this location in gilbert is awful .
needs no approval right ?
the problem with this location is the food .
i was extremely disappointed .
but it 's my fault for trying this location .
gilbert will probably just have _num_ .
late sunday brunch with my husband .
the rice was bland .
we probably wo n't be back .
we were there at noon and it was dead !
i can make a better margarita with bottled mixture .
the food was slow and the service even slower .
may or may not come back for awhile .
it is listed as $ _num_ .
it is simply not worth the wait .
this place was shockingly terrible .
we were extremely disappointed .
however , this chain failed !
the pizza was a mess .
under cooked and way too much sauce .
pizza is ok and the pasta dishes are horrible .
they have no idea what customer service is .
by the time we got it it was cold .
_num_ star because the cold pizza was edible .
the service here was extremely sub par .
we got home and the order was totally wrong .
too little too late .
it was 8pm and my pregnant wife was starving .
i would never go back here though .
) ; breaded mushrooms .
seriously ... who cares .
i so want to like this place .
let 's just say we ate in silence tonight .
the food was below standard for anyone .
the pizza hardly had any flavor .
the cheese way overpowered the sauce .
literally just the sauce .
i 've have hotter better pizza from little caesars .
the pizza barely had any sauce on it .
i could see the crust in some areas .
we 've had better pizza and wings elsewhere .
the pizza and wings were luke warm .
do you not go to this place !
i ordered _num_ extra large pizzas and _num_ wings .
bottom line this place needs the owners attention badly .
both were drowned in a salty sauce .
we will not be going back .
gave it my usual _num_ tries .
the portions were so small we left hungry .
not going back there ever again .
wish i tried a different place .
i lost my appetite .
even the fortune cookie was stale .
$ _num_ dollars of crap .
you 'd be better off going to panda .
get gas every _num_ miles and not fill up ?
i really like the area around here .
the apartments themselves are not much to speak of .
i think it 's just really cheap carpet .
i would give them zero stars if possible .
but this was n't even the real issue .
if i could give a zero , i would .
it does not matter if you make an apt .
the technicians here are so insanely rude .
and i might add , they never asked .
honesty is not something they are familiar with .
slowly but surely it was as bad as before .
i am not just some _num_ year old kid .
i backed off to get my free alignment .
we will not return as customers or recommend them .
do n't judge me at the counter .
just do n't need it .
they just do n't care .
the rice was hard and the beans were cold .
that was a terrible example for mexican food tonight .
wo n't be coming back here again !
beans are always bland .
even the hot sauce is weird at this one .
greasy spoon drive thru mexican food .
so gross , disgusted for life now .
im glad i took my business elsewhere .
no eye contact , no manners .
horrible service and horrible attitudes from staff .
no customer service skills and food was ok .
employees got bad attitudes & not helpful at all .
the shoe department is hit or miss .
this store is a total disgrace .
pretty disgusting in how little pride is taken .
they act like they dont even care .
this place is really lacking customer service and training .
the whole mens section is a total wreck .
this visit was back in november .
- so ... very ... .
i would n't order it again though .
my wife did n't want to eat them .
thin but not cracker crisp .
their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings .
most of them just looked dry .
repeat visits are not very great .
the place is utter chaos .
very sad experience , bad service , no apologies .

very , very rude staff .
you have lost a good customer .
but ... the cuban sandwich had absolutely no flavor .
he took a bite and dumped the rest .
the bison burger did n't redeem the meal .
but for now , skip the cake !
dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor .
i was completely ignored .
overpriced and ridiculous set up .
very rude experience today waiting for takeout .
the asian cucumber salad was bland .
the toasted pecans immediately fell out .
maybe i just had a bad experience .
it looked old and tasted that way too .
also tried the icecream cookie .
that is the only thing here i would recommend .
i had a salad and could n't finish it .
the desserts are not that special either .
terribly managed , just ok food .
that 's why i gave this place two stars .
the potatoes were to die for !
his fries were not that good .
i tried them and i was disappointed as well .
the food here is ok .
i will not be returning .
i recommend the food but not the experience .
it was truly a disappointment .
the toasted brie and sausage were ok .
if i could give it no stars i would .
the people at liberty market where so incredibly rude !
the pasta salad was bad .
not the most efficient way to get your food .
however , today was not the same .
all my hip friends said to try this place .
wet , gooey batter .
but instead i bought a cookie and left .
these people have no business doing breakfast .
unless i need a cookie .
you can not run without paying the bill .
this staff needs massive training on customer service .
they had already stopped serving breakfast .
we wo n't be going back .
where has all the customer service gone ?
to my disappointment , they did n't come through .
i 'm so disappointed .
will not even give store credit .
i can find quality furniture elsewhere with better service .
just literally continued to scream .
told us he did not want our business .
they will not have our business .
avoid any conversations with the manager at all costs .
the place was almost empty .
it reads no beans on the screen .
they put $ _num_ charge on your credit card !
never , never again !
pumps do n't work and staff was no help !
that 's why i want them rotated .
that 's not honest business . ''
wasted my time and money !
my husband said no thats fine .
i 'm not sure why it took so long !
my stomach will probably let me know later .
same odd taste again !
i smelled it and not the right smell either .
what really bothered me was the rolls .
for all-you-can-eat sushi i 'm not expecting the world .
i would n't even give it a second date .
the spicy tuna roll tasted off .
the albacore tuna had a very weird consistency .
the ayce deal is a rip off .
i would eat supermarket sushi over the place .
i went to this vet back in _num_ .
my gel was terrible .
will not go back , manager was rude .
i went originally because the reviews were good .

a fat chunk of it .
and continued to file them .
no thank you or anything .
i highly suggest not going here !
she apologized but did not change her technique .
i will not be back !
i asked for a fake set manicure .
these people have horrible customer service .

the pizza was gross .
the staff was rude as hell .
do n't make promises that are an hour off .
_num_ minutes later , pizza boy shows up .
to me , there is no professionalism there .

zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures .
i guess i 'm just spoiled .
they were very unprofessional and slow .
i will not be going back to this doctor .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
and he said , `` nothing . ''
and then walked away from me .
do n't waste your time !
no one was in the place .
customer service does not exist here !
it is actually quite sad .
this school has completely failed my child .
only _num_ barbers _num_ chairs go figure .
no way burger was cooked on grill that fast .
food is very mediocre .
the blizzard that was already half melted .
dont bother going through this drive thru .
first , it 's not free .
the spoon does n't even fall out !
why is the staff so rude ?
do you always waste bags when serving blizzards ?
small town feel , but too cramped .
liberty market is a much better bet for brunch .
but it was n't particularly tasty .
so we go there there are _num_ open tables .
they would n't even look at us or anything .
very small place and very annoying place .
i ordered the long john with mushrooms .
third time trying breakfast here too .
probably go elsewhere next time .
and a sliced potato on the side .
prices did n't seem appropriate for food .
our family of _num_ looked forward to breakfast .
either she is clueless or a liar .
the rudeness was an insult !

no one deserves to be treated that way .
she rang me up without it .
owner rude and not customer oriented .

nothing like disappointment for dinner .

his wife borders on rude .
this place has the absolute worst customer service .
the time on the watch was n't even set .

i only get tips done .
this place is horrible .
i assume they offer some sort of senior day .
i told them _num_ pedicures and _num_ manicure .
polish was not even .
it was a very disappointing experience here .
however , i felt rushed through the process .

notice that there was nobody else in the restaurant .
she did n't want to give it to me .
she was not pleasant about it .
she looked dreadful and her attitude sucked .

but they have the worst service .
we only live _num_ minutes away .
we waited another _num_ minutes and still no delivery .

it looked like someone threw up sauce over everything .
even the crust was incredibly salty .
ill start by saying do not eat here !
it ruined all of my food .
it was not good .
i would n't even feed it to my dog .
too bad they were .
hit or miss , this joint .
selection is n't too good at this one .
admittedly more good than bad .
i just said ok , and left .
plus the store feels dirty .
absolutely the worst mani/pedi place in town .
the owner was extremely rude .
i will not ever go back .
poor service and very disappointed with my mani/pedi .
they are rude and only want your money .
they only care about quantity and not quality .
too bad you ca n't do negative stars .
this is the worst nail place ever .
no thanks barro 's .
it was cold and soggy .
she was also rude and impatient and seemed distracted .
there was no sauce on it at all .
i would n't recommend them anymore .
i waited _num_ mins for chicken wings .
honestly , the worst i have ever had .
i will not go back .
probably expected too much ... .
do n't bother visiting this location .
disgusting waste of money .
no employee in sight .
i even wandered around looking for one .
god i hate that parking lot .
sort of ridiculous if you ask me .
this location is really busy .
i could not believe my ears .
i said `` no thanks '' and left .
sushi here was a disgrace today .
money , money , money .
this is business ... lets not pretend other wise .

that is unfortunate and cheap .
it 's been $ _num_ always !
the stripper ripped me off !
it 's not the money it 's the principle !
this place is the worst !

we ended up buying _num_ tickets for $ _num_ .
in fact - nothing , totally dark and empty !
do n't these people own a hose ?
i could n't even imagine eating them !
and macaroni salad ... it was n't good .
so was the veggie beef soup .
customer service is bad .
not so much anymore .
complete and total lack of customer service .
worst nail salon ever .
waste of time and money .
they would n't try a color on me .
seriously , go spend your money elsewhere .
a pedi is supposed to be relaxing .
just not very thorough work .
i literally get the same gel manicure every time .
it 's very frustrating .
no ... dont go here .
no hand lotion used after , no massage either .
i wish i had gone somewhere else .
do not try to sell jewelry to this place !
these people are hoping to rip you off .
london gold was a rude experience .
screw me once , but never again !
high pressure salespeople make for an unpleasant experience .
wo n't be going back .
they do not have enough staff to do business .
the location is also so outdated .
be prepared to wait wait wait !
i dread going here once a month .
that does n't sound too bad .
so why the _num_ stars , you ask ?
i could n't believe it !
but wait , there 's more .
kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth .
the pastrami was pretty dry and lacked flavor .
i doubt i would come back to this place .
what a disappointment today !
i demanded my money back .
you like stopping free falls .
this deli is mediocre at best .
service on the other end , very poor .
clean , flavorful , not salty .
really , i 'm not kidding .
this is not a real jewish deli .
it does n't come close .
all you could taste was the bread .
_num_ dollars for an egg salad sandwich !
the meal was not delivered together .
someone could have slipped on the floor .
i like low prices .
do not trust this jeweler .
this location is dirty and disorganized .
the staff are hard to find .
i 'll avoid this location from now on .
save your money for another location or different restaurant .
if not , stay away .
i guess it 's my own fault .
i would avoid this location .
worst customer service ever .
this mcdonalds has officially lost me as a customer .
the worst customer service that i have ever experienced .
it 's so not worth the few bucks saved .
super disappointed in the kids shoe selection .
the selection available at this store is just terrible .
this might as well be an outlet store .
what a waste of money !
warning : do not take your car here !
_num_ hour and $ _num_ later .
do not take your care here .
this one consistently sucks !
do not take your car here .
vacuuming was also poor .

and they did a crappy job on my car .
i just bought a groupon for a vip wash .
so , this past weekend , it went in .
terrible wash , and even worse customer service .
i got the _num_ basic wash .
not worth the time or money .

so much for my loyalty to az auto wash .
an absolute joke and waste of time and money .

the inside has been scratched up too .
they ruined my paint and interior .
i really can not believe it .
the worst car wash i 've ever gotten !

the barista was a very nasty women .
she was unfriendly and flat out rude .
hands down worst starbucks i have ever been to !
now i sadly avoid it .
there was n't anyone else behind me !
what a ridiculous experience i had at this starbucks .
this place sold me two used table lamps .
they need some customer service training badly !
do n't stay here .
they did not care .
not a word was spoken about my stay .
i have stayed here from time to time .
hardly worth a wait .
but i am not that confused .
overpriced ... not all that good .
we both walked away thinking wtf ?
for a steakhouse that was very disappointing .
sorry flemings , we will not be back .
now that 's really bad !
creme brulee dessert was not better than the keg .
service was snooty and slow .
left a sour taste in my mouth .
even so , it was n't about the money .
did n't take it off the bill either .
not classy way to handle .
now to the big disappointment .
overall , just a bad cut of meat !
no ambiance , no windows but quieter .
he was happy , i was not .
the salad was really tiny , not sure why .
no one approached our table .
not to my taste .
after around _num_ mins we put our order in .
i get better steaks from the market .
this past sunday 's experience fell short .
not this scottsdale location .
she normally does this but ok .
but we will not go here again .
once seated , service continued to be slow .
otherwise would have rated our visit tonight a _num_ .
we dined with them and was so disappointed .
service was horrible and the food was substandard .
would not recommend this place to anyone .
the night was more of a disappointment from there .
why would he recommend something he had never tried .
for a $ _num_ meal it is outrageous .
im not going back here.
scratch this one off the list .
terrible service- terrible food .
stopped by last night shortly after opening .
not a high end restaurant .
overpriced with mediocre food .
i suggest you do not patronize .
they are all about corporate , not the individual .
i will not patronize this establishment again .
what an awful experience .
i gave the hostess my name and reservation time .
she blew me off .
we did n't care !
not even an email .
do n't waste your time or hard earned money .
so no i 'm not a snob .
they did n't even acknowledge our wait .
please do n't waste your time or money here .
this place is disgusting .
i have not eaten there since .
customer service is horrible !
i decide not to order from this place .
i will not eat from here again , ever .
the pizza was extremely bland , absolutely no flavor !
waste of twenty bucks !
tonight i placed an order for pickup .
she tells me _num_ minutes .
good food , but poorly managed .
will not be customers again unless management changes .
tonight really was the icing on the cake .
the service was awful .
seriously , go to frys and buy your own .
the meat was way over cooked , crispy !
worst customer service i have ever dealt with .
woman who answered the phone was extremely rude .
she immediately became very irritated with this request .
was missing items in my order .
btw the pizza was average , nothing special .
a very weak experience .
this was my first experience ordering their pizza .
this place is the worst .
i was less than one block away .
if you do so you 'll be highly disappointed .
not the end of the world .
second time did n't go too well at all .
it was as hard as a piece of cardboard .
this restaurant has done nothing but gone downhill .
we all hated it .
the over done pizza was inedible .
oh but my garlic knots were way over cooked .
avoid at all costs !
it is extremely inconvenient .
i will never purchase anything from lowe 's again .
i passed _num_ hd 's on the way over .
this was a lousy experience .
they contract out installers who are useless .
i missed a day of work for that b.s .
selection on what we needed was poor , too !
once i basically ran into one he was helpful .
i am so disappointed .
they are functional , but this is so disappointing .
do n't have any custom work done .
worst store for follow up or assistance .
however , his condescending tone truly irritated me .
customer service is a joke .
hopefully its just isolated to this location .
and here is where i should have walked out .
they have lost my business for anything , forever .
i will never buy carpet from this lowes store .
the manager only said they were sorry .
transferred _num_ times , _num_ minutes on hold .
this $ _num_ ad is a lie .
do n't waste your time go somewhere else .
this perfect teeth location is a shame .
no greeting and nothing else .
this place is the definition of `` rude . ''
i recommend not even thinking going to this dentist !
my ring started to turn gold .
gold is not me .
plus , it was confusing .
blue diamond was so convenient for me .
let down enough to never return .
do not go here under any circumstances !
their food is garbage .
i did not like their food or service .
: ( a million sad faces for me .
everything was cold , except the beans oddly enough .
the taco meat was cold .
the cheese enchilada was cold .
i do n't get it .
everything is made very cheap with no quality ingredients .
my advice ... go elsewhere .
i 'd rather make the drive out to la .
what it 's only _num_ or _num_ hours away .
it 's a sucker bet .
the dressing for the salad was bitter and weird .
i was left feeling disappointed .
the nigiri sushi is n't that fresh .
iced green tea was very yummy .
this was not the case last night .
there was one sliced tomato and no mushrooms .
the third will be explained in detail .
the other three were pretty disgusting .
i 'm never going back here , ew .
sakana is another typical sushi place .
thats not how you run a business .
and couldnt get out of there fast enough .
the service however , could use an overhaul .
this place is not your typical sushi place .
this place is like american sushi bar .
not a good time .
this place does n't care about those details .
for those that are n't , skip it .
am i paying for the styrofoam container ?
no other types of fish .
the only flavor that stood out was the salmon .
but the service here is terrible .
the service was horrible .
the atmosphere is the worst .
i do n't understand all the outstanding reviews .
it was mushy and gross .
it 's the worst sushi i 've ever had .
what is going on with these stellar reviews ?
this place is so bad .
the rolls were also falling apart and very mushy .
not worth the value .
the soft shell crab roll was pretty near disgusting .
it was burnt and soggy .
even the vegas roll was less than .
the sushi that i had was not fresh .
imitation crab meat is not real seafood .
just poor quality fish , no attention to detail .
it sushi not fine dining .
third : why would you turn away paying customers ?
also carpet in a sushi restaurant is disgusting .
the food is mediocre but the service is terrible .
their customer service is atrocious .
i think this company is a scam .
this place was not helpful to say the least .
the offices do not have great views .
rude service with a locals only attitude .
that makes sense ... not .
very slow pace of play too .
do not recommend this course at all .
not a marshall in sight !
wo n't be back .
overall not worth the $ _num_ i spent .
the service here is terrible .
not sure anyone even cares .
other plants that we had paid for were not .
again , no apologies , could care less .
i would not recommend spending a dime here .
this is where the _num_ stars come in .
which again makes no sense .
do n't waste your time at this nursery .
do not use this company .
ill admit it , i 'm an idiot .
both options were unacceptable .
salesman stopped answering my calls and my questions .
it is just unacceptable .
no call at all .
really crappy service in my mind .
the worst service experience ever !
they do n't deserve my business or yours .
the worst service experience ever !
they do n't deserve my business or yours .
it had $ _num_ on the tag .
you 've been warned .
worst customer service i have ever had .
long waits on time for people to get back .
landscape designer did n't know what she was doing .
i would not use them ever again .
scrambled looking eggs with slices of cheese on top .
greasy noisy expensive questionable quality rude .
matzo ball chicken soup was good .
not worth my time ... literally .
very over priced and not very high quality .
of course the orders were wrong and ice cold .
tasteless pastrami that was _num_ % fat .
forgot the other soups and then brought them cold .
the food was bad .
no apology , nothing .
he practically blamed us for being too impatient !
we will not be back !
my husband was also not impressed with his food .
so i 'll lay it out like this .
do n't waste your money or appetite !
first , the service was horrendous .
ill be back tomorrow for some more bagels .
service leaves a little to be desired .
he told me they were _num_ cents extra .
are you kidding me ?
was so angry , had to walk out .
i was extremely disappointed .
so i wait , and wait , and wait .
_num_ more minutes and its finally done .
i will not be visiting this place again .
breakfast on saturday at 10:30 am .
not one because i would have stated the problem .
and the place was not even that busy .
this place is just ok.
food is mediocre and service is horrible .
slow as hell for carry out .
the guy behind me gave up and left .
our waitress never came over to check on us .
their prices are beyond ridiculous .
not the most welcoming feeling .
why does this keep happening ?
we were treated horribly and will never return .
i do n't want to come back .
upon first entering , it 's a little confusing .
the menu is extensive , and everything sounds delish .
i 'm disappointed with the ambiance .
not the best , not the worst .
i considered my $ _num_ tab a bit steep .
yes , but probably just for take-out .
this place is horrible !
it just was n't worth it in my opinion .
_num_ minute waiting time was to be expected .
there was zero table side service .
tomato slices were not ripe .
scrambled eggs were okay .
they should close an hour earlier then !
the bagel which i requested toasted was luke warm .
it was a bad meal .
we could only eat the scrambled eggs .
wish i could give zero stars .
i can not express enough ... avoid this restaurant .
baked goods look lovely but are bland and blah .
service is crazy disorganized and slow .
was getting ready to get up and leave .
would n't go back .
( two breakfast sandwiches and two bagels ) .
it was okay but bland .
also the sourdough bread requested was not sourdough received .
bad news , it was frozen in the center .
service was terrible as usual .
about half the size of a regular chicken breast .
so far , this was a disaster dining experience .
the corned beef was served cold and was terrible .
the hot brisket was ice cold and tasteless .
i was disappointed in breakfast this morning .
the massages ranged from mediocre to pretty good .
wish i had never gone .
i will never visit this place again .
the whole experience was ruined .
there is no place to put your purse .
no way am i coming back here .
they nickel and dime you .
extremely mushy and not edible .
truly a weird place .
it was cheap at least .
worst customer service ever !
will not use this store again !
food was at best average .
so during the winter i would avoid this place .
did n't spend enough money ?
but , $ _num_ , for what ?
waitress should have probably mentioned that .
have you no home training ?
no more 1/2 glasses of wine .
i never received silverware or a napkin .
there is n't much to choose from .
the servers are n't exactly the best .
overall my experience here was not the best .
seated immediately which was great !
it goes downhill from there .
what a terrible experience .
we walked in and the place was jumping .
thanks for trying to kill our evening ms sunshine !
this was n't good .
just do n't come to this one .
the fries were disappointing .
$ _num_ for a french dip sandwich is crazy !
the cheapest glass of wine was $ _num_ .
my overall experience in your restaurant was one star .
this does n't even deserve any further discussion .
the filet in my salad was also very salty .
all in all , not worth the price .
wo n't be back .
i left hungry and very cranky .
houston , we have a problem .
they serve soda from a bottle which is ridiculous !
this was really strange to me .
bottom line this is not my scene .
the food does not justify the price .
the cheese bread , the chicken tenders appetizer .
water glasses were more empty than full .
hamburger , pork chop , kale salad and ribs .
have had better for much , much less money .
$ _num_ on the bill .
a changed experience - but not for the better !
the steak tasted like beef charcoal .
they did nothing to make up for it .
slow to bus tables .
slow on the water refills .
everything is wrong here now .
the grilled artichoke was on point , though .
our waitress seemed disinterested and barely checked on us .
tonight it was different .
the list goes on ... .
it was a complete dining disaster .
the taste in my mouth was awful .
i could not eat raw fish .
no other complaints except for the `` music '' .
it was my favorite restaurant .
today was a disaster .
i feel like i walked into a different restaurant .
not sure i am coming back .
_num_ and 1/2 hour wait on a tuesday !
my main complaint is this is arizona , folks !
it is _num_ degrees in february today .
wo n't be back until this policy changes .
she never returned to us outside .
we left and i will never return again .
expensive and bad service .
kids meal not printed .
this was the worst place ever .
are you kidding me ?
no , just those .
we 'll not be back .
obviously they do n't value their own merchandise .
poor training , poor customer service , disappointed .
wo n't go back to this location .
if i could give zero , i would .
do n't take up too much time .
i will admit , it 's cheap .
i will never step foot inside this place again .
just remember that it 's a cash only joint !
remember , small town feel , big city ?
i know , horrible !
not impressed in the least .
i wish i would have gotten a hamburger instead .
( oh hell no ! )
this is not the case .
worst thing was that they are cash only .
it was n't layered slices of corned beef .
the service was _num_ stars .
the egg salad sandwich was ok.
the atm states there is a $ _num_ fee .
feeling totally ripped off .
bad environment , worse food .
canned , mushy vegetables .
not a fresh ingredient to be found anywhere .
food and service were mediocre at best .
would rather go to breakfast club .
i will not do this again .
consider this your warning ! ''
randy was red in the face and extremely angry .
the problem i had was with lunch items .
worst customer service experience ever .
cancelled my order , wo n't be back .
the place was falling apart .
the room was clean and the tv worked .
noisy a/c unit below the window .
long wait to check in .
i made a reservation here about a week ago .
( it was empty remember ?
it 's a motel _num_ .
this place is a dump !
horrible horrible horrible customer service !
left after one night for another marriott property .
when i got home the work was n't done .
i would stay really far away from here .
just a poor experience all the way around .
unfortunately , i had the worst massage ever .
removing very dark mud .
unacceptable treatment with forced opinions onto the bride .
the building is very old and run down .
i would not go back .
you could n't even hear the music !
i was extremely disappointed .
there was no hot water !
the other $ _num_ was for yoga classes .
services are extremely overpriced .
facilities are outdated and in need of renovations .
spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere !
not on a table !
i was about to reschedule when i was found .
worst nail job i 've had in my life .
the actual nail not just the polish .
um ... why would i want to do that ?
all in all -- -i 'm not going back .
worst gel manicure i have ever had .
she destroyed my nails when taking the polish off .
bad service + bad results = bad review .
the place itself is very dirty .
i 've never had a worse acrylic job .
she still did n't speak english .
to a client that just walked in the door .
they looked like a _num_ year old polished them .
this place can not be sanitary .
it was not a pleasant experience at all .
why the snobby attitude ?
quite frankly , i felt embarrassed for her .
the place is dirty , messy .
and they charge more than any other place .
you will be disappointed .
and _num_ minutes was the promise time .
this place is terrible with deliveries .
carry out - do n't do delivery !
bad experience i wo n't be back .
but man are those walls thin .
each time it got worse .
there were no toiletries .
so why _num_ stars ?
ah , because it 's been consistently below average .
another issue i have had is the pool .
my last trip was below average .
even the landscaping was lame .
the desk was very apologetic .
i will not stay here again .
we stayed there for a week in october .
the reception staff is slow and not especially friendly .
the rooms are drab .
fortunately i did not have anything stolen .
i had prepaid for late check out on arrival .
she did n't even greet me .
terrible staff , terrible location and terrible rooms .
the service is abysmal .
parking is a nightmare .
had a difficult experience .
they would n't do anything about it .
the staff was very unhelpful altogether .
he never showed , never called .
so ... that 's pretty rude and disorganized .
my room was in rough shape .
first , this is not a resort .
the room has a terrible smell ( mildew ) .
stayed in the presidential suite .
boy was i wrong .
you guessed it - wrong again .
it took _num_ minutes to get _num_ dirty glasses .
they said they had n't received it .
no apologies were given .
wo n't be coming back .
there 's no coming back from this .
i did n't get a call .
wasted about _num_ hours with drive time .
i was so thankful for their care .
can i give zero stars ?
a disappointing waste of time .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
sorry to kill the buzz of these rave reviews .
this one has very poor customer service .
oh my this location is horrible .
there are hardly any toys in stock .
they all look overworked and miserable .
the once fresh coffee is stale and cool .
i agree with some of the other reviews .
overall this resort is a disappointment .
i 'm trying really hard not to be harsh .
this place is horrid for sleeping .
front desk on check in was nothing special .
simply unacceptable on any level .
which is a shame .
but it was not .
it 's pretty outdated .
the walls are very thin .
the tv was an old tube style tv !
the price was expensive and the hotel was cheap .
nothing special about this scottsdale road property .
hotel was a virtually empty .
hotel is old , old , old .
television set was ancient and terrible .
lock on the room door was broken .
bed was worn out .
brand new flat screen was recently installed .
pool area very plain .
would not stay there again .
i am so disappointed in this hilton .
no one offered help .
def not a _num_ star hotel .
a/c broken , had to request a box fan .
this place is bizarre .
wish it could be _num_ 1/2 stars .
* super thin walls .
this is a deal breaker for me .
* all the tv channels did n't work .
overall , lots of things seem slightly dated .
the service were very helpful .
needless to say i was very unhappy .
this is so unacceptable !
he refunded me that part , sort things right .
we have stayed here before .
but then things really started going down hill .
lastly , the restaurant service is slow .
i would try another hotel next time .
i really expected more , given the area .
i booked a _num_ king room .
the tv did not work .
there was no shampoo but two bottles of conditioner .
hilton , come on , you can do better .
this does n't happen anywhere else in the world .
the rooms are large but nothing special .
i would not stay here again .
the property was just very ok .
the service in the restaurant was very mediocre .
there was mold in the steam room .
the resort was just not what i expected .
the do n't even carry truffle oil !
- the produce is pretty terrible .
the layout of the store is weird to me .
what a waste of time !
the worst customer service !
it was so rude .
celebrity cleaners refused to respond to bbb letters .
most unremarkable below average place i could imagine .
but tonight 's service experience changed all that .
there is essentially one server waiting on approx .
_num_ tables with c. _num_ persons per table .
worst meal in arizona .
came here around 6pm and it was dead .
this was highly disappointing .
he said he could not do that .
this place is gross !
could n't wait to leave !
a very disappointing stay all in all .
we will not be back !
outdated rooms , breakfast was a horror .
this hotel is _num_ years old .
walked into our room and it smelled like smoke .
worst night sleep on our trip to az .
we spent one night and cancelled the rest .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
and there was zero parking .
i advised their would not be a next time .
ac in room does not work ( _num_ ) .
it is a disaster .
this is no go .
they lost my business .
this hotel is awful .
the bathroom offered little privacy .
i would never stay here again .
overall it was a negative experience .
front desk was clearly a temporary place .
will i choose another embassy suites ?
so far this was a big mistake .
tried _num_ machines last night and let maintenance know .
the waitress totally screwed up my order .
horrible service and greasy food .
bread on sandwich stale .
extremely long wait for food and not prepared right .
greasy food in a neat atmosphere .

no one even acknowledged us .
wo n't be back .
cheaper options and less flavorful foods .
but i want this _num_ star back !
food is awful , place filled with flies .
one of the worst restaurants in scottsdale .
the turkey was processed , not cooked today .
first , the seating is not very comfortable .
the scrambled eggs were okay but not served hot .
the sausage was tasteless .
she said the nugget was cold .
i could n't believe it .
but i will not be back after last time .
i will not go back there !
when he finished i could n't believe it .
maybe mark was having a bad day .
as for me , i 'm through .
the staff is rude .
thanks , but no thanks .
oh my gosh , this place is horrible .
one time she yelled at me for no reason .
she literally called me a big fat jerk .
i 'm dead serious .
she was n't even wearing any shorts .
these , however , are not normal circumstances .
i get it ... things get shopped .
i am so disappointed !
wo n't return to this location .
this is a very picked over ross .
shelves empty mid week with no one in store .
waste of time , energy and money .
never , ever , ever again .
as business owners , you should know that .
so , no more $ _num_ chef salads .
no more $ _num_ croissants .
are you kidding me ?
i would n't spend a nickel here .
but , that did n't happen to me.
my mocha was gritty and disgusting .
this is customer torture .
never ever going back .
the service is outrageously bad .
if i could give a zero rating i would .
thank god they opened a lowe 's by me .
difficult to find help in any department .
needless to say , we left .
i did n't find it funny at all .
well , they do n't seem to care .
thanks home depot for nothing !
lousy lousy lousy service .
so sad to see such bad service .
home depot never again !
worst home depot i 've ever been to .
this experience has absolutely ruined home depot for us .
over _num_ min later no one showed up .
major frustration dealing with the kitchen department !
this place still stinks for help .
there was a lighting guy literally _num_ feet away .
horrible customer service all the way around .
just had the worst experience at this station .
prices are often way too high !
i waited -- no show , no call .
no call back after about an hour .
their gas is way overpriced , too .
he said that would be _num_ cents more .
his tone and attitude was horrible .
maybe she had a bad day .
even the other manager agreed she is terrible .
that was around noon on dec 30th .
not once not twice 4/5 times ?
paid for the same propane over and over ?
very unprofessional and we do not recommend .
i i could post the entire email i would .
disappointed with honesty and they overcharge some .
it makes no sense to pay so much .
two of the three were terrible .
i really think that is way overpriced .
nothing is custom made .
i will not go back .
the salads and rice pudding looked disgusting .
not a good place to go for fresh food .
disgusting , disgusting , disgusting !
my date insisted i post his review .
the wrapping was poor at best .
the actual theater was even worse .
nothing special about the theater itself .
i was really disappointed and embarrassed for my client .
place is worn , and tired .
like staying at a days inn or similar .
upgrade to seasoned fries for an additional charge . ''
served with a side of balsamic vinaigrette .
there was no tomato on the burger .
i wo n't be back to this restaurant .
ran into a rude host .
the eggs benedict were mushy .
not even flip flops !
i mean the worst !
coffee was terrible , typical truck stop stuff .
service is average , food is n't good .
but bonus for outdoor seating .
i thought the good egg was mediocre .
waited _num_ minutes for a table .
she had not been told anything .
i will avoid in the future .
it was not what i anticipated but ok .
over _num_ dollars for two adults .
oh , i know , matt 's big breakfast !
unfortunately , they suck .
the thing is ... it 's not even cheap .
both times i was really disappointed .
first of all the eggs were not poached .
someone was n't watching the pot !
is n't steak and eggs on the mt .
when i am disappointed every single time .
raw onions with breakfast ?
not the way i want to start the day !
my biggest complaint , is the lack of cheese .
no trying to spread cold butter on hot toast !
when we arrived , we chose to sit outside .
never even opened the menus .
then , it gets worse .
3x for eggs benedict and still wrong .
we turned and walked out .
her hot chocolate tasted like swiss miss with water .
instead stands by the register talking to other servers .
it was n't the first time either .
why did they remove the egg paintings !
i have not been able eat here since _num_ .
just realized they have changed management or something .
but the food was no bueno !
no real stores of interest .
i really do n't get this place .
bottom line , do n't go here .
but that 's no reason to go there again .
dressings were thin and not very tasty .
better salads and better prices .
this restaurant is not run well .
again with the rude service at the cashier stand .
common sense and general friendliness would have been nice .
let there be zero flavor ! ''
poor quality food even for a buffet style .
i requested a wash , trim , and blowout .
came out with the worst haircut of my life .
the worst service ever .
sucks is the word .
hall of frames stinks .
so yelp has removed it twice .
this event cost them a long time customer .
with these guys , their errors are your fault .
plus no beer on tap kind of stinks .
least knowledgeable bartender i 've ever encountered .
for $ _num_ a seat this is not acceptable .
the high prices are however another outrageous factor .
i 'm not going to this safeway again .
my bill was only $ _num_ .
so , reluctantly i did exactly that .
you guys apparently do n't take it .
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
this is extremely unprofessional and is an inconvenience .
set your standards low so you 're not disappointed .
do n't make the mistake we did !
i was _num_ years old at the time .
worst pizza i every had !
and she did n't care .
how rude is that ?
talk about horrible customer service .
their pizza was horrible and drenched in grease .
i would take peter piper pizza over this crap .
i threw the salad away and left .
in scottsdale arizona this morning .
it does n't end there .
framing manager : `` we never cut artwork here .
this also continued for a few more rounds .
three days and $ _num_ .
it is obvious that they are paid on commission .
she tried to rush us through the sale .
i have never been so annoyed .
these people are so greedy .
do not let these people force you to buy !
they absolutely have no customer service .
do n't give this company your money .
th sales pressure by the staff is too much .
unfortunately the furniture did not perform as promised .
so standing i remained with _num_ bags if groceries .
personally i find this bar cheesy .
no problem with that .
the human race has jumped the shark .
are they really that offended by toes ?
it has continually gotten worse over the last year .
the dj is terrible , the crowd has changed .
i understand they recently lost their food license .
will not be back , esp .
what i really do n't understand is the dj .
it was not classy .
the drinks are weak .
devil 's north is worthless .
the patrons here are laughable .
no one was on the dance floor .
the all white decor was a little much .
a wan na be vegas or miami look .
i hate stores like this !
_num_ ) we bought _num_ items .
are you kidding me ?
not impressed on first contact .
no stars for this establishment .
, so they actually cost _num_ bucks a pop .
worst dry cleaners i have ever been to !
seven days and no one called back including owner .
your literally paying _num_ % more for no reason .
if i could rate them zero stars i would .
the associate then left and got the owner .
doctors are good but office staff is very lacking .
omg does n't the patient 's comfort come first ?
i just want an appointment .
oh , and she never called me back .
i will not be back .
both doctors were arrogant and impersonal .
worst medical practice ever .
office staff is rude and inattentive .
the asian girl has never been a nice person .
not a typing error .
instead it 's been a very negative experience .
i hate dealing with the shane company kids .
send me my money back !
walked around for a while .
i will not return to shane co .
i was a little insulted honestly and was done .
maybe thats why i have such an issue .
what kind of crap is that ?
is n't that false advertising ?
i was n't impressed with shane co at all .
when i say _num_ , i mean zero .
did n't seem to care .
do not rent a room here .
the furniture in the lobby is disgusting and dirty .
i am embarrassed that this hotel is in scottsdale .
this is not one of those hotels .
i went for the first time friday after work .
i 'm not setting foot in that spot again .
shame on north scottsdale family medicine !
we are not hard on furniture .
it 's for sitting on and watching tv .
the delivery charges did n't justify the expense .
these people are incompetent .
these people are clueless .
i would never use this company again .
i did not receive one call back .
it was inedible , we sent it back .
i really expected soooo much more from this place .
wow , i was disappointed .
they totally changed out the menu selection .
tgi friday have more selection then them .
plus the service was slow .
the whole restaurant seems to be empty .
they 're not all bad .
now the worst part .
i 'm not buying it .
loaded nachos are not good .
cheap beef and cheap processed cheese sauce .
bad service and worse food .
everything is way over priced and disgusting .
any major damage though , they did pay for .
they never get back to me .
we ultimately chose california pools because of their salesman .
california pools was a bust .
this customer service sucks .
she did not return my call after _num_ days .
again no return phone call .
very disappointed in these guys service .
they left a mud stream in the street curb .
very poor form , california pools & landscape .

_num_ weeks went by and we heard nothing .
she said she would have someone call us .
going on _num_ weeks for a basic play pool ?
i 'm still waiting for that call back .
our designer , dj , was the first issue .
better communication from there but still not to par .
we were scheduled to complete march _num_ .
they finished july _num_ .
disgusting place , poor attitudes , parking the worse !
warning do not go to this location .
overall , i 'd say it was decent .
not great , not good , but not terrible .
the rice looked like char !
the egg rolls were extremely doughy and bland .
such thick dough i did n't finish even one .
could n't put enough sauces to add flavor .
it was a bland taste of who knows what .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
the chicken wings were inedible .
the fried rice was even worse .
this time it was awful .
the chicken was dry .
the fried rice had no flavor .
you need to take chance in this restaurant .
second time , just ok .
third time , awful .
all were okay but nothing really stood out .
i ordered kung pao beef and vegetable chow mein .
felt like something was missing in the flavor .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
hoping it would be good , it was disgusting !
it was all lacking in flavor for us .
the customer service is awful .
they did not return my calls .
would n't accommodate my schedule .
they seemed entirely overwhelmed by our large group .
not my idea of a resort .
it was almost laughable .
by far the worst i have ever attended .
the food was awful !
beef jerky instead of roast beef au jus .
the vegetables were undercooked and hard .
what a total mess of a resort .
very loud and disturbing !
place is very run down .
no activities at resort .

it is a total hole .
no room service no spa .
do n't waste time or money here .

the property is depressing .
it was just dull and depressing .
i do not know why we come back here .
this place is a joke and poorly managed .
there was not a soul in site .
the course is in terrible shape .
not a good value at all .
i would not recommend .
front desk and outside staff were friendly .
guess what , that 's an additional $ _num_ .
the nails are uneven and shaped horribly .
do not go to this salon !
they have lost a customer .
the employees here are so rude .
it was pretty bland .
want to eat a lot of so-so sushi ?
not me , i 'm trying elsewhere .
-- bland , gooey , overcooked , or undercooked .
dh & i went to benihana on friday night .
the service was also bad .
would not go back .
wo n't go back .
did n't even make it past the hostess nazi .
-- _num_ empty tables filled with dirty dishes !
he was sarcastic and condescending during the entire preparation .
we go often and this time was the worst .
but that is not written on the coupon .
the waitress was so rude !
no thank you ... left .
asks for our drink order ; just waters .
_num_ min later , we get them .

yuk ; save your money and go elsewhere !
the food was okay , but the timing sucked !
horrible experience at this place .
this place is not for foodies .
horrible , slow service .
the birthday certificate used to be way better .

if i could rate a _num_ i would .
the sushi rolls were bland and flavorless .
i was super disappointed .
i 'll never go back to this benihana again .
no apology & not accurate .
i 've enjoyed other locations but this was pathetic .
unfortunately this will be my last visit to benihana .
at _num_ minutes we got up and walked out .
i recently dined at benihana for my birthday celebration .
this is my second attempt here .
what a shame , benihana !
hostess was very rude and unwelcoming .
this visit was not like the others .
gave less food than before .
just not an entire spice rack full .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
also ordered the spinach cakes from the app menu .
had a bad lunch .
the soup was too thick and salty .
the chicken kabob was tough .
i saw a cook i never seen before .
ill take a break for awhile .
this is how people get sick .
just not very appetizing .
the food was dripping in grease .
should be called the bad egg .
the cook obviously did n't try my potatoes .
the bad egg is a joke .
cesar g said the food is plain , bland .
the buttermilk pancakes are also a fail .
how long does it really take to cook eggs ?
needless to say their service was very slow .
this is about _num_ steps up from ihop .
there was nothing good about my experience .
my one star rating is more then they deserve !
they cut portions way down and kept prices up .
when the food came it was cold .
not going to this chain ever again !
also , everything was cold .
very disappointed by this company .
still waiting _num_ months later for custom pillows .
no follow up during the process .
tiffany prices with dollar store execution .
would not work with them again .
the condition of the furniture was completely unacceptable .
it was like a dressed up gas station bathroom .
i was really excited to try this place today .
sadly , the food blows .
i 'm gon na fix that rat .
none of us ate more than 1/2 our bowls .
when we stepped in , i was excited .
it looked like our kinda place .
all in all , no one was nice here .
disgusting ... ... ... .
it was not authentic and very americanized chinese .
overall , the experience was highly disappointing .
just not a fan of chop and wok .
_num_ bites was _num_ too many .
the worst excuse for chinese food !
worse than kmart photography !
the _num_ star is for service .
the employee seemed to be a bit annoyed .
and it was n't just me who thought this .
but alas , no love was shown .
anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine .
i ca n't stand that .
anyway , its ok .
check it out and decide for yourself .
the service also has gone downhill .
our sushi was less than stellar .
it tasted frozen , chewy , and often stale .
the katsu chicken was dry and hard .
we will not return to sushi on shea .
the food quality was awful !
i am a crazy sushi lover !
the food quality was awful !
the food was just nothing to write home about .
first of all the staff is extremely rude .
not a big sushi fan but my wife is .
but the scallop roll was undercooked and tasted bad .
i was super disappointed with sushi on shea .
total came to $ _num_ ... that seemed crazy ?
the sushi was ok , the service was ok .
wo n't be going back .
the quality of the fish was not that great .
gave me seared yellowtail with rice .
ordered spicy tuna , zero spicy .
no jalapeo , and it was quite mushy .
they need better lighting .
talk is cheap , watch out for empty promises .
extremely overpriced for the end product .
they did my landscape plan around _num_ years ago .
sunday came and went , no flowers .
my cell phone had n't rang all day .
are you kidding me ?
i know i never will again .
are they just not into tires ?
i did not use medical insurance at costco .
would not recommend `` doctor my eyes . ''
all she wants to do is make money .
no sign , no explanation .
my leather did not last at all .
they gave me free samples which burned my skin .
too many other good nail places around .
i think this pie is awful .
it 's quite pricy too .
not bad , but not good , either .
what really ruined it for me was the cheese .
this was just so not worth it .
the pizza was tasteless , overpriced and burnt .
delivery guy showed no care for the pizza .
i did not complain i just called to ask .
do not get delivery .
the owner is unprofessional and blatantly rude .
they were very skimpy on the ingredients .
no credit towards another class .
not even a discount towards another class .
i took a pie baking class right before christmas .
i was not asking for a free class .
no reply at all .
this is completely unacceptable !
the rude lady basically hung up on me .
i would not recommend this store to anyone .
short or they wo n't see you .
there is no empathy .
they are n't very cheap either .
too bad the dining experience ruined the night .
i 'm very torn about this place .
scallops - _num_ , not recommended !
the executive chef should know better !
i 've had much better .
unfortunately it all went downhill from there .
setting is cute , food is mediocre .
i ordered the scallops over chorizo risotto .
he was `` rushed '' through the whole meal .
our bill came out to _num_ .
this meal was not worth that price .
bread is also not automatically brought to the table .
very inconsistent food quality .
i 'm not making this up .
however , our server was terrible .
not cooked to our liking .
i thought it was rude !
do n't eat here !
no prompt refills on iced tea .
worst sandwich i 've ever had !
will not be returning .
our waiter was cordial but inattentive .
i could not believe it !
needless to say , i will never go back !
awful customer service , will not be returning .
the food is nothing great .
i can not believe the reviews on yelp .
now for the bad part .
it was fresh but nothing to write home about .
the duck leg confit was abysmal .
after today i wo n't be going back .
it was barely warm and the cheese was hard .
the service was just ok.
i guess zinc is taking the french thing literally .
visited on september 6th and wo n't be back .
got denied by a rude manager ( ?
went back in august ( for birthday dinner ) .
almost empty restaurant but service was terrible .
_num_ % french _num_ % ?
_num_ mins to get entree after finishing soup .
really need better wait staff .
desserts or something to make up for the delay .
but she has no power to do anything .
does not deserve another chance .
just got done with lunch and service was horrible .
we were horrified because they smelled so bad !
pass this one by .
$ _num_ for a small draft .
this chef has lost his way .
are no french staples except for the fries .
really ... scallops and coleslaw ?
tasteless scallops to boot .
doubt the tomato sauce was homemade .
it 's just too pricey .
was not expecting that .
had a sad experience there this past weekend .
i ca n't recommend the cheesecake factory .
and what a disappointment it was .
and of course , offered nothing for the trouble .
well not once were we asked .
lets just say the service was beyond awful .
they served me a salad that has gone bad .
but got bad salmon on sat .
will avoid the salmon at all cost .
i felt horrible for the other group .
our waiter was just kinda sloppy .
he did n't even know what time it was .
this was really bad .
the quality here has hit a low .
we could n't wait to get out if there .
did n't even go for dessert .
extremely disappointed in our experience at the cheesecake factory .
the only cheesecake which was good was the original .
the problem was the server .
we ate here today for lunch .
had empty glasses for approx .
not at all what we expected for the price .
beware of getting sick here !
_num_ stars only because the food was good .
she was nowhere to be found .
the service is really bad .
does n't anyone know how to fry anymore ?
i did n't complain .
but i did not complain .
not good , cheesecake factory , not good .
no offer to fix it at that point .
terrible tone of voice and everything .
not the cleanest cheesecake factory i 've visited .
_num_ minute wait for our meal today at lunch .
im giving this _num_ stars .
she said no one had brought it out .
the burger came plain with no onion rings .
place was loud and chaotic .
oh and not to mention absolutely disgusting .
we waited _num_ minutes after being told _num_ .
silverware covered in old crusted food .
these strawberries should have never been served !
but i could n't see it or taste it .
what happens next was down right disgusting .
very grossed out and disappointed .
the quality of food has gone down the drain .
i waited _num_ min no one came out .
shame on you cheesecake factory !
i ordered a mexican tortilla salad with chicken .
way too costly for the type of salad .
then they was another dog running around the bar .
once is a mistake .
three times is inexcusable .
$ _num_ for one jacket and one dress .
i did n't finish the sandwich .
not a place to go if you like wraps .
the cheese at least tasted like real cheddar cheese .
that 's not good for business !
i do n't understand why it 's such .
but it 's not worth the stress and hassle .
einstein , i hate you bad .
i do n't want _num_ of them .
my experience this time was worse .
_num_ other customers also with no food .
i do n't want _num_ of them .
this place is the worst !
they always seem annoyed to make your food .
they gave me a coupon for a free sandwich .
i just really wish they would make a change .
i 'm never going back .
most apathetic , borderline rude staff .
then she put the phone down .
and she was not the receptionist .
same marks going down his legs .
seems ridiculous for the minor work performed .
get your quote in writing !
they seriously lack customer service .
that 's why i called tuesday morning !
but should i really have to argue for that ?
but it 's not worth it !
lincoln properties are the worst in scottsdale .
bad management and high rent for junk .
plus he treats his help like crap .
it was ok ... nothing special .
i should have just gone to jimmy johns .
just another typically italian deli with italian attitude .
let 's cut to the chase .
this place would n't make it through opening weekend .
it 's pretty hard to mess up eggs .
the chicken parmesan sandwich i bought was awful .
it is also very expensive .
please , save yourself money and time .
umm ... not so much .
chicken noodle soup was very salty !
so , reluctantly , i did .
rude service mediocre food and slow delivery times .
why mess up a good thing ?
i am just horrified at this customer service .
really bad sandwiches in this dump .
not good for the money .
no sir i would not like another .
it 's too bad .
he did n't care at all .
obviously he does not appreciate his customers .
worst sausage and peppers sandwich ever .
i would not waste my money or time .
wo n't be back .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
girl on the phone was very rude .
i am never going to order there again .
huge difference and big mistake .
do n't waste your money like i did .
okay never coming here again .
do not come to this location they suck .
eh ... its an ok place to go .

room was okay but clearly worn .
suffice to say nothing came of this .
_num_ ) always book through the hotel .
also , a clogged shower drain .
dark and attendant was creepy .
dirty , dirty , dirty .
i 'd rather pay to sleep in my car .
also , the staff is very rude .
stained carpet , just plain flat dirty !
if i could give it no stars i would .
it was like hitting rock bottom .
it was like hitting rock bottom .
horrible experience for my daughter 's wedding .
do not go here for a suit .
i will not walk back in here .
i go in wednesday and everything went wrong .
then the pants were too long still .
they are either incompetent or straight up liars .
the employees were friendly , overall , as well .
i really want to like this place .
the food however , leaves much to be desired .
same goes for his customers .
this is where my happiness ends .
the staff were completely apathetic to all of this .
it needs an attitude and staff adjustment .
i just had the worst chi tea latte ever .
it did n't taste anything like chi .
had a very disappointing breakfast .
but the worst was the service .
the service was awful .
i much prefer starbucks to an attitude like this .

the lack of stars is the service .
salon earns a minus _num_ the worst ever !

another one bites the dust .
return factor - an obvious _num_ % .
odd menu , poor choices , poorly presented .
i will not go back .
this is not good asian food .
the veggie stir fry was terrible .
the quality of food just was n't that good .
the food was as lackluster as the service .
not very pleased 2nd time around wo n't return .

not impressed with this restaurant at all .
and complete lack of service .
is what you are looking for .
no flavors stood out at all .
poor food , poor service .
that 's not chinese food !
i find it offensive to be frank .
the entrees , however made up for it .
all in all , not the best experience .
i am so disappointed .
the crab puffs were the most disappointing .
so little crab , so much cream cheese .
however , tonight we had to walk out .
it tasted okay , nothing special though .
the last _num_ times , very disappointing .

slow service , slow food and cold chicken .
the service was the worst .
this place drives me crazy .
i went alone tonight .
did n't see my waiter .
the calamari is tasty but often too chewy .
i ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp .
apparently that means serve it plain , no sauce .
they were definitely not very accomodating .
there was also no free wifi .
yes , the hotel reeks of smokers .
the help at the restaurants are beyond clueless .
- walls between rooms are very thin .
- room # _num_ has bed bugs !
with little to no personal space and is dirty .
came here for thanksgiving dinner and it was terrible .
the food was cold and over salted .
the prime rib was over cooked and very salted .
however , the service is extremely inconsistent .

maybe i should not have trusted the westin .
i stayed here late march .
the service , sadly , was terrible !
the kids pool and surrounding grounds were filthy !
our room got cleaned once in _num_ days .

their own employees do not even know their policies .
i gave him my number .
sadly to say , we will not return .
day _num_ , my key card would n't work .
they took my number and never called back .
no compensation at all .
but unfortunately run by incompetent front desk staff .
even the bell guy said they were very rude .
some weird , offensive smell throughout entire hotel .
golf prices , just too high .
only _num_ room was ready .
from there it all goes downhill !
it is a no go !

the pieces are too hot to use .
there was no service at all .
we were so disappointed !

not even kidding this really happened .
again , _num_ hours for double beds ?
umm , that 's gross .
to me , that 's money better spent .
not a rack i will frequent .
none of this is true .
turns out you get coupons that are like cash .
all the poor reviews on yelp are spot on .
did i mention this was is a shoe store ?

they have a couple of generic draft beers .
the execution was totally off .
the food was mediocre .
this is a big loss for the community .
awful service leads to never trusting this place .
overall bad taste in how they handle things .
i went back _num_ days later unfortunately .
what a complete disaster !
literally the worst shopping experience i 've ever had .
it was rude and intrusive .
online is wrong , store is correct .
yup , `` _num_ includes delivery '' ?
nope , they could not handle that either .
the ball actually rolls where it should go .
boy was i wrong !
i will never step foot into another ymca again .
_num_ % discount for a family in need ?
paying upper management with it ?
workout room is very crowded with equipment .
no way , no how .
other gyms which charge less have clean machines .
valet parking at this store , really ?
yeah , me neither .
not even a hello .
i walked in and looked at all the furniture .
not a smile , not a hello , nothing .
what a crappy brand experience .
typical for scottsdale however .
scary store totally void of color .
depressing and dank furniture .
and calling customer service was a joke .
just do n't bother a busy sales person .
do n't like this place very much .
it just was n't great .
again , nothing was wrong with it .
however , it was far from gourmet .
but for that price , i expect quality .
i have nothing against this restaurant .
so i 'll be taking my money to those .
if it was homemade pasta , i would understand .
the filling and sauce were terrible .
overall , it was a disappointing meal .
flavorful , yes , but not spicy as described .
the homemade ravioli were large and flavorful , though .
i ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms .
did not enjoy my meal at all .
could not get myself to eat it .
the main courses were completely forgettable .
portions were small and way overpriced .
unfortunately we were very disappointed .
surprisingly nothing came with the food .

our whole experience was terrible .
she never said they were sorry .

it was disappointing and we will never return .
the hostess is rude and condescending .

the service was awful and slow .

this place is way over rated !
she ruined our evening .
made suggestions and was prompt with drinks .
none of the apps are gf .
i ordered a very boring salad .
why have reservations if you do not honor them ?
and $ _num_ dollars lighter .
it was disgusting and certainly gross .
they surely threw her under the bus .
our waitress was pushy and a bit rude .
i could n't believe it .
i said no and proceeded to leave .
they seem to just want your money .
all my favorite staff is gone too .
do n't take your animals to banfield hospitals .
i never received updated warranty cards .
something is just not adding up .
at pick up it was $ _num_ !
would not recommend to anyone !
however ... my thank you was a bitter one .
last time i 'll be visiting them sadly .
these guys are horrible .
i was drinking water .
i was not informed of this and was pissed .
these specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy .
i 'm not going back to this place .
just left the arena sorts grill .
however , that it where it stops .
never again would we go to this place .
that 's not a chicken wing .
it sure did n't look like 1/3 lb either .
i would not go back here .
it is definitely a cheap sports bar .
a complete waste of money .
unfortunately , a lot has changed .
it was like rubber and very dry .
hard to cut with a fork .
everything was completely flavorless .
everyone in our party was disappointed with their meals .
it was n't anything close to decent .
sadly i will never go back .
this place used to be a favorite of mine .
idk what happened but it really went down hill .
i probably wo n't be back for the food .
soggy and over cooked beef .
nothing on yelp says they are closed .
i could n't eat either of them .
it was ok , i guess .
i 'd highly suggest that you not eat here .
i was very disappointed .
again , no problem paying for the diet coke .
my low review is based on the owner .
probably wo n't go back either .
a warning would have been nice .
then the beer prices , really ?
umm not worth the drive at all .
my chicken was a little too done .
i hate this place .
could n't stand the music .
play to your audience not what you like .
i was really disappointed with our experience here .
the service was by far the worst .

it really felt like they cared for helping him .
we 've had _num_ dogs in ca .
you read right $ _num_ to torture our dog .
very bad customer service .
they too seemed surprised by cactus flower 's attitude .
really less than impressed .
thier driver must think they own the road .
very poor customer service !
they never sell old flowers just toss them .

repairs cost just shy of $ _num_ .
$ _num_ , really ?
talk about a rip-off !
i would never patronize the room store again .
they have the worst customer service department .
they try everything they can to void the warranty .
there wo n't be a third time .
i had a terrible experience with this place !
i wish i could give it negative stars .
they definitely do n't deserve _num_ star .
buyer beware , this place is terrible .
now for the horrible .
that 's when it got worse .
the worst part is n't even over .
i could n't believe my ears !
i will never purchase anything from this company again .
we originally ordered them a week before christmas .
almost _num_ months later .
this place is soooo _num_ .
it looked out of place to a humorous degree .
that 's two hundred and fifty dollars .
i felt so mad at this point .
okay i contacted james at this ups store .
he would n't work with my at all !
this place has no respect for regular customers .
greedy owners and no respect for regulars .
poor service mediocre food .
this place was utterly ridiculous .
i ordered pizza , wife ordered chicken parm .
we will not be back .
so nasty and so rude .
mediocre italian , at best .
the broasted potatoes were boring fried potatoes .
it was dry , dry dry .
the owner is rude .
he was loud and overbearing to customers .
it 's gone to hell .
false advertising at its best .
worst service i 've had in quite some time .
this place is a disaster !
the dirty cooks do n't wear gloves .
we waited another _num_ minutes and walked out .
i ordered linguini with clam sauce .
the clams were not fresh .
no beers on tap .
no cold glasses either .
we waited another _num_ minutes to order .
talk about the worst service , food and atmosphere .
they deserve to go out of business !
you really should n't have to wonder that .
never made it to my next appointment .
but i should n't have been surprised .
meets the craving for chicago but not completely .
shame on you guys .
these things were used but sold at full price .
i just will not go back .
i have never felt more uncomfortable going anywhere .
i wo n't be back here again .
people should know they are buying nearly stolen merchandise .
stay away and be warned !
why why would the owners use that location !
this place is overpriced and is n't real italian .
do n't waste your time here .
my husband just got chicken parmesan which so bland .
they did n't like the taste .
the shrimp was horribly cooked and rubbery .
just not good food !
the food was fresh but very bland .
i was disappointed overall and wo n't be back .
the bread was nothing special .
the water tasted terrible .
portion size was ridiculously small .
dust and trash everywhere and the stench was awful .
would like to see more additions here .
really really upset ... the waiter was horrible !
so , why the _num_ star review ?
waiter was rude rest of the night .
i so appreciate the service and the food .
which is completely ridiculous .
utterly disappointed in their customer service .
looks like we will try another local place instead .
what a horrible experience .
but i 'm having trouble .
are you kidding me ?
hmm no , but thanks .
you have been most helpful .
will never go back and do not recommend .
however , the service was terrible .
another quality restaurant bites the dust .
would not go back again .
at scottsdale , huge mistake !
the server and manager we encountered were rude .
the steaks were just ok .
but , she served it anyway .
the noise level was unbearable .
i went here for restaurant week .
mediocre is the best i can say .
not worth it for the price .
all i can is meh .
hands down it was awesome .
the filet looked like beef jerk or barbacoa .
just overall not impressed with the price and selection .
second rate food , and poor management !

unfortunately that location is closed now .
the service was extremely rushed and indifferent .
the lobster cocktail was not edible .
it was disappointing how crowded the tables were .
the steak was nothing special .
i was disappointed in the mac .
it also just tasted like bar food .
it was a huge disappointment .
that was over _num_ weeks ago .
the food was insulting for the price .
my steak was a very fatty and tough .
i probably wo n't be returning anytime soon .
_num_ ) we chose morton 's for restaurant week .
it was dry and not very tasty .
it 's not appropriate '' .
why does he keep calling him my friend ?
i corrected him _num_ separate times .
i will not return until adjustments are made .
obviously he did not care .
service and food was way below par .
also , our dinner orders were wrong .
i 'm trying to get our money back .
food was acceptable but service was lousy .
morton 's is not what it used to be .
steaks were great , service was terrible .
tonight begins arizona restaurant week .
very low ceilings very dark restaurant .
the waitstaff had an irritating air to them .
but everything else was average if not worse .
_num_ star prices for zero star quality food .
just not my scene .
only reason i would .
should you decide to dine at ra .
it was that blah sushi .
sucked as soon as we walked in .
why , why , why ?
thank god i 'm not _num_ .
turn the fucking music down !
teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright .
eh , this place is not good .
salad & soup mediocre .
i showed the manager , she walked away .
waiting for the replacement sushi without wasabi took forever .
no discount off the bill .
this place has the worst service and sushi food .
i would try to find another place .
this place sucks ass .
lost my business for good .
there was a delay even after that point .
_num_ minutes just to get waited on .
maybe she should have been trained in it better .
the vegas rolls were way too messy .
i had no clue what the other thing was .
anyway , it was overpriced .
$ _num_ for a well martini ?
bad experience on reservation .
instead , we have to wait _num_ hours .
this is where it gets confusing .
i remember there was _num_ hostesses .
management , train your employees on customer service .
too many fails for the least acceptable reason .
but not packed i.e .
i can take a rude _num_ year old .
the ladies room was disgusting .
not even worth it for happy hour .
not off to a good start ra .
but the server we then had was amazing !
the bathroom was disgusting .
this ra has the worst service of all !
the server did nothing .
it actually did not even taste good .
it was an all around mess .
the issue was the horrendous customer service .
no customer ever wants to feel rushed .
no rush sir . ''
i received dirty looks to boot ?
most recent trip here was disappointing .
drinks and service were slow .
i likely wo n't be coming back .
we we finally got our drinks they tasted horrible .
no telling what was taking place in the kitchen .
the food did n't make anything better .
the late night cravings were kicking in .
let 's just say waaaay too much cream cheese .
the food was mediocre at best .
scallop was too chewy .
rice was too sticky .
horrible horrible service by danielle .
the people around us could n't believe it .
it 's not that hard !
she is a rude person with a horrible attitude .
we will not return in your establishment .
there is zero reason to be treated that way !
maybe you need a big window in customer service .
they literally comp meals left and right .
they came out soo dry .
i mean like dry dry .
like it was beef and chicken crackers .
the food is awful .
but hey , the portions of it are huge !
went to get gel nails the other day .

the person who scheduled was not there .
no offer to accomodate .
customer service is awful .
this place is not clean !

i have very mixed feelings about this place .
am i crazy to walk back in here ?
nice place on the inside but horrible experience .
the absolute worst manicure i 've ever had .
very unprofessional and extremely poor customer service .
i will never go back to desert nail spa .
was very rushed and not even enjoyable .
the foot massage was maybe _num_ minutes .
my nails were uneven .
are we serious here ?
haircut : nothing special .
i wasted time and money at bravo .
worst experience of my life !
also , store is very dirty !
would never go back and do not recommend !
first off , the lighting stunk .
she just did n't have a soft touch .
overall , it was below average experience .
wait ... mediocre might be a stretch .
bravo appears to cater to primarily elderly clientele .
my stylist was over _num_ min late .
the place looks old and kind of cheap .
i wo n't be back to bravo salon .
i would not recommend this salon to a friend .
this guy has been rude to me several times .
terrible service and not professional at all .
disappointed and will have to get my tailoring elsewhere .
i hate writing negative reviews !
i gave him another try with a skirt .
i was desperate so i let it slide .
he quoted another $ _num_ !
anything else stay away .
i said forget it and walked away .
some of the worst service i 've ever seen .
the atmosphere not so much .
not above average , but good for average wings .
clock doctor ruined it .
it was huge , but a bit bland .
now i wish we could forget last night .
the seafood in the paella was dry .
i wo n't be dining here ever again .
food and service was a++ .
my only complaint was the seating and chairs .
they use plastic chairs -- like cheap lawn chairs .
it was just as i remembered .
blah and bland and pretty boring .
a cold bean dip with hot chips ?
havana cafe does n't even come close .
would n't go back .
needless to say i 'm very disappointed .
the atmosphere was tacky and unimpressive .
horrible experience , bland food , overpriced .
the atmosphere was not bad .
it made dinner very uncomfortable .
the cuisine is unique , but poorly prepared .
again , service was horrible .
food is overpriced and not that great .
* _num_ mins into eating .
_num_ mins has past , drink cups are empty .
wait my automatic watch stopped working .
the prices remain high .
i love their food but their service is horrible .
what happened tonight was the last straw .
as usual i went for mojito monday .
the sangria was n't anything special though .
the paella was really salty and buttery .
unfortunately the seafood inside was n't very fresh .
the steak was not a premium cut of meat .
we then got bread pudding and flan for dessert .
it was fairly bland and forgettable .
maybe i just do n't like cuban food though .
would not recommend this at all .
stay away from this garbage dump .
the service liked the food was garbage .
there were at least _num_ tables open .
our entrees were brought out to us .
for chicken , rice & beans .
was i ever disappointed .
this place has turned me off of cuban food .
the rice and beans were mediocre and flavorless .
way too expensive for low quality food .
i definitely do not plan on returning .
specially for a $ _num_ lunch .
all the dishes we ordered were disgusting !
i can go on forever but would rather not .
it cost me $ _num_ .
they were just barely good .
until then i would avoid this place .
there was n't even a waitress anywhere in sight .
this place is racist !
they did n't care .
what a huge disappointment !
the seafood clearly was n't fresh .
it was old seafood .
not impressed at all .
the total bill was around _num_ bucks .
food not that good overpriced .
service not that good .
this place was just eh .
the dessert , creme brulee , was awful !
i ca n't see them being open much longer .
place was nearly empty on a friday evening .
then a wait , and i mean a wait .
probably over _num_ minutes minimum .
not a hint of red .
looked like a meatball with spaghetti around it .
just an odd , outdated place .
scratch this one off the list .
but it was not even worth 1/2 price .
the bread was burned and dry .
desserts at $ _num_ was terrible .
the food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce .
the service is extremely slow .
the food was extremely subpar .
i could taste plenty of oil unfortunately .
the pasta was swimming in grease .
this place is expensive and not good .
i would suggest taking your hard earned cash elsewhere .
this has nothing to do with food or service .
the painting on the wall is absurd !
i could n't eat it after the third bite .
they really need to look to that .
i hate when they are soft and slimy .
last attempt was the butternut squash ravioli .
save your money try some where else .
the gel manicure did not even last _num_ days .
$ _num_ for a pedicure and fill !
the color was no longer there .
rude and not great with customer service .
i felt like the staff was lazy .
i wo n't be back .
wo n't be back .
messy , messy , messy .
the cream cheese did n't taste very fresh either .
ill give the bagels a try sometime .
veggies and bacon looked unappetizing .
prices are inflated ( scottsdale lol ) .
anyway , this place ai n't it .
there were _num_ strips of steak on my bread .
bagels were large , but nothing special .
avoid this place if you know bagels .
there are no lunch specials or combos .
the service at this place is horrible .
the staff is is incompetent & lazy .
they literally walked away without saying anything .
my order was wrong when i got it .
because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting .
this place is very disorganized .
something about this place feels dirty to me .
the omelet was very overcooked and dry .
worst service i 've ever encountered .
avoid like the plague .
tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye , not steamed .
the pastrami was served cold .
oh well i 'm sure the bagels are ok .
for my order , thankfully she put on gloves .
this place is terrible !
i am from new york .
food presentation was nothing with nothing .
spend _num_ for breakfast .
the bagels were just so-so .
our visit was in a word , sad .
and i really hate having to say that .
we were seated promptly , so no problems there .
a little common kindness goes a really long way .
not sure based on our experience .
the potatoes were ok but also not hot .
but apparently he did n't look at my plate .
our poor waiter was sweet but clueless .
ruth is off in her own little world .
this is not the first time .
we mentioned our concern to ruth the last time .
i do n't recommend this place .
the manager was rude .
i wish i could give no stars .
terrible customer service , even now .
needless to say , there were several other dogs .
the absolute worst management .
the paper towel roller is broke .
the worst customer service around .
their stock is not dependable .
8:30 on a saturday , give me a break .
not worth the wait .
just not worth the price they 're charging .
instead , i came away underwhelmed .
the ambience was less than ideal .
no candles on any of the tables .
in short , the presentation needed work .
however , the damage was already done .
lastly , they only accept cash .
i would not say that it is very inexpensive .
are you kidding me ?
nothing to stand up and shout over .
i am glad i did not get sick .
food however was a disappointment .
probably would n't come back .
extremely disgusting and rude !
did n't even take the sandwich off the bill .
also they only take cash here .
each slice was individually breaded and then baked .
i would n't recommend coming here .
felt forgotten on the patio .
$ _num_ for three .
i wish i could give it zero stars !
do n't quite get the reviews .
place is tiny and only takes cash .
major turn off / not a great 1st impression .
me not spending any more money here .
this was terribly inconvenient .
the crab is imitation .
plus cash only to pay really ?
i ordered eggplant parmigiana , which arrived only lukewarm .
could not even find the eggplant .
this time was terrible .
she hates side talk as well .
i did n't sign up to get yelled at .
the selection is lackluster with really no great finds .
bland , bland and more bland .
great in theory , poor in execution .
the problem began when he returned to our house .
they treated us very poorly .
my two star rating is mainly for the food .
very little on the menu is vegetarian .
there is nothing modern or innovative on the menu .
chips and salsa are my favorite here .
not worth the time or your money !
slow service and messed up orders .
burritos : chicken inside was excellent .
decor : old and needs a redo and cheesy .
workers : mostly teenagers with no management .
awful al 's as we call it .
same menu items from _num_ .
no wonder the place was dead .
so , so mexican food .
service was a little to hands off .
had n't been here in many years .
the service was awful .
the bartender could not maintain her tables .
she was clueless to her actions .
the food was mediocre .
pollo con queso was tasteless .
chicken had no flavor .
i appreciate that but it was too late .
bad service , bad food .
loyal customer no longer .
they also will not label any take out .
food was par for mexican cuisine and nothing special .
the facility is clean but it was so outdated .
my expectations were not met , very disappointed .
my son had a horrible experience there .
just a sad situation in general .
nope , no mistake .
however the staff is rude and unfriendly , extremely !
would not step foot in this place again .
that just blew me away !
horrible people and very rude office staff .
i will not come back here ever again .
will not go back !
so , thought i would give them another chance .
is as bad as the store itself .
guess what no phone call or email .
i can not recommend this place .
was it a horrible experience ... .
rooms were very small and breakfast was awful .
but the customer service was completely awful .
i do not want to deal with this again .
i called hays and they quoted me $ _num_ !
really , how do you guys have _num_ stars ?
called on monday to schedule for tune up .
he says sure , no problem .
compressor will reset . ''
for the record i have never complained on yelp .
this place is terrible .
worst school i 've been to in my life .
do n't waste your time here .
monty is the owner operator of the store .
i 'm never coming here again .
that 's not fair .
not a way to run a music store .
lack of customer service and out right rude staff .
now off to google a better place for lessons .
probably the worst haircut i 've ever had .
left and went straight to my usual barber .
just like everyone else .
$ _num_ for both ?
but why are you reading this ?
i am so totally grossed out by this location .
but the salad was all iceberg lettuce .
i have n't eaten here in about _num_ years .
many reasons which were confirmed tonight .
pizza was not so good .
did n't like the cheese .
their food tastes like cardboard .
i had the baked ziti which was flavorless .
party of _num_ , only _num_ were served .
service was less than average .
olive garden continues its slow down hill slide .

waited over _num_ minutes for entrees to be served .
terrible service , worse food .
no apologies , no nothing from her .
today was extremely disappointing .
i was highly offended !
your lack of service .
was put on hold for _num_ min + .
they were not even busy only half full .
some of the worst customer service .
i would not recommend take out from this location .
i literally have never been treated so horribly .
all olive gardens are a joke .
soup is basically oil .
the pasta is crap and nothing has taste .
the only problem is that nothing is updated .
i scheduled an appointment with the dr .
the pa came in for _num_ minutes .
he barely did a physical exam .
their priority is obviously not patient care .
i 'll miss brittany pa : ( .
too bad that their service is so poor .
the new owner & management is not customer focused .
i was not happy .
if i could give a lower score i would .
save yourself the trouble , shop elsewhere !
my girlfriend 's favorite restaurant is red lobster .
yea , i like their biscuits .
and the food is n't particularly bad or anything .
the restaurant is not designed to accommodated handicapped people .
never again , date night at red lobster .
food was pretty good , but service was bad .
but no such luck .
recently things have slipped .
what came was batter , no fish .
too may other places to eat .
the wait staff was just okay .
wait staff just matter of fact about it.
will not be returning .
i ca n't tell you how disappointed i was .
skip the fries though .
awful , service awful and food is gross .
seafood is not fresh at all .
cheddar biscuits are a round heart attack to come .

she said she would find out who it was .
it even looks like the wings are assorted sizes .

the sweet peppers were not sweet , just bitter .
there is nothing wrong with going to uncle sams .

i called nick as steve was off that day .
a major inconvenience for everyone .
this place is ridiculous !
shame on you macaroni grill !

appetizers muscles were good as was the soup .
i originally assumed i had somebody else 's order .
except the pasta was undercooked .
i do not intend to go back .
the food came out cold and nasty .
the highlight of the meal was the bread .
from there , it was all downhill .
got all of the orders wrong in some way .
did n't refill drinks .
it 's a chain i should have known better .
oh my gosh , what a disaster !
no big deal , right ?
the kitchen that was utterly chaotic .
our server nowhere to be seen .

slow service and very few folks eating .
this place is awful .
that 's why few cars in the lot consistently .
chicken was weird looking though .
so it looked like he had his hands full .
first the mac and cheese bites .
essentially it was just melted parmesan and mozzarella .
this franchise is barely hanging on !
way over priced for the terrible food .
food was not good .
so salty and bland .
if there was a star for bad service ... .
i would give them _num_ .
there is no one to help anyone !
this place sucks and ca n't get anything right .

it was a dirty place .
it was not a pleasant site .
the reviews were pretty mixed .

overall , no need to return .
thank god i went with a groupon .
this restaurant is terrible .
that was the first bad sign .
only problem ; no strawberries !
the wait was longer then needed to be .
we will not be going back ever .
i 'm so disappointed .
the cook said `` no '' .

the coffee had no taste whatsoever .
this place should not be in business .
the pancakes were ok , but nothing great .
i would not recommend this place .
my wife did not like the apple pancake .
my raspberry pancake was ok.
kind of small portion for $ _num_ .
i would not return here for breakfast .

overpriced for mediocre food .
nothing blew me away , except my company .

i 'm very disappointed .
the restaurant was not even half full .
the horrible experience did not end there .
we arrived and our reservation was missing .
$ _num_ per person .
they missed the whole prom basically .
the food it 's self was not real exciting .
unfortunately this time it was n't so great .

written to warn others .
make the mistake we did .
this restaurant is pretentious and overpriced .
food was just ok , not great .

worse service i have ever experienced .
overall , a totally disappointing anniversary dinner !
the pricing for value literally is insulting .
almost upsetting how bad that experience remains .

the service was really professional and nice .
but it was a bit ridiculous .
my daughter would n't even eat it .
it was comparable to airplane food .
worst food i 've ever had .
had a reservation for _num_ people on easter .
what started out as something fun became a disaster .
the main course was the worst .
none of this took place , of course .
the bread was stale and rock hard .
i would not recommend going here .
it still looks like i cut my own hair .
no , i 'm not coming back at all .
the food is okay but lacks any serious flavor .
i could n't stand being there .
the machines are disgusting .
and it 's not very sanitary ? ''
do n't get a pedicure .
the staff is polite , helpful and knowledgable .
decent health club but a bit outdated .
i can not comment on her actual diagnosis .
i have no reason to trust it .
there really is n't anything special about this place .
very salty and my chicken was burnt .
not it 's ok for a change .
franchise owners should be held more responsible .
very poor food not top quality .
but wait , it gets worse !
my suggestion is -- never ever use them .
she did n't even try .
major attitude the entire time .
without a bad attitude .
shame on you for hiring such an awful associate .

this place is terrible for many reasons .
needless to say , i was not impressed .
wow , what an absolute shame .
sorry guys , not coming back .
manager did not do anything .
waited over _num_ min with no explanation .
not respectful of your time .
thus , the mri was wrong on two accounts .
to say i am pissed off is an understatement .
terrible customer service at this location !
are you kidding me ?
i had a procedure done in december _num_ .
also i have appreciated the sunday pick-up hours .

after the coupon it was $ _num_ .
the texture was seriously damaged .
i am standing here as i write this .
i 've been here for _num_ min already .

it 's now been _num_ min and counting .
there just were n't many options to be had .
and they ran out of napkins at lunch time .
part of the problem is my fault .
the menu was rather bland and disappointing .
it 's too thick for me .
after two bites i finally threw the sandwich away .
it tasted like someone poured pickle juice on it .
obviously i will never go back .
unfortunately i was told only sunday .
they 're lucky i gave them _num_ star .
not a fan any more !
it was not real flavorful .
it did not have it .
fish tacos tasted old and definitely not fresh .
the chips and dip were awesome .
problem was they forgot alot .
very bad service tonight !
she does n't belong here !
the chips & salsa are better than most .
the rest of the food was mushy and bland .
then it was downhill .
our waiter was either very awkward or arrogant .
so i walked out .
the restaurant was dead .
my `` steak '' tacos tasted like beef jerky .
-i will never be back .

this parking lot sucks .
there 's something wrong with this chain .

no juicy beef patty .
so i 'm spoiled .
the overall burger taste was bland , uninspired .
the fries : again , nothing special .
definitely not a fan !
i would not go there again .
i would not recommend nor go there again .
that is not cool .
worst burger experience i 've had in recent memory .
not like i remember it .
i hate this greedy restaurant .
this is the worst place to eat food .
there is not a lot of flavor .
i am telling you , you will regret it .
talking to their management does nothing .
seriously , you do n't need to go here .
had a bad car repair experience with them .

parts of the ceiling missing .
that was my fault .
unfortunately , i had a terrible experience here .

not a good value at all .
very slow service when ordering food as usual .
the worker was rude as could be .
this place is not worth the money !

they allowed my husband to leave .

i would still like to try the mushroom enchilada .
the service , however , was not so good .
the salsa is pretty bad .
oh well , ok place for a quick lunch .
my first visit to ajo al 's .
you will only be ignored and lied to .

the taco had a hard thick tasteless shell .
the tamale was the worst .
it was so wet that it just fell apart .
we were so disappointed .

too many great places to go in scottsdale .
do n't waste your time or money here .

plus no music etc .
never going back to ajo al again .
long time customer for several years but no more .
this was the worst service i have ever received .
she was rude , unprofessional , and very sarcastic .
he then hung up on me .
will never use this store for shipping again .
they seem very unorganized .
they sometime even blew it off completely !
the interior amenities were very cheap .
the cabinet doors would frequently come off .
i would not recommend this place .
they 're a nightmare to rent from .
it was pretty bland , very little flavor .
he explained that he does not accept those .
i guess i just did n't get it .
forget it , they will forget to bring them .
first impression : not so great .
i did not want money just an exchange .
when i checked out , the cashier was rude .
however they did charge me $ _num_ !

my bagel had no chew whatsoever .
worst breakfast burrito for too much money .

the salsa was the horrible nyc type .
not really my cup of tea .
i am surprised by all of these great reviews .
just butter is a $ _num_ up charge .
never mind the customers i guess .
the bagel was small , no additions were served .
we have had a bad experience with this place .
sadly , this is not that place .
the bagels tasted like wonder bread .

i really did n't recognize anyone .
not impressed by this place .
first of all , they were slow .
the staff was simply rude to us .
moreover , it was $ _num_ !
this is too far from it .
they get _num_ stars vs. _num_ for being local .
coffee was terrible , again stale .
lame for the price we paid .
then when it came out it was wrong .
then they proceed to change my order .
it 's not mcdonald .
i would have given them a negative star .
not a good sign .
unfortunately , not the case .
we will not be going back .
even with a coupon this place is expensive .
so , i went to the pizza ... .
i took a bite and was thoroughly disappointed .
i paid my bill and left disappointed .
do n't waste your time & money !
nothing like focaccia bread .
sweet potato chips were bland .
wings are ok but overall i hate zipps .
i also i feel the beer should be cheaper .
the chips were a little burned .
the food was disappointing to say the least .
service was incredibly slow .
that 's not ok !
unfortunately , zipps has lost my business .
this place will never get my business again .
save your money , go elsewhere .
truly rude and definitely incompetent .
this location though is seriously lacking .
i 'm not making this up .
all of our food was cold when received it .
this place is terrible .
the first sip was like drinking a sugar mix .

horrific customer service skills there .
they do n't even want to talk to you .
this was the place for me !
also , the installation was horrible !
office staff not helpful at all .
it is very frustrating and annoying .
they just do n't do a good job anymore .
the other $ _num_ is theirs to keep .
a majority of these problems are maintenance related .
it just went downhill from there .
they did not even come close to being concerned .
i could not recommend this hotel for this reason .
i was not impressed with this clinic .
the staff was not very friendly .
we recently started taking our cats to this vet .
this was _num_ weeks ago .
however , his office over billed me .
i would have saved $ _num_ !

on top of that , rude service .

i could have a better salad at super salad .
last night we had the worst dining experience ever !
do n't know if we will ever come back .
well , i 'm signing off on this joint .
the appetizers came out but not b & b .
nothing to write home about .
i would say avoid this place like the plague .
we were seated and were given menus .
when they finally arrived they were luke warm .
needless to say , there were returned again .
the mashed potatoes were cold .
but , my husband 's experience was terrible .
it arrived undercooked and cold .
meanwhile his mother and i finished our meals .
our check was about $ _num_ per person .
the fresh fish selection is horrible .
do n't waste your money on this joint .
the hostess was rude and incompetent .
the caesar was drenched in dressing and not tossed .
the others were mediocre .
the chicken was immediately sent back to the kitchen .
the desserts came out , they were ok .
then she told me to sit at the bar .
my table was ready but she was n't .
it was _num_ % empty by the way .
really disappointed in the food and the service .
my _num_ yr old could 've made it better .
presentation was bad too .
they are basically average dishes that are significantly over-priced .
and then one drink order was wrong .
had the baked shrimp , pretty dry .
do n't think so .
that 's an extra $ _num_ .
i doubt they were even fresh .
i thought she was getting sick .
the service was fine but nothing special .
this was not the case .
i was very disappointed with the food .
i will be spending my money elsewhere .
we were very disappointed !
probably the reason the restaurant was fairly empty .
nothing to write home about .
the ambiance is very stale .
the food tasted like cafeteria food very average .
years and omg too much plastic surgery over there !
you have a mediocre product .
she was totally rude and sarcastic .
thumbs down on service and attitude .
i would never buy anything from them again !
so i wrote them a check for _num_ .
i would not recommend this place !
will not be back here again .
the front desk was rude .
i had to wait _num_ hours to check in .
i did n't even get my drink replaced .
keep in mind this is about _num_ yards away .
so why ask me if it 's ok ?
that is bad for this type of resort .
no excuse for such poor service .
i 'm not sure what happened there .
i blame the major lack on the management .
he has no business in the service industry .
sorry i just had to .
rude people run the front desk and security .
beds not as comfortable as they should be .
hyatt trying to save money ?
but this imho is a management issue .
lack of standards and possible budget restrictions .
this is not an experience location .
the staff are friendly but not so helpful .
the rooms are dusty and do n't feel clean .
the food is pricey and not really worth it .
we left the hotel to go to another pool .
cleanliness throughout the resort must not be a priority .
the resort seems extremely understaffed .
i waited _num_ minutes just to check in .
i am a hyatt platinum card holder ... .
spent two nights here and checked out early .
for $ _num_ a night we expect much better .
- the room service and food options are limited .
no pizza , yet they have an italian restaurant .
this was the only gem of the place .
i do n't think its a good system .
you know , that old gym nasty smell .
which explains why the cleaning smell was so strong .
$ _num_ in camera gear stolen from my room .
they charge for parking .
this is not downtown nyc or la .
there was nothing special or magnificent about it .
nothing - no follow up - nothing .
it was terrible - not relaxing at all .
but no customer service .
called to confirm down free room .
a room with down pillows and down comforter !
in az no less .
completely ruined our staycation !
too bad it 's all ruined !
they would not transfer me to anyone higher .
completely ruined our staycation !
too bad it 's all ruined !
i would think twice about booking this again .
there was also no microwave in this room .
rather a low class , trashy crowd .
they do n't care about you as a patient .
do not trust his on line advertising .
complete waste of your money and time !
the food is ok , not great .
i am especially disappointed in their delivery times .
and they do n't even apologize .
anyways , should have tried someplace else .
unfortunately , my wife was right .
absolutely the worst customer service !
my experience was terrible .
not bad , but not good either .
i will not be back .
now let 's move on to the food terrible !
pork fried rice bland .
do n't waste your money on this place !
is n't rice cheap ?
this place is hit or miss !
however , the food was not good .
the worst was the chicken fried rice .
the odor was unbearable and the chicken looked inedible .
there is very little meat in anything .
i drove _num_ minutes to pick it up ... .
literally over _num_ hours .
delivery was _num_ minutes late .
chicken was over fried .
delivery person was not friendly .
not sure where they put the egg .
no need to go back regardless of how close .
we will not try this restaurant again .
they have horrible customer service .
probably the worst customer service ever .
just a lost opportunity to please the customer !
so , you ask , were there any positives ?
otherwise , avoid it .
the resort is n't really great either .
seems like anyone can get a _num_ star rating .
parking was a disaster .
i 've stayed here several times over several years .
but that does n't make it ok .
otherwise , it is annoying .
the resort is dated and in need of updating .
the beds were not comfortable .
this facility is over rated and not reliable .
cell phone reception was totally gone .
not likely to return here anytime soon by choice .
this restaurant gives the resort a bad rep .
however , we were both disappointed in this one .
the bathroom was outdated .
did n't seem like management cared .
probably will not return to this place .
not very impressed for a resort .
plus the spa is very small .
my experience at the hotel was not good .
i wo n't be coming back .
pita chips are crunchy .
this was just plain hard pita bread .
food arrived quickly and it was hot .

sitting out by the pool today and it sucked .
the food was horrible and took _num_ minutes .
not pleased at all .
the staff is unhelpful and rude .
this was not a good thing .

the staff was relatively nice but inept .
mediocre food , mediocre service , high prices .
the rooms are dark and dingy with low ceilings .
i booked this hotel on hotwire .
star rating is wrong .
rooms are very outdated .
i was disappointed to say the least .
this is disgusting and unsanitary .
the staff is completely incompetent .
the hotel claimed nothing could be done .
our room was n't ready until 6:30pm .
rooms are quite dated .
disappointed and wo n't stay again .
there was no cover on one of the outlets .
no one was at the desk .
possibly the worst apartment complex in town .
do n't care about the customer at all .
will not be back .
taking my business down the street .
do n't bother coming here very unfriendly staff .
not sure if anyone is running this business .
i have never experienced this reaction to anything before .
disgusting and i threw the whole thing away .
probably all beef but who knows .
maybe left over from the day before or frozen ?
bad customer service to i guess .
so i turn to yelp to let others know .
not gon na come back again .
my wife felt so uncomfortable we had to leave .
totally ruined my day !
total , $ _num_ .
they 've lost a customer .
the food is just pitiful .
even the fortune cookie was sub par .
the food is barely mediocre .
so i joined desert schools instead .
- their email does not work .
i am so beyond pissed at desert schools .
i refuse to deal with them anymore .
my mobile checking deposit was turned off without warning .
cash for coin though ?
sorry though , just ca n't do it .
his staff did register me .
only then did they pay attention .
i bought elsewhere , for cheaper no less .
customer service is garbage .
thats were the good stops though .
so maybe that is another plus .
i 've taken friends and family there to shoot .
very disappointed and feel like they stole from me .
neither emails nor telephone calls were answered .
that 's too bad .
they ignore customers and act very condescending .
mike , ( tall skinny guy ) .
the legal instructor was rude , and unprofessional .
this is a typical scottsdale establishment .
overall a very disappointing experience .
consider me a former customer .
i did this for about _num_ minutes .
it 's not worth the drama !
bakery staff not friendly or helpful at all .
they act like they do n't need your business .
wish the bakery could get their act together .
is n't that what a deli is all about ?
this store continues to go downhill .
horrible service at this store .
buying organic milk is also a hit or miss .
is it really that difficult to manage inventory ?
do n't employee get trained ?
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
the night staff could use some customer service training .
i found someone to shut the alarm off .
she would not return my calls .
so i dropped some of my towels off .
uh , stealing dirty towels ?
this place used to be very customer oriented .
they turned out terrible .
little respect for your time .

but ok , not a big deal .
this place was a mess .
dirty tables , dirty dishes , dirty restrooms .
sad because this place was a favorite .
such a rip off !
that gets _num_ star from me .
i seriously do n't get it .
it 's not very good pizza .
this place is comparable to buca di beppo .
ok ... i 'm not getting the hype .
the thin crust , however , was a disaster .
it was like eating cardboard .
tough , chewy and flavorless .
i just got tired of it .
oregano 's , you screwed me .
do you understand how insulting that comment was ?
that is bad , dude !
that just makes the whole experience even worse .
once we ordered bartender really never noticed us again .
i do n't get it .
no way am i a fan of the food .
each time i go there are flies everywhere .
i do n't get it .
instead it came with _num_ tiny bites .
it will be replaced as our go-to weekend restaurant .
did n't take a sip , by the way .
so i just ordered a bottled beer .
they need to acknowledge their problems and solve them .
this review is only for their stuffed pizza .
this pizza is not good .
i hear that the thin crust is better .

i called corporate and raised hell .
this was really strange and extremely extremely insulting .
kohl 's is so underwhelming and disappointing .
later , my pants split .
my shirt had a hole in it .
a button popped off .
the years have not been kind to this building .
this place actually gets _num_ stars .
the first time i called i waited _num_ min .
i drove around for _num_ min .
instead of crown he filled my tooth .
you 've missed crack on my tooth .
do not trust your dentist .
fridge is n't full yet .
asked for ranch with my chicken fingers .
apparently once is n't enough .
i gave you another shot and never again .
i went for food for _num_ people .
i 'm once again without food .
do not go to this location .
here 's the story .
tried a green smoothie , the apple and greens .
worst customer service of all time .
might be bad management it 's hard to say .
the next day i was going to stay again .
it was a nightmare .
rude front desk clerk , jack .
would n't stay here again even for free .
it was disgusting and gave me a headache .
this review is long overdue .
unfortunately we were _num_ minutes away already .
anyways my point is i 'm a guest too !
my advice is to find another place to stay .
i 'm never coming here again .
absolutely miss scottsdale , but definitely not this business .
settled payment with under $ _num_ but really ?
note : sure deposit is a joke .
i do n't recommend this apartment .
it should have been $ _num_ each time !
i am quite simply appalled .
oh , bicycle ranch -- where should i begin ?
i decide to leave the bike there .
end result : fail .
he does n't listen to your requests .
i will never spend another dime in this place !
sorry , but we wo n't be back .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the vets do not know what they are doing .
nothing too hard , _num_ minutes is fine .
_num_ people were there , counting me .
i did n't care anymore .
chicken and bread was cold when i got it .
nasty , nasty , nasty !
they do absolutely no follow-up and could care less .
advice ... find another doctor .
took it elsewhere and it was immediately repaired .
shame when a business changes and quality goes down .
do n't let this happen to you .
the others i 've had have been very rough .
i am forced to try some other nail salons .
that is the only nice thing i can say .
i simply have never experienced horrid service like this .
felt like my mani/pedi was not done very well .
so why spend more for rude attention ?
i recently got into the gel manicure trend .
the polish on them is horrible !
the sides and bottom were not polished .
one of the worse jobs i 've ever had .
she does n't care at all about her customers .
do not waste your money on this place !
i made a huge mistake by going here !
this comment completely blew me away .
she had the worst nail experience of her life .
the place looks nice but has poor business practices .
service here is hit or miss .
front desk extremely rude and unprofessional .
no other business would keep its employees .
their staff was not friendly at all .
home of the ten dollar burrito ?
first , the salsas are lacking .
i 'm really disappointed in this location .
this restaurant has been going downhill .
the chicken was chewy and disgusting .
i do n't think i 'll bother going again .
this is not good service.
it is slow & inefficient .
the manager is more clueless than the staff .
i will not be back , mark my words .
bathrooms and restaurant floors a complete disaster .
sure hope chipotle reads these reviews .
slowest chipotle i have ever been to .
watching people leave after standing in line so long .
worst chipotle i 've ever been to .
employees were super rude from start to finish .
avoided the entire middle of my burrito .
i will not be returning to this location .
this chipotle is very very slow .
not impressed at all with this location .
just came from this location .
_num_ for one tiny scoop of meat ripped off .
nice concept but lacking so much .
two people on that line is not enough .
um , hell no .
that 's just gross .
i will not return to this location ever again .
worst chipotle i 've ever been to !
i am never going back .
`` oh , i 'm sorry .
for starters , the burgers .
the value for quality is n't there .
but the service was atrocious .
so , where was the horrible service ?
we waited for _num_ mins and still no fries .
it was poor service on their part .
i would give them a _num_ if i could .
sadly this is not what i received .
sorry red robin , we wo n't be back .
but , those days are done .
the service is inconsistent .
i really do not like this .
we wo n't be going back .
nothing worked for me .
however , i feel strongly about this .
this is by far one of the worst starbucks .
i stopped coming to this starbucks .
i absolutely will not go back to this starbucks .
this used to be one of my favorite starbucks .
sad to say , not anymore .
but , i did n't , i said ok .
she did , and it processed correctly .
still just as horrible .
would n't kill you to smile and be friendly !
she is curt and just unfriendly in general .
not surprising , he did it anyway .
that was the problem .
not a jiffy lube place .
what a bunch of incompetent idiots .
very slow service every single time i come in .
very incompetent every time i show up here .
the workers here are very friendly but extremely slow .
i hate leaving bad reviews .
the box for cleaning the windows was checked .
jiffy lube just lost me as a customer .
$ _num_ for a synthetic oil change .
case in point , air pressure on the tires .
unfortunately , even the two cashiers got behind !
i said ok no problem .
poor service all the way around .
baristas are not genuinely kind here.
there 's no privacy there in that regards !
nobody wants to wait in long lines .
long wait times and poor customer service !
i arrived _num_ minutes early for my 5:00 appointment .
meanwhile _num_ people went in ahead of me .
the first available appointment was december 3rd .
there was a terrible wait .
the factory store has crazy insane prices on bread .
however , the day old bread is extremely unappealing .
no one in my house would even eat it .
i never went inside the store after driving there .
everyone except one person had the same problem .
not sure of the owners name .
worst doctor and staff !
i did n't end up getting the shot .
poor customer service and lack of communication .
i scheduled my appointment for _num_ .
do not recommend and will never go back .
the staff is terrible .
worst staff i ever came across .
i 'm pretty disappointed .
sushi was just ok , nothing to rave about .
supposedly , their serving size is for _num_ people .
not very noticeable from the parking lot .
this place is ok i guess .
the restaurant has no ambience .
overall the rolls had little flavor and were bland .
it was nearly empty on a saturday night .
and the layout of the place is terrible .
just was n't really impressed with anything .
disappointing for a sushi restaurant .
and it was cooked salmon .
2nd visit here and 2nd time receiving horrible service .
the sushi is ok and the service is awful .
the service at sushi ko was terrible .
our waitress was rude .
the sushi itself was acceptable , if forgettable .
second visit could be better described as an attempt .
strike three , you 're out , sushi ko .
so a client of mine picked this for dinner .
# _num_ the sushi sucked .
i was really disappointed in the food .
steady fish , hit or miss .
traditional favorites , but where is the passion ?
i echo the service problems of other reviewers !
no need to bother coming here .
only _num_ in the order for $ _num_ .
would not come again or recommend .
we just returned last eve .
their listed hours mean nothing !
average sushi , with weak service .
i will not return again .
the food was so-so ... nothing memorable .
profit over client care ?
it sure upset me , once i realized it .
lots of wasted time .
i walked out and never went back .
it was scheduled about _num_ weeks out .
rescheduled _num_ weeks further out .
never had this before .
one of several horrible times .
this place is terrible stay away .
nursing quality very poor .
weekend night nurse was the worst .
she could n't eat the rice and sour cream .
hey chipotle , where is the meat ?
costly mistake , do n't you make it !
do not use this place !
you 're killing me !
i never sweat the small stuff .
the guy is rude !
to me this is poor business .
i should have received a full $ _num_ refund .
a waste of $ _num_ .
do not go to this place !
would not recommend at all !
the owner is the turn off at the business .
teachers do n't pay that close attention .
no teacher near her .
but , then i had a bad experience .
i felt so sick that i threw up .
how rude is that ?
i will not be returning .
i was in twice this week .
you 're a crappy burger joint near a walmart .
got the order wrong ... .
this location and the manager are a total joke .
sara , your customer service skills suck .
none at all after waiting at the counter forever .
was only _num_ of _num_ cars in line .
maybe i do n't look like a motorcycle mama .
stopped at scottsdale harley to get my oil changed .
the service department sucks .
but had no price tag on it .
so jeff hook me up on a test ride .
the dealership is about _num_ hours from my house .
that is not why i am upset .
this was `` before '' the build .
i guess i 'm more into the hometown feel .
i would strongly avoid this place !
are you kidding me ?
they would not refund our money .
they are just bad .
this stuff is just too high priced .
our chicken parmesan arrived obviously microwaved .
the pizza is n't even close .
very bland , not much flavor .
the usually good food was disappointing .
and the linguini with clam sauce was tasteless .
stick with sandwiches and pizza .
uninspired and blend pizza !
it 's just not what it once was .
the crust was black b/c it was so burnt .
truly disappointed and will never be back .
never again will we be going to the restaurant !
the bread should have been toasted more as well .
after about _num_ bites , the salad was gone .
are you kidding me ?
i 'm positive you 'll be disappointing .
i just do n't get it .
this place feels like a tgi fridays .
there are better options .
the food was n't too bad .
my husband had the fish tacos which were good .
we went there tonight after costco .
a groupon would normally state that .
i waited _num_ minutes just to get the check .
there is nothing really stand out about this place .
do not order food from here if it matters .
terrible drinks and mediocre food .
was not impressed at all !
it 's _num_ degrees people !

2:30 i get a call from another person .
carpet in spare bedroom ruined .
i lost my job over a year ago .
it was my girlfriends birthday last week .
by day _num_ the arrangement looked a week old .
i would not recommend them .
this tastes nothing like mexican food .
food is n't the best .
you can get better elsewhere .
- no place to be found !
this fell short in many ways .
my kids cheese crisp was ... lame .
and the chips were no big deal .
the pastry dough was chewy , and lacked salt .
i could get better quality at food city .
dont wan na go back .
chicken obviously is n't supposed to be pink .
not sure why i kept going back .
not the end of the world .
this place was pretty bad .
low budget food at high budget prices .
soda 's were flat .
the food was a total disappointment .
the nachos were huge but not good at all .
too expensive for the quality .
i would never return to this place .
also no waters were given to us until requested .
this restaurant is expensive with poor food and service .
not very clean and not very cool .
we ate here for lunch .
it took another _num_ minutes to get our food .
needless to say , we wont be going back .
not sure what happened and it 's a shame !
never ever will go there again .
i was so annoyed .
when the food arrived it was nasty .
terrible service from beginning to end .
bad hosts , bad server .

restaurant _num_ % full .
camelback store does not have this problem .
guess there 's no hope .
my friends drink was just as bad .
i lost a bet .
i ate about two bites before sending it back .
bad choice for a saturday lunch .
no big deal i guess .
one burrito and a grilled chicken salad .
i also blame their management for poor training .
if the restaurant is bad , imagine the kitchen !
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican .
the parking was a little weird .
needless to say we wo n't be returning .
after several minutes of waiting , we left .
wo n't be coming back here again .
now , i am not a super strict vegetarian .
but what really turned me off was the bill .
$ _num_ does not make sense .
i really wish hygiene were more of a priority .
house margs are good cheap and big .
horrible service , greasy food , orders always incorrect .
bad experience to say the least .
and to make matters worse the food is disgusting !
horrible , overpriced , reheated frozen crap .
they should be embarrassed .
page menu , plastic rice , terrible meals .
i then ordered to fish tacos which were horrible .
unfortunately , the enchilada was horrible .
it was tasteless , old and completely falling apart .
this place just sucks .
could n't remember why .
it 's not like these fajitas were cheap either .
what happened to this place .
wo n't be visiting this location again !
service was spotty and the food was so-so .
dirty and bad service .
do n't use the bathroom .
my wife got the chicken chili relleno .

the food here is so salty and gross .
my friend 's burrito looked nothing like the photo .

went tonight for first time .
should not even give it one star .
our server was rude , disrespectful and completely incompetent .
i can not believe how bad the service was .
never ever going back .

there yelp , is that enough info for ya !
please save yourself the headache and look else where .
management is almost nonexistent .
i quit after _num_ holes .
after yesterday though , i hate the place .
just a poor experience and will not be returning .
as you can imagine it was quite the mess .
the starter said too bad .
i 'm never going back .
too many other options in the valley to play .
skip it and find another course .
and charge them $ _num_ per person .
overall it was a very expensive and disappointing experience .
overall it was a very expensive and disappointing experience .
the man tells me $ _num_ each way .
the man tells me $ _num_ each way .
poor customer service even though they say satisfaction guaranteed .
just poor form on the drivers part .
worst customer service ever .
unless you want your night ruined .
i am so disgusted .
they are just the worst !
i just had the worst experience with this service .
the driver was _num_ mins late with no call .
there are too many other car services available .
my second ride was awful .
not honest and no integrity .
so ok , i guess .
i should have insisted upon a receipt .
insist upon a receipt no matter what they say .
it 's like a bad it department .
the options described on the website are extremely deceiving .
overall , a terrible experience .
totally not worth it .
was i free to sit anywhere i want ?
of course , no !
where is the _num_ calorie meals ?
the service was about as bad as it gets .
the food was n't very good either .
this place gets negative two stars .
i recently went there for lunch .
i will not be going back to this chilis .
they used to have better food !
no pico de gallo .
we also ordered the california grilled chicken flatbread appetizer .
they tasted weird , not like how i remember .
they were seasoned very poorly .
the food was horrible .
it did not taste fresh and everything was cold .
medium rare does not mean rare and cold .
we ordered takeout and it was horrible .
the smoked chicken wings were dry and very small .
the mashed potatoes were dry and tasteless .
the cheese bites were terrible .
he said , can i get you another salad ?
the manager failed to offer any other resolution .
it 's very unfortunate .
they tried to rip us off !
as plain as day !
very poor customer service !
i do n't know where it came from .
maybe i did n't seem important enough to help ?
you started off so well ... .
i know i sound like a brat .
i would not recommend working with this company .
they have no common sense what so ever .
do n't waste your time .
disappointing waste of time !
do not buy high end appliances from this company .
it is not always worth it .
he blamed the hood company for not shipping .
no refund and no refrigerator !
who needs bad service like that ?
this is no way to treat a former customer .
do n't risk it , go elsewhere .
i 'm not a fan .
i ordered asada burrito with beef .
one bite another bite all i taste was lettuce .
i 'm not crazy about the blue burrito grill .
this was not that place .
the food was cold .
they got my order wrong .
disappointed , just another mex chain restaurant .
i would rate them _num_ 1/2 stars .
more than chipotle and not as fresh i think .
this is my second visit , and maybe last ?
not worth it to sit in a taxi .
we never make appointments ( just walk in ) .
these guys suck bad !
long time customer but not any longer .
never have i given a review this low .
i could n't believe how unprofessional this company was .
skip this joint ... .
the service was terrible .
how can italian sausage be tasteless !
here 's a pic of the pathetic pie .
fifteen dollars , ladies and gentlemen .
that 's $ _num_ per shrimp !
she got tired of rice .
she stated no problem .
ordered for my two children the gluten free pizza .
_num_ minutes later , no slices .
manager does not come over .
i would not recommend ever stepping foot in there .
i walked out of the office towards my car .
dozens of employees ran out asking to assist me .
i was treated rude right off the bat !
not the cheapest car to own or drive !
do n't treat me or others like crap !
no body , no favor .
the service was terrible and so was the food .
but , hey , free lunch .
they do not sell or give away stickers .
none of us had started the new beers .
and wear normal t-shirt sizes .
the oldest on staff must have been _num_ .
the problem with the restaurant , is the price .
okay , yes ... the place is loud .
right off , a turn off .
needless to say , we will not be back .
however , that was not what we got .
even my pint of beer was $ _num_ .
the flavors were n't bad , though .
crispy , cold and fresh salad mix .
frozen , then refried .
red sauce lost its quality too .
# burgers are a miss in every way .
waited another _num_ for a server .
in this case , stick to the original .
this four peaks seem stale and old .
the burgers were just ok nothing outstanding .
it was more like overpriced fish sticks .
fat fat and more fat .
just not my thing i guess .
nothing to get excited about here .
in short , our server forgot about us .
not a place for football sunday !
why is everything diet here ?
i do n't get it .
eggs had no taste .
make sure you get everything in writing .
how did they mess up our reservation ?
we ended up very much not happy .
what an incredibly bad experience .
not attentive at all .
i looked around the windows and doors dept .
worst customer service i have ever received .
it 's two months later and no gift card !
well , is n't this awkward ?
one star is one star too many .
not very healthy either .
i would not recommend to a friend .
i hate that it 's never the same .
clearly should have stopped going after the first visit .
no normal food here .
first and last time here .
this location was a disaster .
not worth the money .
my sandwich was poorly thrown together .
but the last is the worst .
over _num_ for a lens i will never use .
the selection was boring !
this should 've been the first warning .
so that _num_ weeks turned into _num_ weeks .
i can not recommend this to anyone .
the last thing i tried was the beef enchiladas .
skip the frozen margaritas !
the carne asada -- not good .
it was very salty and kind of gross .
i feel bad because our server was so nice !
star _num_ - how was the service and atmosphere ?
even for gourmet mexican , that 's too much .
especially paying $ _num_ ?
unfortunately all i got was the greasy part .
do n't waste your time or money !
sad to say we were sorely disappointed !
had the buffet ... absolutely terrible .
we went there for lunch yesterday .
you can get better food and service elsewhere .
do not waste your time and money .
it only costs $ _num_ more each !
your sign says breakfast until _num_ .
meh , very mediocre .
the meeting lasted _num_ hours .
steve knew this and said `` no problem '' .
this company does not even deserve _num_ star .
my gel manicure did n't even last a week .
my daughter did n't care for her nail lady .
gel pedi , french mani and eyebrows .
all three were not good quality .
all three services were $ _num_ .
my office is only _num_ miles from their location .
this place is the worst .
poor customer service and sells expired food .
she indicated she would have a designer contact me .
overall i 'm disappointed with the results .
luckily , he signed off on the extra expense .
has lost its way .
glad i switched to another place .
i would n't recommend this company .
i lost a days work for nothing .
they do not install on saturdays .
this time my wife lost a days work .
a month has gone by still no follow up .
expensive and somewhat disappointing .
lost our future business .
pretty bad customer service or should i say non-existent .
there are better clinics that you can trust .
pretty bad customer service or should i say non-existent .
there are better clinics that you can trust .
service was marginal and food was not very good .
unfortunately , there are so many broken seats !
i like that they have light lemonade though .
however , i am _num_ years old .
_num_ called , they want their theatre back .
however , the seats are super uncomfortable .
small screens , big time price .
where is the stadium seating ?
small screens because the theaters are small .
that 's only adding insult to injury .
no online seat reservations like regal and others .
the larger problem was the seats themselves .
our normal theater is a regal in gilbert .
nothing could be further from the truth .
regal and amc have my business .
also , if you have a cough stay home !
also another issue and this for all theaters .
turns out the pump was completely destroyed .
however , the last winter they failed to come .
worst company to work with .
had multiple problems with installation as well .
how wrong i was .
by this time it was _num_ min into apt .
really tee 'd off the wife .
bad experience from entrance to exit ... not recommended .
the ice cream cake we just purchased was horrible !
$ _num_ bucks for this ?
who is more disappointed the kids or the parents ?
not the friendliest folks in there .
do n't waste your time or taste buds !
food is inconsistent at this location .
the bad : pork egg rolls .
i tried calling the mgr all morning .
no one picked up until 11:30 .
tell that to my toilet !
i 'm no longer going .
just keeps getting worse .
gluten free asian fusion is not difficult .
probably will not be returning any time soon .
only took five minutes to tour .
i did like the sand in the bunkers .
the greens were horrible .
set up a _num_ man tournament here .
the service was terrible .
if you dont own , dont go there .
other staff seem to be quite friendly .
but i was quickly over that .
just plain awkward and uncomfortable .
the food is completely uninspired .
the flat iron steak was fine but not spectacular .
no lotion , no massage , nothing .
not a four seasons more like a double tree .
this was one thing that really ruined my stay .
a five star hotel should not have stained carpets .
not what i expect from a four seasons .
i was there from feb _num_ through _num_ .
i was not able to use the patio .
unbelievably disappointing mothers day experience at the four seasons .
my smoked chicken cob salad was very disappointing .
the iceberg lettuce was brown and soggy .
what a sad experience for a _num_ star hotel .
my steak was so-so .
not a comfortable atmosphere from the baristas .
everyone much more friendly at carefree highway store !
walked out without buying the items i picked out .
seriously rude & condescending staff .
the manicure was not .
i would not recommend this salon .
the food was not good .
i was soooo disappointed in all of the food .
the salad was lettuce with ranch thrown on it .
my boyfriend ordered the largest steak dinner $ _num_ .
his steak was the _num_ lb porterhouse .
nothing special and definitely not worth $ _num_ .
he then walked away .
no check printed or presented .
i will never return to this place .
_num_ for the live music too .
overall : i was underwhelmed by my visit .
anyway , this place sucks .
even the corn was ice cold !
how do you mess up corn ?
friendly people but food is only fair at best .
$ _num_ a piece for an onion ring ?
but it must have been a small chicken .
the food is very mediocre .
the steak , a little worse than average .
the host was not much better .
the food was horrible and bland .
nothing was even close to being good .
$ _num_ for corn on the cob ?
is there gold in the beef ?
and the singer they had sucked too .
service was fine but the food was terrible .
very poor sign for a steakhouse !
the burgers only come w/ beans .
potato , salad , and corn are all extra .
what a huge disappointment this restaurant is .
the service was terrible .
this place is terrible !
wtf my dog can cook a cheeseburger .
my dining partner 's porterhouse was cold inside .
beans accompanying the meal were bland .
loud , but that 's what we expected .
horrible service every time .
( yuck ) bacon was burnt to a crisp .
it was literally black and tasted like charcoal .
there will not be a next time .
_num_ minutes for waiter to get to our table .
food came _num_ minutes after we ordered .
otherwise i would not have given them any stars .
$ _num_ to wash a shirt ?
$ _num_ to dry clean a sport coat ?
this subway somehow always makes me sick .
they are quick but not very courteous .
they use a sub-par amount of veggies .
_num_ minutes and still waiting to order sat .
the noodles were spaghetti noodles , not chinese noodles .
the hot and sour soup was orange .
nevertheless , we wo n't go back .
i do n't think i 'll return again .
it 's certainly not worth the prices .
we could n't understand it .
this place is not very good at all .
lettuce tasted like it had dirt on it .
way too expensive for the bad food you get .
small on portions , big on price !
likely wo n't be back .
a $ _num_ mistake adding !
just said they were sorry .
i visited here with my dad for lunch .
frankly , i thought it was terrible .
i ca n't even remember what i ordered .
and , again , cold beer .
this place is awful .
dinner was not even close to good.
shockingly bad may be another way to put it.
the worst thing is the food .
the food i brought home was terrible .
the whole family was very disappointed .
sesame chicken and thai chicken curry .
no apology or any type of compensation .
this was a complete fail .
we will not be back .
my husband and i stopped for take-out .
and unfortunately the food did not not taste good .
lame , lame , lame .
golf was good , service was laughable .
and it absolutely does not .
this fry 's is depressing .
lack of leadership may be a starting point .
wo n't be back .
they act like they do n't need customers .
this store does n't work very well for me .
the cheese is cold though '' .
i could n't even eat it .
i just ended up throwing it away .
they have lost my business .
always regret eating at bk .
there is always something wrong .
very bad experience using the drive-thru this morning !
i would not recommend this contractor .
stylist theresa gets a _num_ star review .
however new owner of salon gets a zero .
are you kidding me ?
this is so lame !
you 've been warned .
we were all extremely disappointed .
greens were slow and uneven .
like that 's my problem .
plus many of the fairways are in terrible shape .
she did a poor job on my toes .
they should have to install ventilation for the workers .
i wo n't be going back .
also , the place was very dingy and dirty .
yuck , just yuck .
the eggplant was greasy and dry .
too inconsistent for me .
maybe it 's cause the crust is too heavy .
there are better options especially in scottsdale .
the receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable .
disappointed , does n't describe how we felt .
counted the cars that evening and _num_ cars existed .
does n't seem very full to me .
the staff is curt and not very consistent .
the rooms are extremely loud !
the amenities are none existent .
this place is a mess !
in the room everything is old and worn out .
the large floor tiles were loose and a hazard .
avoid this place at all costs .
i am very disappointed with how we were treated .
she is frustrated and tells me to spell it .
she does n't want to hear it .

needless to say i wo n't be returning .
ca n't someone take care of these ?
but still _num_ or _num_ would be reasonable !
i hate paying to put air in my tires .
convenient location but not worth the hassle .
better off going down to the circle k 's .
gas is way too expensive here .
gas is n't the only thing overpriced here either .
what company would pay for negative reviews .
why oh why is the grass so long .
never seen grass so long on tees before .
reason for the _num_ stars .
i happened to get a craving for apple pie .
poor food and poor service .

i would n't recommend them to anyone .
in the past from verde nursery , no problems .
both dried out and died .
still need some more herbs though .
they never showed up and never returned my calls .
poor way to run a business .
this business gets zero stars from me .
that 's not the case with this one .
they will never get my business again .
in my opinion , it is n't .
it is n't just about money .
so fast forward now to march _num_ .
i had already given them my card info .
the whole time he 's giving me attitude .
avoid at all cost .
this company was formerly called h k motors .
do not deal with these people .
they might just `` disappear '' on you too !
did i mention that it 's slow ?
slow service and way over priced .
i will not be returning .
it 's unfortunate because the location is very convenient .
the service has never been worse , very slow .
you will waste your money
however there are negatives that out way the positives .

i 'd give them _num_ stars if i could .
left it really wet and now it smells .
horrible experience and high cost .
they did a slap happy crappy job .
unfortunately , his staff is a nightmare .
the staff was very unprofessional .
so i just sucked it up .
this was the worst dentist visit i ever had .
one week went by and no one contacted me .
sent my tax information to them in early march .
not a word from them .
they do n't even deserve that _num_ star .
horrible service , attitude , business ethics .
worst service i have ever gotten !
they have truly screwed me over .
they do n't even deserve one star .
this place is horrible !
i will not be making a return appearance .
i 'm not too familiar with driving around tempe .
i could n't find it .
nasty customer service today .
thanks , but no thanks .
horrible customer service and lack ability to manager customers .
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
i do n't appreciate people like this and left .
i did n't take any chances that night .
and the guacamole and other sauces were mediocre .
anyway , i will not be going here again .
second , this stuff is not fresh .
so , i asked for steak and shrimp fajitas .
it was another ten minutes before they got theirs !
the chicken was tasty , although slightly overcooked .
the sushi was simply unacceptable .
parking was fairly easy , and only $ _num_ .
parking lot staff did nothing to stop them .
the lack of signage for that was annoying .
that would never happen in a major league park .
was n't crowded when we went .
it has nothing to write home about .
worst traffic management at any stadium in america .
there is little to no interaction with the players .
this stadium is terrible .
to make it worse , organization is terrible there .
i really want to like this friendly place .
ca n't see a thing .
first , this is my favorites sub factory location .
2nd order , ingredients wrong again .
should n't have messed with a good thing .
also the bread was noticeably stale .
i 'm assuming it was n't fresh .
vegetables on the sandwich were sparse .
she gave me a free soda .
they all looked very lost and confused .
it went downhill from there .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
both dishes were so flavorless .
very disappointed and i would never go back .
from that point , everything went down hill .
nothing to write home about .
salad and bread = terrible .
after that there was nothing but cheese and noodles .
avoid unless your taste buds are stuck on _num_ .
it also was not that big of a portion .
worst spaghetti and meatballs ever , bar none .
a lady answered the phone and was extremely rude .
i was really disappointed .
i would not recommend dining here .
i think olive garden is better than this .
it was extremely bland and over-priced .
at this point , we just want to leave .
i guess our money is n't good enough there !
sadly , things have been changing last few times .
maybe the owner is losing interest .
horrible experience for my birthday .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
beware of pump number _num_ .

i would n't give this company another dime .
the only problem is they are filthy .
i could not believe what i was hearing .
juice bar does not wash the produce .
the coffee is terrible .
its bitter and has a funky aftertaste .
she was just unpleasant .
rude and unprofessional staff .
even manager was confused .
we just left the store mad .
the salad bar looks so gross .
so many people do not eat pork these days .
signage would have been nice .
the salad bar did not have fresh produce ugh .
just a terrible whole foods experience .
wo n't see ya there .
ruined the surprise for a friend !
i was not impressed with my experience there .
i am not sure why they told me that .
i will not recommend this place .
she said she 'd ask and call me back .
me and the husband walk into the store .
you should try other stores .
i wish yelp allowed zero stars .
this is not stated up front .
i waited over _num_ hours to come for consultation .
if i could give no stars , i would .
okay i was n't sure what it was called .
therefore , i 'm never coming back .
the head massage lasted about _num_ seconds .
but this was n't the worst of it .
most of the services are decent but not spectacular .
i have however had a couple of bad cuts .
i was furious and stressed out beyond belief .
the school 's administration is beyond a mess .
it 's like russian roulette going in there !
i booked this appointment with no issues .
needless to say , we wo n't be returning .
it 's my lunch hour !
feel like i got robbed in a way .
the sandwich is totally inedible .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
i just find that appalling .
i guess i will keep trying in my search .
i do n't even know how that is possible .
i just could n't save the food .
got the breakfast bagel with sausage which was ok .
instead of saying i 'm sorry about that .
you 'd be better off going to mcdonalds .
cons : microwaved eggs , microwaved bacon .
no mayo in the kitchen .
only packets on the counter .
i 'm never going back .
had no problems with the staff .
they never have plain bagels when i go .
it ended up being dry and flavorless .
i used to really like this place .
i am from back east i know .
the locals would complain and not go back .
in tempe there are zero alternatives so i deal .
the sandwich was bland tasting .
staff is clueless and rude to customers .
you get all this for $ _num_ .
it tastes like a $ _num_ steak .
but the `` sirloin '' is definitely not .
will not go back - ever .
overpriced and just not tasty food .
companion # _num_ ordered a bowl of potato soup .
no complaints were heard .
companion # _num_ ordered the cesar salad .
seasoning was adequate but nothing special .
service ... not very attentive .
i 've only ate here a handful of times .
just not for me .
about half of it was not edible .
i will not be back here .
i 've been here _num_ times and it sucks .
manager was standing around .
sure people could 've been cut .
it 's just poor customer service .
we were beyond disappointed .

i also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms ... inedible .
just mush with no `` rooms . ''
my steak was cold , and over done .
filthy , poorly trained employees .
weekends are a nightmare here .
i could n't find food here .
oh , and the parking is atrocious .
they wont leave you alone .
hence my visits to arizona mills .
the crowds , the stores ... ... ick .
but i did find a diamond in the rough .
i avoid those people as best i can .
tempe thinks it won by getting az mills .
why the hell did they put imax here ?
that last sentence was not an exaggeration .
oh , how the mighty have fallen .
stores selling quality merchandise can not survive here .
out of town guests do not visit this mall .
try chandler , or scottsdale fashion square instead .
really crowded on the weekends .
doubt i will be frequenting this place .
also this mall is crazy dirty !
it 's the people there that scare me .
it 's almost too much to handle .
i wo n't go back .
i would not recommend it .
this mall is horrible .
sorry i will stick to my kierland and biltmore !
this facility has really gone down hill .
will not bother going there again .
i 'm really not an outlet shopper though .
that 's not cool at all .
we just walked outside to find a cab .
two of them had their shirts off .
( who does n't like a good discount ?
the choices here suck .
nice dresses but terrible customer service .
they also do n't honor their own discounts .
mmmm , prom is in a few minutes .
i had to wait _num_ min .
really disappointed foot locker .
not my type of etiquette .
finally , the doctors teeth are kind of busted .
ordered from papa johns when staying in phoenix .
no cheese cups and the pizza was burnt .
pizza was cold and pretty much waist of money .
go elsewhere if you want a good meal .
went here with a friend for lunch today .
first off , there was no ac .
no ac in the middle of the summer ?
i will never come back to this dump again .
i had a terrible experience at this place .
a complete waste of money .
the quesadilla was n't much better .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .

grossed my ass out .
sorry , not drunk .
it 's not even a language thing .
the restroom is disgusting .
it smells of piss and mold .
the cake was sooooo bland !

absolute worst experience we had at a bakery .
i would n't recommend honeymoon sweets to anyone .
actually you do n't .
i am so disappointing in their service and quality .
this bakery was sooo disappointing !
there was absolutely no decoration on the cupcakes !
frosting had very little taste to it .
ya i want smoke smell on my organic food .
they also charge for chips and salsa .
they even messed up a veggie burrito .
poor excuse for salsa bar .
the shredded beef tacos were not that good .
no salsa verde or any red sauce at all .
also , get better coffee .
and it was definitely not worth the $ _num_ .
hubby ate even less of his .
worst worst worst mex in all the valley .
no salsa bar to speak of .
( _num_ sets on _num_ rolled tacos . )
the chicken in the enchiladas was dried and old .
we walked in ready to order our lunch .
and trust me , they are n't always good .
ok the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
i 've had food truck food better than this .
the chicken was awful and looked strange .
the prices were unbelievable .
way too expensive especially for the quality .
there are way too many soccer posters .
anyway i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
i ordered an asada arizona burrito and a quesadilla .
bummer with a _num_ year old .
the room was very dirty .
the power was out for a few hours .
was pretty disappointed in this place .
the mini refrigerator had a very fishy smell .
overall i was not happy .
i would not stay at this hotel again .
on the counter but no coffee maker .
altogether a pretty unpleasant experience , would not return .
this was a complete disaster .
we will not be staying at this hotel again .
they are completely disorganized , rude and incompetent .
they require _num_ days notice .
i gave _num_ days notice .
i still have not received my deposit back .
they are rude and do not care at all .
the worst apartment you can ever rent in .
they constantly lie and make up excuses for everything .
do not rent here .
i 'm just not that impressed .
the menu is n't that great .
even she was n't impressed .
it did n't do anything for her .
plus their margaritas are weak .
i am not your bro .
i returned today and everything was horrible .
the steak was dry and tasteless .
this was not the case .
my onion rings were thin and mostly crispy .
thinking about it is giving me a headache .
is n't this a seafood restaurant ?
the service was n't too great either .
even the butter was tasteless .
... and the karaoke sucked as well .
... no silverware also .
worst restaurant experience i have ever had .
the waitress was absolutely terrible .
nothing to write home about .
this was probably the most disappointing chowder .
not a lot of taste .
not a real fan .
my wife had the spaghetti lobster .
so she did n't eat it .
was n't at all impressed .
not impressed at all .
the lobster was small and over cooked .
did n't finish it either .
service could n't be more disorganized .
my first time , was horrible .
it was a tuesday and really slow .
find out my outside server is actually the bartender !
minor problems , i figured .
bartender and staff were very friendly .
maybe the other customers learned their lesson already ?
there is little to no quality control .
service has been a wee bit slow .
dirty table , bathroom , silverware and plates .
the appetizers came out cold and sloppy .
the potatoes were undercooked .
( a very slow night .
almost empty ) we waited _num_ mins .
we handed out menus back .
but clearly did n't care .
a bit ignored tonight .
sadly , it was so bland !
lobster was a little overcooked .
tough lobster nice talkative waiter .
why does she not know the menu .
servers do n't care .
not paying $ _num_ .
my domestic draft was $ _num_ .
after that , it was a complete disaster .
additionally , the time commitment began to get ridiculous .
he did eventually remove the meal from my bill .
the food was n't fresh at all .
slim to no seasoning at all .
no bang for your buck here .
are you kidding me ?
no business name , nothing .
if i could give no stars i would .
the food did n't even taste like chinese food .
it seems to me that the quality has declined .
just a sad day .
the driver was polite and friendly .
the crab puffs were ok .
the pot stickers were terrible .
doughy with barely any filling .
the rice in this case was mushy .
the amount of food was disappointing as well .
not horrible , but i would n't go again .
the flavor was bland for everything too .
the restaurant itself was really run down .
tasted a little off too .
the whole thing was a mess .
i could not take another bite after finding that .
yep it was not good .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
the soup was the only item that arrived hot .
do n't waste your time and money .
lastly , the pork chow mein .
it was a mess .
no drive-thru window , only drive-thru atm .
the parking is also awful .
but it was bad .
i 'm really displeased and regret getting it cut .
she looks so awkward .
shelly offers really poor customer service .
she was completely rude .
tried getting compensation for my dogs terrible haircut .
overall rather unhappy with the experience .
this gym is a hot mess .
the facility itself is not up to health codes .
not one time did someone ever return messages .
my chicken however was too chewy .
do n't get me wrong , its still decent .
not great al all .
i wish i could get my $ _num_ back .
worst chinese i 've ever had .
place is disgusting too .
but it does n't , so i wo n't .
not at all close to any authentic japanese .
not worth the money $ $ .
also , the diet pepsi here tastes really awful .

freezer burnt and tasted of old fryer grease !
what a waste of time , effort and money .
do n't the owners care ?
honestly , i started getting offended .
sadly , i will not be returning .
do n't cheap out .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
shady and try to rip you off !
long story short do not go here !
by _num_ , i left .
in these busy times , not cool .
i pick up my car and that was that .
the whole idea of applebee 's really bothers me .
our service was worse than the food .
so corporate , cheesy , and generic .
and it 's not even cheap !
it 's an american chain restaurant .
no ketchup in bottle at my table .
my fries was cold , hamburger was average .
the service however is terrible .
not a fan of this location .
the bartender was very rude .
they did not even make a brand new one .

this applebee 's sucks complete dick .
it tasted like a fucking sprite .
last time we went , there was no hostess .
how ridiculous is that ?
our server was totally avoiding us .
if i could give no stars i would .
do n't go here after 9pm .
the az mills ross is no exception .
worst ross i 've ever been to .
i could hardly find anything .
today 's lunch was a terrible affair .
overall i 'm extremely disappointed by this location .
not even quite okay but just blah .
there was only meat and cheese on them .
also my wife ordered a chocolate malt .
not bad , just old-fashioned .
my daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen .
worst part : the awful chicken strips .
negative _num_ stars on the gross chicken strips .
not worth it at all .
the service is s l o w !
however , here 's where the problem comes in .
anywho , my patty melt was ok .
needless to say i wo n't be back .
not at _num_ & diner .
avoid at all costs !
i was not overly impressed .
service was incredibly slow .
i would have been terribly upset without it .
no apologies for lack of service .
wo n't be eating here again .
i normally tip minimum _num_ % , not here .
i got $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ .
the waitresses there are very rude .
my scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm .
do n't waste your time or your money .
the greeter had no idea what he was doing .
the insurance is a total rip off .
this sprint store had horrible customer service .
like i said : horrible customer service .
brittany needs to be fired .
this store ripped me off .
i only waited about _num_ minutes .
( though i did have an appointment ) .
however their store hours are wrong .
not true , they open at _num_ .
i called customer service at least _num_ times .
and then `` oh no it 's not .
do n't waste your time walking into this store .
if only i could give a negative rating !
sprint , you have some shady business practices .
i 've been a customer for many years now .
do n't go see him for anything .
once again another terrible experience at this sprint store .
i 'm not understanding what the problem is .
stay away and find another sprint repair location .
complete lack of customer service .
i will not be coming back for anything .
what poor customer service !
i will not return to this location again .
oh , and it 's super expensive .
limited selection of stuff to by across the board .
put your money down and they stuff you .
this place can go to hell !
the waiter was n't even friendly to begin with .
we thought he was joking , he was n't .
i am very disappointed in this place .
but everything else was n't .
service sucked and was incredibly slow .
so i 'm dropping them down to _num_ stars .
would not recommend this place save your money .
as it was , we wo n't come back .
i want the food cooked correctly .
at this point , i 'm irritated and upset .
i just would n't have walked out .
i will not patronize this shop again !
i spoke with randy who was again extremely rude !
called to complain then english was a problem .
avoid like a plague .
i explained my voicemail , he just said ok .
i would not recommend this store to anyone .
i could n't believe my ears .
but i got no response from him .
would recommend avoiding this firm at all costs .
be very careful of using this firm .
very disappointed with my service here .
its so bad , i turned my ac off .
i immediately went back to the counter .
so i 'm off to building _num_ .
at least this would n't stain my clothes .
to the smelly guests : how rude .
i would give zero if i could .
i wo n't be back .
i walked out without making a purchase .
you are better off ordering your supplies online .
the assistant manager was standing in the corner .
i would n't say his office is friendly .
my manicure was horrible .
i will not be going here again for sure .
the worst place in life - very unprofessional !
crappy place as i sit here now .
did n't cover tips of nails with polish .
not worth the price .
i just waste a fortune for nothing over here .
like she gave me hang nails and cut me .
the manicure itself was below average .
and the worst part ?
my biggest mistake was ignoring them .
it was not all bad of an experience .
food is not bad , and relatively cheap .
i would gladly go to other locations though .
the guac is n't good .
that guy looks really pissed off .
there are no filibertos in northern california .
but i did not listen .
if so , i am so sorry .
my fiance and i just left there .
what a waste of a meal !
on two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting .
wan na add rice or beans ?
place is just nasty dirty !
then i called back several times and nobody answered .
the meat was horrible and very low quality .
be sure to avoid this location at all costs .
worst place to stop and eat in the morning .
this is not the first time .
seems only one person works at this time .
chicken quesadilla and an arizona burrito took _num_ minutes .
it tasted more like plain ground beef .
the potatoes were n't fully cooked .
i 'm not a huge fan .
the staff is n't overly friendly inside .
this place is the worse .
plus the drive-thru is hella slow .
tried to charge me $ _num_ .
def not my next choice .
probably one of the worse filibertos in the area !
_num_ mins and still waiting for one order .
that carne asada was fire going in and out .
probably wont be back .
even for a crappy mexican place .
bacon , egg , cheese , tortilla .
yelp makes you select a star but zero stars !

this coffee shop is kind of the worst .
very poor customer service .
i 'm not likely to recommend this joint .

i am never setting foot in this establishment again .
the food is fresh but very bland .
the tofu was disgusting .
the satay came out first and it was ok .
the noodle dish was the worst dish .
the noodles were really hard .

sorry folks , but this place is terrible .
third , the vegetable selection is limited .
my bowl was quite soupy , but very bland .
the sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever .
why not just charge one price for all ?
it was shaved , and was kinda tough .
veggies and toppings were fresh , but limited .
more salad topping stuff then anything else .
sadly , this was not one of them .
this place is missing one key ingredient : flavor .
but wait ... free frozen yogurt !
i highly suggest not eating here .
even the chicken went bad .

just kind of a pathetic experience .
i received terrible customer service today at this location .
so very disappointed and frustrating .
you should n't be doing the job otherwise .

nothing more than `` tolerable '' .
her response , `` i 'm not on anymore .
i flag down another waitress _num_ minutes later .
will not be going there ever again !
unfortunately everything else about this place was disappointing .
to me that is just terrible customer service .
no omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet .

i am not a patient , my husband is .
rating is for overall poor customer service .
i would n't spend another dime with these guys .
that _num_ nuggets per sauce .
obviously that 's why i did n't get onions .

it was n't a very big coffee shop .
the place was crowded with people stopping in .
she did n't give us the correct discount .
coffee is ok , i 've had better .
just so-so for a coffee place .
the biggest problem though are the drinks .
sadly , i was disappointed in the results .
not a bit of it in this one .
sorry but these owners are quite something .
he then hung up with no further comment .
perhaps their phone manners are just what is lacking .

those days are long gone .

this place is ridiculously inefficient .
do yourself a favor , find some other provider .

bummer , big waste of time and effort .
the meats were pretty bland .
its really bad , trust me .
this place has gone downhill .

without any taste to keep them in business .
i went in for _num_ slices .

i wish i could get my money back .
all in all a very frustrating experience .
they quoted me $ _num_ for everything .
i wo n't be using it .
have to wait til monday .
do not bother with this place !
biggest disappointment i 've ever experienced .
i can not even begin to think right now !
i had a horrible experience with these clowns .
do n't trust this business .
no apology , no refund , no nothing .
they just want to suck money from us .
chains like this ( e.g .
so i scheduled an appt for the next day .
i basically gave them _num_ for nothing .
_num_ on your side could care less .
this is not how you run a business .
anyway , they said they could squeeze me in .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
all the mechanics are idiots .
of course not , cause they need the money .
unfortunately this was a bright red flag for me .
this place is crap .
3rd time ; my husband comes too .
that 's my _num_ cents ... .
never really had any problems just rude employees .
worst customer service ive ever seen .

these people do n't give a craps .
i refuse to ever go to this one again .
she was n't very friendly .
should have been my first warning .
this process could have been handled better .
this place was so weird !
looks are n't everything .
it 's empty and dumpy looking .
we significantly bring this average down .
my money 's on no .
maybe you could use it as a paper weight ?
other than that , stay away .
my order came with soup , i chose lentil .
the falafel however was just not good at all .
i should 've stayed home and saved my money .
the falafel though -- worst i 've ever had .
it 's dried out and flavorless .
however , i cant say that was the case .
for starters our drinks were terrible .
they do not have ginger ale .
the rice was plain , and lacked substance .
did n't get a chance to eat here .
only _num_ tables had diners .
we were n't greeted at the door very quickly .
other friends says eh food .

way too much drama and bs here !
this place is _num_ stars at most .
waiting for another _num_ minutes .

salsa was meh , chips were stale .
chicken enchiladas had no flavor .
service was not the best .
i was disappointed with my experience here .
i could have made way better tacos at home .

not worth the visit .
wasnt worth the money i spent .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
the water taste bad .
dont waste your time and money at this place .
made me very sad .
the salsa tasted like tomato and onion .
my wife was similarly unimpressed .

the sales agent was very deceiving in the transaction .
you have been warned .
had a not so good experience at nello 's .
and sadly so has the pizza .
the onions could be tasted in a few bites .
so i just ate and left .
and an hour later nellos lost .
and _num_ minutes later our food was delivered .
nellos will not see our dollars again .
this restaurant was just okay to me .
it is n't even busy in here .
this was my third experience with nellos .
i 'm sorry but the chains follow through .
unless the management does n't care .
too bad a long block away from my house .
this was my first visit .
particularly their pepperoni pineapple pizza .
the service has been mediocre at best .
not old ... but certainly not freshly made .
after _num_ minutes my wings came out .
_num_ stars for service , _num_ star for food .
the takeout host was sorry .
no explanation , no attempt to make it right .

the interior is tired and dingy too .
i left thoroughly unimpressed .
other than that , it was just a disappointment .
customer service is not on their menu .
sorry nello 's - your out !
it would n't be worth it to seat us !
so disgusting to turn customers away !
the pizzas are inconsistent .
immediately to the trash .
wo n't be back to this location .
no part of the experience has me rushing back .
to me , that means old , cold popcorn .
where , exactly , is my $ _num_ going ?
ca n't say i 'll be going back .
sooooo , $ _num_ for a ticket .
okay , kinda expensive , but i get it .
i 'm not sure whose fault this is .
not worth $ _num_ .
they ripped us off .
not going there again if i can help it .
i mean , it 's a movie theater .
not to be irritated throughout .
the men 's bathroom was horribly dirty and sticky .
the beverage holder looked clean enough though .
but everything was so ridiculously unorganized .
next , i waited twenty minutes for my drink .
also , slow wi-fi .
staff was less then thrilled to be at work .
this location gives marshall 's a bad name .
i knew az mills was ghetto ... .
our business is obviously wanted and appreciated elsewhere .
one of the worst experiences in customer service .
ordered something from a very helpful gentlemen last saturday .
not a fan of the new ownership .
needless to say i took my puppies elsewhere .
not the place to take your cat .
it was loud and chaotic .
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this review .
i am so so disappointed .
not the worst , but certainly not ideal .
, but no one called anyway .
sorry i will not be taking her back .
it 's not that bad , just nothing special .
probably will not return due to issues with this .
longest wait in a drive thru ever .
no thanks ... just dont show it available .
seriously i threw it away .
the office staff is incompetent and rude !
one of the worst experiences with a doctor .
only then would he listen to me .
staff was extremely unprofessional .
... bottom line , i hate this place .
wo n't be going there again .
they really need to get a better drive-through speaker .
never planning on ordering from here again .
by this time , my side item was cold .
i would give zero stars if i could .
_num_ minutes later , i got it .
overall disappointed at this sonic .
sonic should be ashamed of themselves .
they really know how lower standards .
well _num_ minutes later i still have no food .
which does n't happen often .
i wo n't waste my $ _num_ there again .
i will not be back to this location .
the employees were rude .
monday night , service was extremely slow here .
do n't frequent if your in a rush .
the service here is absolutely horrible .
the whole experience was completely awkward .
also no mirror at all .
long wong 's was like that , for example .
i do n't know how people can eat here .
the food is all grease and fat .
fries are made more of oil than potato .
plus that the coke tasted watered down .
what a terrible experience .
i might however bring my own blue cheese .
told me there was nothing she could do .
fridays , chile 's , etc . )
i have been here _num_ times .
the pizza tasted fairly plan and very greasy .
this location is their worst .
wings friday night tasted like vinegar .
poor choice to spend your $ $ .
they took my money and never came back .
no drinks ignored my request for napkins .
because the service is a hit or a miss .
my first visit , the servers were very attentive .
do not waste your money on the food !
i wo n't be eating here ever again .
very disappointed and wo n't be coming back .
my worst experience ever .
tasted like buffalo sauce .
however , they 're getting way too expensive .
a pack of _num_ wings is almost six dollars .
that 's $ _num_ a wings .
such a bad experience !
please change to someone else !
not impressed ... the inventory is old and outdated .
most of the stuff in this place is junk .
the male check out clerk was super rude .
the place seemed dirty and depressing .
not a good selection of beads in my opinion .
this is terrible customer service !
the salsa was alright too .
i ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco .
the beans were nasty .
not the refried beans im used to .
sauce was gross , etc .
i 'm not going to come back .
the chips were even stale .
it did n't feel clean .
just not a good experience .
not worth even _num_ star !
the service here is awful !
no silverware on the tables when we arrived .
even then they could n't get it right .
the place was empty so they had no excuse .
at least their food is cheap and usually hot !
plus , they also fill up your tires .
if i could give zero stars i would .
this is the worst place ever .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
walked out spending $ _num_ .
_num_ is expensive but did n't have a wait .
they did not get all the old fluid out .
i missed my class because of that .
do n't go to this place .
_num_ star because zero is n't an option .
i will never use jiffy lube again .
no it was funky shrimp that was slightly slimy .
i will never make that mistake again .
i probably wo n't visit golden egg roll again .
there are too many other places to try .
i am very willing to wait for quality food .
very large portions , but also very pricey .
this place is pretty bad .
no ice , but they only brought one drink .
thanks for the disappointment , golden egg roll .
i 'm not even sure where to begin .
i will not order from them again .
i also ordered chicken chow mein .
chinese corn , mushroom , the big peas .
no chow mein some other kind of mein .
the restrooms were n't kept clean enough .
they were one of the worst kept restrooms .
online ordering is apparently a gamble .
the food was cold and our drinks were flat .
the egg foo young is disgusting .
the service is not good either .
i have never been that sick in my life .
went here for lunch today to get mongolian beef .
once i got my food it was obviously cold .
nearly asking for the hours was not enough .
i lasted about another _num_ seconds before leaving .
i wo n't be back .
literally , the next day my hands were sore .
for me it was just ok .
the salsa and chips were the highlight .
the service here is poor .
the food was `` ok '' - nothing special .
the service on the other hand was horrible .
how no one walked out was beyond me .
they were really friendly though .
standard rice , standard beans .
thankfully , i did n't vomit .
i passed it by laying down for two hours .
it 's located on the left side further south .
-the food quality was just ok .
no rice , no beans .
tried this place tonight because husband loves it .
i , however , did not like it .
it 's just mushy .
do n't waste your money here .
you would be better off at chipotle .
the beans are homemade so that was a plus .
just not the salsa or chips .
-the decor is awful !
the food was bad .
as in , my chile relleno tasted rotten .
third they are not at all kid friendly .
fourth and the worst thing was the carne asada .
even the salsa could n't help it .
overall i was disgusted .
overall a very poor place .
sat in bar as i travel often for work .
do n't believe the hype .
the service is horrible .
no quality mexican places in tempe ... .
left _num_ minutes later .
i probably wo n't be coming back .
it 's a little better than this place .
you wo n't feel rushed !
no cheese or onions in either of our enchiladas .
ceilings tiles are broken .
i felt bad not leaving him a tip .
i am not one to complain .
sorry for bad review .
if you need cleaning , find another cleaner .
i wo n't be back .
geez get over yourself buddy !
sent me away to get change .
if i could give them negative stars i would .
do not come to this business .
they may have given them to another customer .
poor customer service , a mess of a business .
i hate to do this but this is ridiculous .
unfortunately , don had gone to lunch .
i left my call back number , again .
they would be _num_ stars bad !
i was thinking minor work nothing major .
scare tactics is want brake masters is about .
very disappointed in this store .
a few weeks later the radiator starts to leak !
not very informative about what they do .
next stop : jiffy lube !
quoted $ _num_ more than what i paid .
brake masters never even checked !
so i searched for a car with a/c .
like i was asking him to do my taxes .
please , i would like to know .
i will never return to this store .
mountain dew sucked though .
did n't tell anyone to clean up .
one horrible order i had ever made !
she ruined my day .
soggy , falling apart and flavorless .
it was lukewarm and dry !
they 're doing some remodeling , but no excuse !
i will not be returning to this location .
the food was n't terrible .
ca n't follow instructions .
i would not recommend this location .
good thing i 'm not vegetarian !
it does n't taste bad and service is ok .
so sad for me and lack of a pickle .
they ended up correctly it , just annoying .
was not friendly at all .
not worth the calories .
i was not impressed with my salad .
it just bummed me out .
this is not the store for me .
i will not be returning .
i just do n't trust them .
the problem is the customer service is usually terrible .
it was n't like the store was busy .
the the help you get there is terrible .
it did n't surprise me .
bottom line , i wish this store was better .
such a fool i am , duh ?
i will not be returning .
no thanks , see you later somewhere else .
i 'm not going back here .
i wo n't be coming back .
never will i ever give this place another chance .
i 'm a server .
and that has never happened before .
he was so rude to me .
just because its cheap dont do it .
horrible gel polish job !
i 'm going to have to hide my hands .
the shape at first was all bad .
they were not dry .
horrible way to spend a tuesday afternoon .
it was just a complete mess .
this place is a nightmare !
out of principle i will never return there .
it would n't let me give no stars ... .
terrible place , ripped me off multiple times .
i wish i could give this place zero stars .
it 's a legitimate scam .
this used to be my favorite place .
no more weekly stops here for me .
uh , yeah , this place .
no explanation , no courtesy , just no .
nothing special about them .
$ _num_ for a pedicure .
i wish there was an option for zero stars .
what 's a `` bed tax '' ?
_num_ ) housekeeping staff were pleasant and working hard .
so even the good stations do n't look good .
there was no way to comfortably sleep on it .
the mattress fell through the frame .
apparently the driver never went back to get him .
the cab ride home cost us over $ _num_ .
i would rather stay at a motel _num_ .
the airport shuttle was slow .
he did n't even report a loss light cap .
that is an absolute joke !
this place is terrible .
you never actually get seen at your appointment time .
the receptionist did not look at me .
she was rude to other patients too .
are you kidding me ?
seems a little shady to me .
this is business _num_ .
i wo n't be back .
unfortunately , that has n't happened yet .
also , i ordered my entree mild to medium .
hate when they mess that up !
my quest for indian food in the valley continues .
popped in just after noon , its not busy .
i request a booth and decide on the buffet .
now , we all like tuna , sushi style .
one of the worst places i visited recently !
the only vegetables included potatoes and an occasional pea .
what a horrible experience !
six patrons plus me ... all very unhappy .
the food was just ok , though not remarkable .
i chose this place , and everyone was unhappy .
the food was horrible .
the place was nice looking though .
neither do i anymore .
apparently they do n't need the patrons money anymore .
that 's okay , not interested .
beware of terrible service .
would not honor rei 's return policy .
she has horrible customer service skills .
i finished the transaction not wanting to argue .
everyone there is much nicer , in my opinion .
prices were out of this world high .
last mechanic to see it was rei tech .
overall , i would rather go to walmart .
their shipping policy sucks , to put it lightly .
a store with no return policy without receipt ?
i did try them , neither worked for me .
i just do not need it for now .
so i have no choice but keep it .
the service here leaves a lot to be desired .
just left rei and had the worst experience .
rod the manager is so rude and offensive .
i wo n't be back .
i got white tips and im not too impressed .
just a top gel coat ?
not that long of a procedure .
overall , i would n't return .
this place was awful .
i sat and waited there for another _num_ minutes .
she never said anything to me , though .
do not go to this place !
it was pretty painful and definitely drew blood .
very unprofessional and i will never be back .
i am never going back .
the gel manicures do not last .
the shape of the nails was also poorly done .
my sister 's nails also turned out very weird .
the color also looked bad .
uneven color and chunky in some places .
my nails turned out the worst .
it was an overall painful experience .
it was really depressing .
too many nail places around here .
would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy !
this place deserves zero stars .
today is the worst !
i am never coming here again !
i even gave them a second chance .
no massage even though we paid for it .
she was too nice to say anything .
spare yourself avoid this nail shop .
it was a rip off .
do not get your eyebrows done here !
mama 's not happy !
i would give zero stars if i could .
i find this unacceptable .
your order will not be taken ! ''
i 'm not real anxious about coming back .
i ca n't deny that .
$ _num_ drafts and $ _num_ wells .
at least my teeth wo n't move . ''
worst dentist i 've ever went to .
compete waste of my time .
but no , i know how you work .
i was shocked and angry .
even your dental location is a trashy looking place .
even your teeth did n't look that great .
so if anyone wants their time wasted ?
go elsewhere for your dental needs .
other than that , do n't bother .
i wo n't be going back .
i ca n't imagine going back again .
update : urine and sewage smell has gone away .
cheap bar food and beer .
wo n't be using their facilities .
maybe _num_ if i 'm feeling generous .
personally there are much better options in tempe .
i ordered chicken salad stuffed tomato .
would have preferred a croissant or bagel .
unfortunately , aside from the jam food was unimpressive .
she had no idea what she was doing .
quality service is terrible .
she did not want to help at all .
the copy center staff is rude except for alma .
i called on friday for an update .
ahhh ... the smell of cleaning fluids .
nothing wrong with them ... just lackluster and boring .
but lackluster and without remarkable flavor or texture .
it would be too poorly executed to exist .
will you stop eating crap just because of nostalgia ?
it smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners .
i will not be returning to this location .
generally , a consistent disappointment !
even the garlic toast was meh !
i just sent the following message through their website .
we were all hungry and this was totally unacceptable .
_num_ years ago red devil was bomb .
then , we have a _num_ month old .
i was totally looking forward to it.
i was totally looking forward to it.
my pizza was soggy .
the beer is dirt cheap .
awful service , awful food .
the pizza was lukewarm when it arrived .
did n't know this place was here .
first off the location is n't the cleanest .
this place is outdated big time .
looks like a bad _num_ 's hotel carpet .
tried chili and that was a mistake .
but ca n't see that happening .
the soup was bland to say the least .
he ate the chicken and left everything else also .
in frustrating , i said `` jesus !
i can not agree with lauren v .
it just made me sick !
needless to say , i purchased my tires elsewhere .
i 'm used to _num_ % and up .
uh huh , bad rotors , whatever .
seriously , this place sucks .
avoid this place at all costs .
not so much buddy .
$ _num_ my ass .
just go to discount tires .
transmission flush not a good idea .
big o tire tempe , you are the worst .
about a month later another tire had a leak .
wtf were you doing for _num_ 1/2 hours then ?
i thought my tire was going to fall off .
i said hell no you lied to me .
this place is terrible .
bad service all around .
do n't ever go here for anything !
and i only got an oil change .
this is where i get pissed !
_num_ to mount my tire on the rim .
not a drop of oil spilled .
customer service is seriously lacking .
this place is horrible .
it took them _num_ hours to do this .
this place is horrible !
they have screwed me over twice already .
if i could give them _num_ stars i would .
what a horrible experience .
that 's not how you handle customer service properly .
that 's not a way to keep business .
unfortunately i had two dishonest situations .
too bad i ca n't go back anymore .
obviously i will not be going back .
this big o is crap in my opinion .
i wo n't be back .
do n't waste your time at this dump .
i wish their system would not fail me .
things got particularly bad when i moved out .
first off , no , maria .
fourth , let 's talk about this ridiculous fee .
it 's not really my problem .
three days later , no response .
its a huge ordeal !
well , she did the most terrible job !
i have not yet received an email .
are you kidding me ?
lived here recently , _num_ years .
the walls were paper thin .
this is by far my worst living experience ever !
she was very rude and talked down to us .
suddenly , i had to pay an additional deposit .
that was very , very difficult .
my move in date is may _num_ .
do not trust these people .
they were so condescending !
do n't walk , to anywhere but here !
seriously this place is hell .
just showed up and they were not done .
a week and they 're not done ?
i asked for a refund and walked out .
you had my number , could have called .
this place is gross and now haunted .
the decorations were weird , even for christmas .
my whole group left after _num_ round .
first the ordering of our food was confusing .
i 'm not done yet .
this annoyed him , obviously .
i said , it 's not all here yet .
and this is not one of them .
sorry , folks , that 's the truth .
a little annoying for a first timer customer .
the fries are awful .
what a terrible hot dog and brat .
everything about ted 's is mediocre .
the prices are n't that good either .
it does n't live up to the hype .
just a hot dog .
all in all , we were not impressed .
cook line is slow .
overall they are not cheap for what you get .
bun was slightly stale and hard .
chili dog was average .
chili was below average .
stop charging for refills , ted 's .
but we will not be back .
i would hate to see more food get wasted .
low quality , tasteless hot dog .
the onion rings were decent though .
the service is just horrible .
i threw out most of my food , honestly .
for _num_ bucks , i would expect more .
maybe i did not get the right thing .
i would always get the white hot .
kept hearing about this place so tried it .
every week , i try a new restaurant .
the menu said it was $ _num_ .
she then said i can have whatever i want .
ok ... forget it .
they charge $ _num_ per refill .
i was not thrilled with this ted 's experience .
not going to be coming back to ted 's .
no new england style buns .
a cheap potato bun does n't cut it .
they must not be that hungry for money .
i got chili and it was disgusting .
it was full of grease .
the hot dog my man had was nothing great .
and the dog just took over my thoughts anyway .
the mac and cheese was also disappointing .
no flavor : - ( no punch .
my onion rings are awful .
service was the worst thing i have ever seen .
they never put my dog even on the grill .
overpriced and overcrowded for no reason .
loyal ted 's customer for _num_ years .
i doubt this old establishment will stay in business .
straight out the 80s .
i could n't take it !
i really , really wanted to like this place .
your food is crap and always will be crap .
the food was bad i didnt like anything .
i feel like i got robbed .
i am thirsty , unhappy , and still hungry .
( do n't put a deposit down on anything .
cost $ _num_ and took _num_ hour .
do n't put a deposit down .
the worst place i 've ever been to .
worst dry cleaning service ever !
i do not recommend taking your dry cleaning here !
, though they were brand new .
the workers could n't find my item .
unfortunately , my experience only became worse from here .
very low budget dry cleaner .
i will definitely not be going back here .
worst place for dry cleaning and laundry .
warranty is for _num_ ( ! )
no wait at home depot .
save your $ _num_ and get a pedicure instead .
no one knows where my paper work is .
who the hell runs this school ?
the waiting room is a sad sad sight .
nothing odd there right ?
it was really bad .
in my case it was a miss .
long story ... short version ... .
i sent out a check for that month .
worst service i 've had in years .
the place is nice but totally not worth it .
it 's not worth it at all .
cause the alternative is one boring salad choice .
i ca n't believe i tipped that jerk .
do n't waste your money on the food !
probably wo n't go back .
buffalo chicken was like mcdonald 's chicken nuggets .
terrible and inexperienced service .
not in my humble opinion .
too dark and loud .
some tables have very poor views .
will not eat there again .
the view was better than the food and service .
i could n't even taste the steak .
that steak cost $ _num_ .
just bland and boring .
oh , and the wine list is weak .
i was very disappointed .
it 's too bad .
service was beyond slow .
salads , not main course .
no apology , nothing .
_num_ star for the view as it is awesome .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
never , never , never !
what a gigantic disappointment !
believe the bad reviews here .
my free beer was their citrus beer .
it was n't worth it .
except the guy filling waters and cleaning plates .
wow one of the worst .
the salmon was raw , my steak was tough .
this place is awful .
my husband 's pasta was inedible .
the entree was pathetic !
my cocktail was tasty , no complaints there .
this restaurant is sadly disappointing .
main course was cold and bland .
would n't recommend or go there again .
brought me the wrong entree .
more like just another restaurant attached to a hotel .
an education of the waitstaff would be helpful .
the dessert was the worst .
the guacamole was pretty mediocre .
the signature bistro steak was so bland .
i would n't recommend this place .
better spend ur money elsewhere .
but we were put in booth without a view .
sunset view was _num_ star .
everything else was a _num_ .
it was a very sad looking plate .
the menu did n't have a huge variety .
ate here again last night and it was disappointing .
too bad - because it 's pricey .
my $ _num_ steak looked so small and sad .
it was ok but no big deal .
took one bite and it tasted very badly burnt .
yesterday i had to kill some small flying thing .
it was late , i was tired .
please , do n't stay here .
i booked a room with a king size bed .
my colleague and i went out to dinner .
dude , it 's _num_ .
avoid it at all costs .
you 've been warned .
the downside was communication amongst employees was awful !
there was nothing wrong with my ac !
i probably wo n't be back .
key to room failed .
waited 30+ minutes to get assistance .
for a marriott , this place sure did disappoint .
the room looked run down and cheap .
at least on a low setting ?
would give this shit place zero stars if possible .
i was thinking relaxation ... umm no .
he was very unprofessional and rude .
seems a little backwards to me !
the communication among the front desk staff was ridiculous .
i did not stay at this hotel .
i find marriott 's lack of customer service appalling .
this is not acceptable behavior .
unfortunately , the room did not allow that .
classic bad business : under delivering after over promising .
_num_ : the cold breakfast .
all in all ... we were very disappointed .
it was a waste of money .
needless to say i wo n't be returning .
spend your hard earned money elsewhere .
on the bright side , the spa was fabulous .
not just slow , but wrong .
my food , a pizza , was not great .
wow no help and rude .
if i could give zero stars i would .
typical reaction of a giant company against one customer .
my room is still not ready !
_num_ hours wasted time .
someone was smoking pot heavily .
if you value customer service do n't stay here .
food service around pool could offer better options .
there is nothing around the resort though .
i kinda felt like i was stuck there .
beautiful setting but horrible service especially at the pool .
then he demanded my charge card .
beware , will never return to this resort .
this hotel staff is awful .
this hotel staff is awful .
second , the pool area is a nightmare .
someone is clearly not doing their job .
maybe a bad day , who knows .
sad to see really .
we will not be back .
i 'm beyond annoyed .
if i could give them _num_ stars i would .
do n't stay there , that is ridiculous .
as they just do n't care .
it was very unpleasant .
it was n't anything special .
the room was clean just small .
the customer service is not there .
problem is still there .
lack of attention to detail .
first encounter upon check-in was not good .
the staff needs major upgrade on customer service skills .
their fish and produce was gross !
my air conditioner in my car was not blowing .
do n't waste your time ... ick !
below par chinese msg .
the white rice was hard and cold .
so i will never stop here again .
avoid at all costs .
that is information the average person would not know .
i would not recommend this floral shop .
but this is not .
but the other set is really bad .
tempe acura is _num_ miles away from my place .
acura of tempe service department are rip off artists !
will never do business with this dealership again .
it was the manicure that changed my whole experience .
this was n't the worst part .
yes ... it gets worse .
i was wrong ... they hurt even more .
my pedicure is done in about _num_ minutes .
from the start she was not very friendly .
the things they sale are over priced period .
that is not a trim .
there is nothing that can be fixed .
this hotel is disgusting .
the room stinks as well .
$ _num_ for _num_ nights ?
the stay other wise was so-so ... .
i checked in on monday night no problem .
which does n't make any sense .
also , the complimentary breakfast was a joke .
there were only waffles and cereal .
the breakfast was gross .
not worth the $ _num_ we paid .
this place is disgusting .
i feel dirty for even walking in the room .
they gave it a _num_ star .
this place is disgusting !
they are such a rip off !
you did n't bother telling anyone ?
the rooms were small and outdated and barely clean .
the pool was shut down by the county .
did i ever leave disappointed .
dude , get over yourself .
not a good experience staying here .
the cashier was very slow .
i mean , they get paid to do that !
no wonder this place has such bad reviews .
life is too short .
so i gave this one a try .
my cart does n't roll straight .
i 'm not surprised .
there are no baskets , just carts .
fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses .
they 've never checked my receipt at the exit .
patrons leave their carts at the bus stop .
hardly any selection on halloween make up .
one star for lack of open registers .
the problem is the store .
i have shopped here on many occasions .
they 're gross in general .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i am thoroughly disappointed and extremely angry .
never again will i step foot in that store .
there are never any open registers .
the produce is disgusting .
terrible , slow customer service .
this walmart is ridiculous .
there are hardly any cashiers available .
worst walmart in town .
you ca n't even trust your customers ?
always end up waiting _num_ minutes plus .
that is not a good thing by the way .
this place however has earned it .
worst wal-mart in arizona .
they always have crap all over the place .
i am not going back another visit .
this was my first visit here .
they ended up looking ok , but sloppy .
i will not be back , ever .
i stopped by because my regular salon was booked .
it was so disappointing that he did n't apologize .
he did n't care if i stayed or left .
the woman told me $ _num_ .
$ _num_ for a pedicure ?
it actually costs $ _num_ for a basic pedicure .
she was not friendly .
she was so rude !
my nails ended up horrible !
too bad i ca n't rate it _num_ stars !
maybe my last experience was a fluke .
-- -- -- they never run through your file !
but no one called me on monday .
-- -- however no one called me back .
and they will send it to me before _num_ .
last time they fell on their face for me .
would not recommend them for anything !
never missed a payment .
yet another bank that just flat out sucks !
i was left in waiting room for _num_ hours .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i said no again .
she was still rude and unhelpful .
the worst medical facility ever !
would never go back to the urgent care again .
my complaint is with the strange wait times .
i will never use another pure fitness gym again .
i canceled my membership at that point .
only they sell new furniture instead of used cars .
she is being rude '' .
not even going to mention the lack of service .
wow , was she rude !
do n't waste your time .
what a waste of $ _num_ !
highly disappointed and will never go back .
i will also leave a negative review online .
worst service i have ever seen .
ruined the whole nice sectional experience for us .
this location was extremely disappointing .
walked around for _num_ minutes , still not greeted .
the protection plan is a rip off .
most of the stuff is cheap .
stay far away from this place .
supposedly he was n't there .
he refused to even consider it .
i kept it simple - _num_ on pump _num_ .
my husband , son and i were super tired .
she was not as helpful as i thought .
my order was completely wrong .
i was sadly mistaken .
it does not work again .
i am annoyed and irritated .
do not make a mistake like i did .
total quote : $ _num_ .
just had a pair of jeans hemmed here .
the job was quick , but mediocre .
will not be back .
it was only _num_ am .
she did n't do anything but spend thirty seconds .
this is not the place .
she wrote over the _num_ with a _num_ !
would not recommend this place to an enemy .
avoid this location at all costs !
this is n't the doctors office it 's tires .
no respect for repeat customers or their time .
my coworker and i stopped there got lunch yesterday .
could n't wait to get home .
but it is n't .
this place is a huge mess .
but i ca n't do it .
this place was a disaster !
they even charge an entrance fee .
not my type of place i admit .
too bad too , and management does n't care .
too bad it never came !
we just will not be coming back .
my wife 's food was cold .
i asked for cheese ravioli with non meat sauce .
vegetarian check your plates .
i wish there were - starts .
this place is the rudest place i 've been .
( really ppl , it 's arizona ) .
this is n't a danny 's family car wash .
has n't been for _num_ years .
does n't even look in your direction .
bad customer service really gets under my skin .
she was down right rude to me .
she had the worst attitude .
general manager is super rude .
leave me alone and just let me work out .
i felt bad because it was his birthday .
total waste of time .
glad i did my homework .
slow to get your car back for oil change .
i would never recommend this car dealership to anyone .
it was one bad situation after another .
the whole experience was a waste of time .
he could not find anything wrong with the car .
he said he would email it to me .
one day went by ... no email .
they choose wrong and guess what ?
the problem was never fixed !
the service department does not deserve even one star !
i scheduled an oil change and tire rotation .
his behavior was very rude and unprofessional !
i wish i could give negative stars !
how could they mess that up ?
that was n't the problem .
as in did n't bite .
i was seconds away from walking out .
this is shady horrific .
i ordered some chili and it was ok .
we wo n't be going back .
they cater to the regulars over _num_ .
not my choice in spending a friday night .
the bathrooms are dirty and need an update .
waste of my time !
however , this particular one pissed me off today .
i just had a terrible first experience here .
what business does n't have a pen ?
by far the worst bagel shop in town .
floors are disgusting as well .
no one was there .
soon , i guess , meant another five minutes .
i was very disappointed tonight .
they have very poor service .
horrible and non caring `` customer service '' .
this was the worst , ever !
towels are rough , torn and stained .
no televisions on the cardio equipment .
the _num_ day challenge is a joke .
makes me a little nervous about auto pay .
sad considering how nice it was when we joined .
not worth the price at all .
nickel and dime you to death , stay away !
the nickel and dining is the worst .
just cancelled my membership .
i have little ones who take swim lessons .
it made my kids uncomfortable .
a mistake , no doubt .
yes _num_ percent discount !
all this nonsense for $ _num_ ?
avoid at all costs .
awful , awful , awful !
the whole experience was a nightmare !
other customers were laughing at me !
these people are beyond rude !
they did a terrible job .
they did n't even last a week .
bank of america as a whole sucks .
_num_ days from today .
they are ridiculously slow .
they really are dumb .
service is now painfully slow .
avoid until the change management again .
it again comes down to being too much effort .
the tuna did n't taste fresh .
its just not my kind of food .
i am not even sure .
i do n't even remember it .
i have no idea who goes to this restaurant .
the bread is hot but nothing to rave over .
underneath , the chicken was dry and overdone .
i would not recommend this salon .
it was kind of bland .
this was n't that type of experience .
at that point , i just wanted to leave .
`` just for me '' my foot .
: ( so disappointed .
looks like we 'll be sticking with pizza hut .
was told _num_ to _num_ min .
this is a terrible dominos location .
undercooked pizza crust is unpleasant .
i always use them when i play jazz . ''
poor mic selection too .
why you may ask ?
_num_ years of theft is long enough !
i did n't make it that far .
i wo n't be back .
no greeting , no help .
passed 4-5 employees , nothing .
same thing goes for a lot of other gear .
this safeway is n't worth your time or money !
this store never has enough cashiers .
_num_ minutes later i had my food .
but not this place .
wo n't be going here very often .
i ordered a double cheese plain .
dollars a case profit ... kinda ridiculous .
the meat didnt taste like meat .
first of all , i would give no stars .
she was rude and inconsiderate .
our experience with this store has not been positive .
so she tried to adjust the price .
are you kidding me ?
no one asked how i was or said hello .
the tech took me to a waiting room .
she did not explain what was going on .
she was with zero professional communication .
i just do n't understand it .
the nails look terrible .
otherwise , i would look elsewhere .
anywho , we come in and request for helen .
you have lost my business for good .
well i should n't have even gone here .
not the same , not great .
look , chain restaurants limit choice .
we should know better than to go in one .
training , training , training .
we were n't happy .
thus , the _num_ stars .
there would have been absolutely no room for food !
do n't waste your time or money !
sadly , i have given up on this restaurant .
i would not waste your time going here .
server was nice , just really slow .
worst take out service ever .
was told `` _num_ to _num_ minutes '' .
but everything else was poor .
the salad and soup were just okay .
the breadsticks -- so disappointing .
it is not chicken , i swear to you .
he was oh sorry & walked away .
the food came out cold though .
witnessed one gentleman send his plate back .
i have got to remember to stop going there .
i wo n't go back again .
i need this handled before 8pm .
i 'm really bummed , yelpers .
but should n't all of that be a given ?
we did n't even bother with the frozen yogurt .
it 's horrible . ''
no fair , yc 's .
sat down to eat , was not impressed .
suffice to say , i do not recommend .
this place really is n't bad .
it just is n't great .
it is now $ _num_ to eat dinner here .
i used to love yc 's and went frequently .
one of them has severe peanut and seafood allergies .
beyond inappropriate and dangerous !
_num_ ) it 's close to my house .
now remember this is not a buffet .
that is why there are two sizes .
they told me it will be _num_ cents .
i will not pay for to go bowls .
you are not a buffet .
i found the food bland for my taste .
the food is alright nothing out of the ordinary .
i do n't even know where to begin ... .
but the food was just ok.
it 's not very good .
long wait at times though very frustrating .
nope , not anymore !
that 's half the reason why this place rocks !
what the hell dude ?
trash outside was overflowing and there were flies everywhere !
we wo n't be going back .
but tonight ... tonight was awful !
i think i waited like _num_ minutes last time .
not worth the wait for me .
for that , i am appreciative .
it 's filthy ; they 're slow .
this place gets my food wrong all the time .
change ur dang grease !
the employees also do n't seem very friendly .
i avoid this place as much as i can .
should n't that be included in a pedicure ?
my lip wax was also not executed correctly .
but the service did n't match the decor .
could n't wait to get out of there .
will not be back !
quality nails is not .
the techs rushed thru my pedi and fill .
they are so unprofessional here its unbelievable .
yet she treats me like scum .
i could n't believe it !
they suck so just do n't even bother !
absolute worst gel manicure !
it was horribly uncomfortable and very unprofessional .
i will not be returning ... .
i will not be back .
the lady that did my nails was rude .
i refused because i was already upset .
he trusted me , and ordered anyway .
_num_ minutes later we still did not have it .
the last pizza was horrible !
the white pizza was the worst .
i do n't like this .
what a waste of money !
the pizza should have been free !
no door knock , no introduction , nothing .
overall i will not order from rosati 's again .
they just raised their already high prices even higher .
nope ... never again .
could have spent half as much .
over two hours and $ _num_ + dollars later ?
the problem we typically have are long delivery times .
the staff there always seems tired and unhealthy .
it 's an empty building .
their mission statement really should n't say ... .
worst customer service ever !
i have never been this disrespected by a company .
terrible salon , terrible customer service .
well no one was there .
nothing special unless your going to the scottsdale location .
it tastes very similar to the macaroni grill .
i wo n't go back .
the food was n't bad but it was bland .
the service and decor are mediocre .
this place was horrible !
and the food was n't even that good .
no warning on the menu about it !
sauce was n't spectacular though .
this is where i have to complain .
having said that , i had a seafood ravioli .
i ca n't remember what hubby ate .
we did n't get bread refilled .
the rosemary olive oil was nice though .
the negatives were in fact all of the food .
my veal piccata was an oily salt lick .
this experience was so disappointing !
both were lacking salt .
it was also lacking in the taste department .
it was so disappointing !
the family thought it was all terrible .
the pizza was soggy and just tasted of garlic .
one pasta dish was completely bland .
it just tasted like nothing .
which is why i find this confusing and upsetting .
i also believe the pasta was not homemade .
it looked pretty but did not taste great .
also the pasta did not taste homemade .
if we take both we will loose money .
there 's no wonder they do n't have business .
this place is so strange .
we went there and it was dead .
that should have been a warning .
way too expensive for bland food .
waters came with black things floating around in them .
so i will never be back .
problem # _num_ : the food came out wrong .
if you want good italian food , keep searching .
my sister ordered the sausage and pepper risotto .
the risotto was completely undercooked .
she chose the osso bucco which came with risotto .
unfortunately my meal was horrible .
all they did was put about _num_ tables together .
there is no need to add in the fee .
so many things wrong with this place .
this just is n't my kind of dive .
outdated television sets mixed with some flat screens .
they have karaoke during the evenings most every night .
they were _num_ inches too short .
they asked me to come back the next week .
he `` was not a fan '' of them .
i am _num_ years old .
i 'm going to find another doctor .
can i give zero stars ?
it is sad , embarrassing , and extremely frustrating .
thank you for your prompt response .
we 'll start at the beginning .
i 'm not talking complicated stuff here either .
only reason i went here was for a dr .
however , each year they get worse .
this place is horrible at so many things .
upsell , upsell , upsell at this place .
not cool , guys !
deeply disappointed with this practice and medical advice .
do not recommend at all .
staff is rude and doctors are impersonal .
none of that was in the conversation .
i wish doc mike had better help .
do not use this place .
do not give them your charge card !
do not go here , go somewhere else .
that 's when things got much worse .
i finished the medication but was very ill still .
i am not pregnant , never been pregnant .
calls them _num_ hours later , same answer .
because we did n't actually get a diagnosis .
i 'm sure three times the normal price .
my fat cat gets better care than that !
waste of everyone 's time .
really makes me feel cared about .
the pa and medical assistant were terrible .
i left very unhappy with my pedicure .
the customer service was just not good .
got a pedicure and left extremely unhappy .
for starters , the place looks messy and unwelcoming .
not happy and wont return .
i am not a fan of the prices !
however i am unsure about the customer service .
i was definitely put off by that .
i am never going back !
i just can not tolerate such poor customer service .
i called _num_ places .
i was n't very impressed with the customer service .
according to other reviews , this is nothing new .
not worth the price for me .
what a messy place !
not worth my time .
well how wrong was my take on that .
be warned -- stay away !
the sushi was not good .
anyway , i felt that the food was mediocre .
could n't even taste what was inside .
the wait staff was very friendly .
first , the service was horrible .
not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience .
probably my first & last time here .
started off ok then each week got worse .
even this renovated store is a disappointment .
it 's $ _num_ for generic brand .
my experience was underwhelming .
r they going out of business ?
the food is tasteless and horrible .
it gives fast food a bad name .
this taco bell is terrible .
needless to say they lost a customer last night .
used the drive through for my son tonight .
has to be china , or possibly hell .
garlic bread was cold !
the place needs a facelift , badly .
at _num_ minutes , sorry applebee 's ... .
wo n't be going back .
wait staff seemed like they 'd rather be elsewhere .
i will not eat at this applebee 's again .
ordered half off apps menu .
you could n't order more than one per person .
and no it was n't busy .
every applebee 's is always cold .
do n't know why they are all closing !
why is every place going downhill ?
drinks ordered and arrived quickly .
we were a little slow ordering .
price is up by a $ _num_ .
this time i was not disappointed .
that 's not how you sell .
but the service is always horrible .
the drinks are the worst !
if you hate your job why work there ?
prices went up and portions went down .
then i was hung up on !
this place is a train wreck .
no manager in sight .
they called me _num_ times to confirm the appointment .
no , the weather is not their fault .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
worst customer service i have ever received .
do not buy from this store .
and no japanese curry ?
the chicken is dry when i order white meat .
i got a chicken teriyaki bowl with white chicken .
this place is not good .
it 's the worst place ever !
food was bland and not very good .
the food is too expensive .
the portions are n't very good for the price .
needless to say i wo n't be coming back .
i wo n't go back to this location .
tips jars for what exactly ?
stay away unless you want vomit .
so we took it , not everything fit !
i was very sick .
he looked at me like really .
he seemed unhappy about that .
ah , well , why ?
other than that , stay away !
anyways , thats beside the point .
they really could improve their on-site service .
the sitting areas and tables are in poor display .
i do n't remember the bathrooms .
waste of time and money !
no lighting on most holes .
seems unsafe and dirty .
this place closed permanently in dec _num_ .
not worth the bother .
the food is okay , nothing special .
i wish i could give no stars .
this is just gross !
this red robin is sad and old .
the food is the big problem at this location .
no sports package at a popular burger place ?
i did n't finish my food .
our server was nice but slow .
i will not be coming back .
not a good place to watch the nfl .
plates were chipped on corners .
red robin , you 're breaking my heart .
it should not be called a hospital .
the whole experience was bad .
customer service is really lacking .
this experience convinced me to take my business elsewhere !
they are sleazy and unreliable .
worst experience ever for vehicle maintenance .
so - thanks hyundai tempe for being so deceiving .
they have lost my car on two separate occasion .
the salesman was very rude to my wife .
absolutely worst service department we have ever dealt with .
bad enough to drive anyone crazy while driving .
four hours and still no oil change .
do not buy from this dealership .
absolutely worst service department we have ever dealt with .
bad enough to drive anyone crazy while driving .
four hours and still no oil change .
do not buy from this dealership .
this dealer is just pathetic .
we really regret buying from them .
will not go back .
i walked out and left .
i will try to make this short .
customer service went downhill .
wish i could tell you .
i called monday and left a message .
low pressure and she answered all our questions .
no help from the dealership .
we wait and wait and wait .
they do not care about the service quality .
this is unacceptable and shows their awful customer service .
this comment stated for me to call the gm ?
the car is _num_ years old .
i wo n't be back .
that night , i had no dash lights .
jiffy lube national customer service was not much better .
fast food just does not get it .
this company must have idiots in their marketing department .
the medium was too large .
is n't that their jobs ?
they also look miserable .
he had never done this before .
again the next night , but less so .
obviously , he was n't being provided with water .
the worst pet store in the valley .
she was even worse than the clerk !
ashley and the girl cashier are awful .
female night manager is so rude !
the professionalism was ridiculous as well .
and noticed blood running down my dog 's neck .
are n't there cameras ?
do they not clean up dogs who have anxiety ?
he could n't care less .
_num_ min later our chips and queso show up .
i said why not .
this place is horrible .
the overall experience was mediocre at best .
the atmosphere was naturally very loud .
$ _num_ , she said .
when she said $ _num_ , i was surprised .
an order of _num_ wings was $ _num_ .
seems a little high for a 5:30 time slot .
it was n't even that hot either .
both times i walked out disappointed .
the chicken is lost in the heavy breading .
servers walked by and no one acknowledged us .
bww did n't win me as a customer .
but i did n't love buffalo wild wings .
so , so , so greasy - yuck !
which to me , are way too sugary .
their service is terrible .
flatbread was awful and the wings were just ok .
unfortunately , it was worse than previous experiences .
this place is nasty .
someone in that kitchen is n't cooking food right .
get order home and again it is not right .
this is not a gourmet dinning .
wings were not good as well .
in a word disappointing .
tonight was the worst experience ever .
so we walked out , starving and all .
we will never return again .
no sorry or anything .
lame in every sense of the word .
not the service or the food .
because both of this things sucked .
mean while my daughter is hungry and getting tired .
hmm i know there was more to this salad .
i recall reading carrots and various cheeses .
dinner was a waste of time and money .
went back after the owner replied to my review .
unfortunately it 's just about impossible .
no kidding second time had hair in the nachos !
bottom line the place is managed poorly .
horrible way to run a business !
the cheesecake bites were so terrible .
the service was terrible as well .
